    "markdown": "# next.config.js Options: turbo | Next.js\n\n## turbo (Experimental)\n\nTurbopack can be customized to transform different files and change how modules are resolved.\n\n> **Good to know**:\n> \n> *   These features are experimental and will only work with `next --turbo`.\n> *   Turbopack for Next.js does not require loaders nor loader configuration for built-in functionality. Turbopack has built-in support for css and compiling modern JavaScript, so there's no need for `css-loader`, `postcss-loader`, or `babel-loader` if you're using `@babel/preset-env`.\n\n## [webpack loaders](#webpack-loaders)\n\nIf you need loader support beyond what's built in, many webpack loaders already work with Turbopack. There are currently some limitations:\n\n*   Only a core subset of the webpack loader API is implemented. Currently, there is enough coverage for some popular loaders, and we'll expand our API support in the future.\n*   Only loaders that return JavaScript code are supported. Loaders that transform files like stylesheets or images are not currently supported.\n*   Options passed to webpack loaders must be plain JavaScript primitives, objects, and arrays. For example, it's not possible to pass `require()`d plugin modules as option values.\n\nTo configure loaders, add the names of the loaders you've installed and any options in `next.config.js`, mapping file extensions to a list of loaders:\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  experimental: {\n    turbo: {\n      rules: {\n        '*.svg': {\n          loaders: ['@svgr/webpack'],\n          as: '*.js',\n        },\n      },\n    },\n  },\n}\n```\n\n> **Good to know**: Prior to Next.js version 13.4.4, `experimental.turbo.rules` was named `experimental.turbo.loaders` and only accepted file extensions like `.mdx` instead of `*.mdx`.\n\n### [Supported loaders](#supported-loaders)\n\nThe following loaders have been tested to work with Turbopack's webpack loader implementation:\n\n*   [`babel-loader`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-loader)\n*   [`@svgr/webpack`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@svgr/webpack)\n*   [`svg-inline-loader`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/svg-inline-loader)\n*   [`yaml-loader`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yaml-loader)\n*   [`string-replace-loader`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/string-replace-loader)\n*   [`raw-loader`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/raw-loader)\n*   ['sass-loader'](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sass-loader)\n\n## [Resolve aliases](#resolve-aliases)\n\nThrough `next.config.js`, Turbopack can be configured to modify module resolution through aliases, similar to webpack's [`resolve.alias`](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/resolve/#resolvealias) configuration.\n\nTo configure resolve aliases, map imported patterns to their new destination in `next.config.js`:\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  experimental: {\n    turbo: {\n      resolveAlias: {\n        underscore: 'lodash',\n        mocha: { browser: 'mocha/browser-entry.js' },\n      },\n    },\n  },\n}\n```\n\nThis aliases imports of the `underscore` package to the `lodash` package. In other words, `import underscore from 'underscore'` will load the `lodash` module instead of `underscore`.\n\nTurbopack also supports conditional aliasing through this field, similar to Node.js's [conditional exports](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v18.x/api/packages.html#conditional-exports). At the moment only the `browser` condition is supported. In the case above, imports of the `mocha` module will be aliased to `mocha/browser-entry.js` when Turbopack targets browser environments.\n\n## [Resolve extensions](#resolve-extensions)\n\nThrough `next.config.js`, Turbopack can be configured to resolve modules with custom extensions, similar to webpack's [`resolve.extensions`](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/resolve/#resolveextensions) configuration.\n\nTo configure resolve extensions, use the `resolveExtensions` field in `next.config.js`:\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  experimental: {\n    turbo: {\n      resolveExtensions: [\n        '.mdx',\n        '.tsx',\n        '.ts',\n        '.jsx',\n        '.js',\n        '.mjs',\n        '.json',\n      ],\n    },\n  },\n}\n```\n\nThis overwrites the original resolve extensions with the provided list. Make sure to include the default extensions.\n\nFor more information and guidance for how to migrate your app to Turbopack from webpack, see [Turbopack's documentation on webpack compatibility](https://turbo.build/pack/docs/migrating-from-webpack).",

    "markdown": "# API Reference: create-next-app | Next.js\n\nThe easiest way to get started with Next.js is by using `create-next-app`. This CLI tool enables you to quickly start building a new Next.js application, with everything set up for you.\n\nYou can create a new app using the default Next.js template, or by using one of the [official Next.js examples](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples).\n\n### [Interactive](#interactive)\n\nYou can create a new project interactively by running:\n\n```\nnpx create-next-app@latest\n```\n\nYou will then be asked the following prompts:\n\n```\nWhat is your project named?  my-app\nWould you like to use TypeScript?  No / Yes\nWould you like to use ESLint?  No / Yes\nWould you like to use Tailwind CSS?  No / Yes\nWould you like to use `src/` directory?  No / Yes\nWould you like to use App Router? (recommended)  No / Yes\nWould you like to customize the default import alias (@/*)?  No / Yes\n```\n\nOnce you've answered the prompts, a new project will be created with the correct configuration depending on your answers.\n\n### [Non-interactive](#non-interactive)\n\nYou can also pass command line arguments to set up a new project non-interactively.\n\nFurther, you can negate default options by prefixing them with `--no-` (e.g. `--no-eslint`).\n\nSee `create-next-app --help`:\n\n```\nUsage: create-next-app <project-directory> [options]\n \nOptions:\n  -V, --version                        output the version number\n  --ts, --typescript\n \n    Initialize as a TypeScript project.

You can use an example name\n    from the official Next.js repo or a public GitHub URL. The URL can use\n    any branch and/or subdirectory\n \n  --example-path <path-to-example>\n \n    In a rare case, your GitHub URL might contain a branch name with\n    a slash (e.g. bug/fix-1) and the path to the example (e.g. foo/bar).\n    In this case, you must specify the path to the example separately:\n    --example-path foo/bar\n \n  --reset-preferences\n \n    Explicitly tell the CLI to reset any stored preferences\n \n  -h, --help                           output usage information\n```\n\n### [Why use Create Next App?](#why-use-create-next-app)\n\n`create-next-app` allows you to create a new Next.js app within seconds. It is officially maintained by the creators of Next.js, and includes a number of benefits:\n\n*   **Interactive Experience**: Running `npx create-next-app@latest` (with no arguments) launches an interactive experience that guides you through setting up a project.\n*   **Zero Dependencies**: Initializing a project is as quick as one second. Create Next App has zero dependencies.\n*   **Offline Support**: Create Next App will automatically detect if you're offline and bootstrap your project using your local package cache.\n*   **Support for Examples**: Create Next App can bootstrap your application using an example from the Next.js examples collection (e.g. `npx create-next-app --example api-routes`) or any public GitHub repository.\n*   **Tested**: The package is part of the Next.js monorepo and tested using the same integration test suite as Next.js itself, ensuring it works as expected with every release.",

    "markdown": "# Routing: Custom Document | Next.js\n\nA custom `Document` can update the `<html>` and `<body>` tags used to render a [Page](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts).\n\nTo override the default `Document`, create the file `pages/_document` as shown below:\n\n```\nimport { Html, Head, Main, NextScript } from 'next/document'\n \nexport default function Document() {\n  return (\n    <Html lang=\"en\">\n      <Head />\n      <body>\n        <Main />\n        <NextScript />\n      </body>\n    </Html>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n> **Good to know**\n> \n> *   `_document` is only rendered on the server, so event handlers like `onClick` cannot be used in this file.\n> *   `<Html>`, `<Head />`, `<Main />` and `<NextScript />` are required for the page to be properly rendered.\n\n## [Caveats](#caveats)\n\n*   The `<Head />` component used in `_document` is not the same as [`next/head`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/components/head). The `<Head />` component used here should only be used for any `<head>` code that is common for all pages. For all other cases, such as `<title>` tags, we recommend using [`next/head`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/components/head) in your pages or components.\n*   React components outside of `<Main />` will not be initialized by the browser. Do _not_ add application logic here or custom CSS (like `styled-jsx`). If you need shared components in all your pages (like a menu or a toolbar), read [Layouts](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts#layout-pattern) instead.\n*   `Document` currently does not support Next.js [Data Fetching methods](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching) like [`getStaticProps`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-static-props) or [`getServerSideProps`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-server-side-props).\n\n## [Customizing `renderPage`](#customizing-renderpage)\n\nCustomizing `renderPage` is advanced and only needed for libraries like CSS-in-JS to support server-side rendering. This is not needed for built-in `styled-jsx` support.\n\n**We do not recommend using this pattern.** Instead, consider [incrementally adopting](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/upgrading/app-router-migration) the App Router, which allows you to more easily fetch data for [pages and layouts](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts).\n\n```\nimport Document, {\n  Html,\n  Head,\n  Main,\n  NextScript,\n  DocumentContext,\n  DocumentInitialProps,\n} from 'next/document'\n \nclass MyDocument extends Document {\n  static async getInitialProps(\n    ctx: DocumentContext\n  ): Promise<DocumentInitialProps> {\n    const originalRenderPage = ctx.renderPage\n \n    // Run the React rendering logic synchronously\n    ctx.renderPage = () =>\n      originalRenderPage({\n        // Useful for wrapping the whole react tree\n        enhanceApp: (App) => App,\n        // Useful for wrapping in a per-page basis\n        enhanceComponent: (Component) => Component,\n      })\n \n    // Run the parent `getInitialProps`, it now includes the custom `renderPage`\n    const initialProps = await Document.getInitialProps(ctx)\n \n    return initialProps\n  }\n \n  render() {\n    return (\n      <Html lang=\"en\">\n        <Head />\n        <body>\n          <Main />\n          <NextScript />\n        </body>\n      </Html>\n    )\n  }\n}\n \nexport default MyDocument\n```\n\n> **Good to know**\n> \n> *   `getInitialProps` in `_document` is not called during client-side transitions.\n> *   The `ctx` object for `_document` is equivalent to the one received in [`getInitialProps`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/get-initial-props#context-object), with the addition of `renderPage`.",

They are server-side only bundles and won't increase your client-side bundle size.\n\nFor example, the following API route returns a JSON response with a status code of `200`:\n\n```\nimport type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next'\n \ntype ResponseData = {\n  message: string\n}\n \nexport default function handler(\n  req: NextApiRequest,\n  res: NextApiResponse<ResponseData>\n) {\n  res.status(200).json({ message: 'Hello from Next.js!' })\n}\n```\n\n> **Good to know**:\n> \n> *   API Routes [do not specify CORS headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS), meaning they are **same-origin only** by default. You can customize such behavior by wrapping the request handler with the [CORS request helpers](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/api-routes-cors).\n\n*   API Routes can't be used with [static exports](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/deploying/static-exports). However, [Route Handlers](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-handlers) in the App Router can.\n    \n    > *   API Routes will be affected by [`pageExtensions` configuration](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/next-config-js/pageExtensions) in `next.config.js`.\n    \n\n## [Parameters](#parameters)\n\n```\nexport default function handler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n*   `req`: An instance of [http.IncomingMessage](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#class-httpincomingmessage)\n*   `res`: An instance of [http.ServerResponse](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#class-httpserverresponse)\n\n## [HTTP Methods](#http-methods)\n\nTo handle different HTTP methods in an API route, you can use `req.method` in your request handler, like so:\n\n```\nimport type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next'\n \nexport default function handler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {\n  if (req.method === 'POST') {\n    // Process a POST request\n  } else {\n    // Handle any other HTTP method\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## [Request Helpers](#request-helpers)\n\nAPI Routes provide built-in request helpers which parse the incoming request (`req`):\n\n*   `req.cookies` - An object containing the cookies sent by the request. Defaults to `{}`\n*   `req.query` - An object containing the [query string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string). Defaults to `{}`\n*   `req.body` - An object containing the body parsed by `content-type`, or `null` if no body was sent\n\n### [Custom config](#custom-config)\n\nEvery API Route can export a `config` object to change the default configuration, which is the following:\n\n```\nexport const config = {\n  api: {\n    bodyParser: {\n      sizeLimit: '1mb',\n    },\n  },\n  // Specifies the maximum allowed duration for this function to execute (in seconds)\n  maxDuration: 5,\n}\n```\n\n`bodyParser` is automatically enabled. If you want to consume the body as a `Stream` or with [`raw-body`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/raw-body), you can set this to `false`.\n\nOne use case for disabling the automatic `bodyParsing` is to allow you to verify the raw body of a **webhook** request, for example [from GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhooks/securing-your-webhooks#validating-payloads-from-github).\n\n```\nexport const config = {\n  api: {\n    bodyParser: false,\n  },\n}\n```\n\n`bodyParser.sizeLimit` is the maximum size allowed for the parsed body, in any format supported by [bytes](https://github.com/visionmedia/bytes.js), like so:\n\n```\nexport const config = {\n  api: {\n    bodyParser: {\n      sizeLimit: '500kb',\n    },\n  },\n}\n```\n\n`externalResolver` is an explicit flag that tells the server that this route is being handled by an external resolver like _express_ or _connect_. Enabling this option disables warnings for unresolved requests.\n\n```\nexport const config = {\n  api: {\n    externalResolver: true,\n  },\n}\n```\n\n`responseLimit` is automatically enabled, warning when an API Routes' response body is over 4MB.\n\nIf you are not using Next.js in a serverless environment, and understand the performance implications of not using a CDN or dedicated media host, you can set this limit to `false`.\n\n```\nexport const config = {\n  api: {\n    responseLimit: false,\n  },\n}\n```\n\n`responseLimit` can also take the number of bytes or any string format supported by `bytes`, for example `1000`, `'500kb'` or `'3mb'`. This value will be the maximum response size before a warning is displayed. Default is 4MB. (see above)\n\n```\nexport const config = {\n  api: {\n    responseLimit: '8mb',\n  },\n}\n```\n\n## [Response Helpers](#response-helpers)\n\nThe [Server Response object](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_serverresponse), (often abbreviated as `res`) includes a set of Express.js-like helper methods to improve the developer experience and increase the speed of creating new API endpoints.\n\nThe included helpers are:\n\n*   `res.status(code)` - A function to set the status code. `code` must be a valid [HTTP status code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes)\n*   `res.json(body)` - Sends a JSON response. `body` must be a [serializable object](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Glossary/Serialization)\n*   `res.send(body)` - Sends the HTTP response. `body` can be a `string`, an `object` or a `Buffer`\n*   `res.redirect([status,] path)` - Redirects to a specified path or URL. `status` must be a valid [HTTP status code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes). If not specified, `status` defaults to \"307\" \"Temporary redirect\".\n*   `res.revalidate(urlPath)` - [Revalidate a page on demand](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/incremental-static-regeneration#on-demand-revalidation) using `getStaticProps`. `urlPath` must be a `string`.\n\n### [Setting the status code of a response](#setting-the-status-code-of-a-response)\n\nWhen sending a response back to the client, you can set the status code of the response.\n\nThe following example sets the status code of the response to `200` (`OK`) and returns a `message` property with the value of `Hello from Next.js!` as a JSON response:\n\n```\nimport type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next'\n \ntype ResponseData = {\n  message: string\n}\n \nexport default function handler(\n  req: NextApiRequest,\n  res: NextApiResponse<ResponseData>\n) {\n  res.status(200).json({ message: 'Hello from Next.js!' })\n}\n```\n\n### [Sending a JSON response](#sending-a-json-response)\n\nWhen sending a response back to the client you can send a JSON response, this must be a [serializable object](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Glossary/Serialization). In a real world application you might want to let the client know the status of the request depending on the result of the requested endpoint.\n\nThe following example sends a JSON response with the status code `200` (`OK`) and the result of the async operation. It's contained in a try catch block to handle any errors that may occur, with the appropriate status code and error message caught and sent back to the client:\n\n```\nimport type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next'\n \nexport default async function handler(\n  req: NextApiRequest,\n  res: NextApiResponse\n) {\n  try {\n    const result = await someAsyncOperation()\n    res.status(200).json({ result })\n  } catch (err) {\n    res.status(500).json({ error: 'failed to load data' })\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### [Sending a HTTP response](#sending-a-http-response)\n\nSending an HTTP response works the same way as when sending a JSON response. The only difference is that the response body can be a `string`, an `object` or a `Buffer`.\n\nThe following example sends a HTTP response with the status code `200` (`OK`) and the result of the async operation.\n\n```\nimport type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next'\n \nexport default async function handler(\n  req: NextApiRequest,\n  res: NextApiResponse\n) {\n  try {\n    const result = await someAsyncOperation()\n    res.status(200).send({ result })\n  } catch (err) {\n    res.status(500).send({ error: 'failed to fetch data' })\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### [Redirects to a specified path or URL](#redirects-to-a-specified-path-or-url)\n\nTaking a form as an example, you may want to redirect your client to a specified path or URL once they have submitted the form.\n\nThe following example redirects the client to the `/` path if the form is successfully submitted:\n\n```\nimport type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next'\n \nexport default async function handler(\n  req: NextApiRequest,\n  res: NextApiResponse\n) {\n  const { name, message } = req.body\n \n  try {\n    await handleFormInputAsync({ name, message })\n    res.redirect(307, '/')\n  } catch (err) {\n    res.status(500).send({ error: 'Failed to fetch data' })\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### [Adding TypeScript types](#adding-typescript-types)\n\nYou can make your API Routes more type-safe by importing the `NextApiRequest` and `NextApiResponse` types from `next`, in addition to those, you can also type your response data:\n\n```\nimport type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next'\n \ntype ResponseData = {\n  message: string\n}\n \nexport default function handler(\n  req: NextApiRequest,\n  res: NextApiResponse<ResponseData>\n) {\n  res.status(200).json({ message: 'Hello from Next.js!' })\n}\n```\n\n> **Good to know**: The body of `NextApiRequest` is `any` because the client may include any payload. You should validate the type/shape of the body at runtime before using it.\n\n## [Dynamic API Routes](#dynamic-api-routes)\n\nAPI Routes support [dynamic routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes), and follow the same file naming rules used for `pages/`.\n\n```\nimport type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next'\n \nexport default function handler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {\n  const { pid } = req.query\n  res.end(`Post: ${pid}`)\n}\n```\n\nNow, a request to `/api/post/abc` will respond with the text: `Post: abc`.\n\n### [Catch all API routes](#catch-all-api-routes)\n\nAPI Routes can be extended to catch all paths by adding three dots (`...`) inside the brackets. For example:\n\n*   `pages/api/post/[...slug].js` matches `/api/post/a`, but also `/api/post/a/b`, `/api/post/a/b/c` and so on.\n\n> **Good to know**: You can use names other than `slug`, such as: `[...param]`\n\nMatched parameters will be sent as a query parameter (`slug` in the example) to the page, and it will always be an array, so, the path `/api/post/a` will have the following `query` object:\n\nAnd in the case of `/api/post/a/b`, and any other matching path, new parameters will be added to the array, like so:\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nimport type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next'\n \nexport default function handler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {\n  const { slug } = req.query\n  res.end(`Post: ${slug.join(', ')}`)\n}\n```\n\nNow, a request to `/api/post/a/b/c` will respond with the text: `Post: a, b, c`.\n\n### [Optional catch all API routes](#optional-catch-all-api-routes)\n\nCatch all routes can be made optional by including the parameter in double brackets (`[[...slug]]`).\n\nFor example, `pages/api/post/[[...slug]].js` will match `/api/post`, `/api/post/a`, `/api/post/a/b`, and so on.\n\nThe main difference between catch all and optional catch all routes is that with optional, the route without the parameter is also matched (`/api/post` in the example above).\n\nThe `query` objects are as follows:\n\n```\n{ } // GET `/api/post` (empty object)\n{ \"slug\": [\"a\"] } // `GET /api/post/a` (single-element array)\n{ \"slug\": [\"a\", \"b\"] } // `GET /api/post/a/b` (multi-element array)\n```\n\n### [Caveats](#caveats)\n\n*   Predefined API routes take precedence over dynamic API routes, and dynamic API routes over catch all API routes. Take a look at the following examples:\n    *   `pages/api/post/create.js` - Will match `/api/post/create`\n    *   `pages/api/post/[pid].js` - Will match `/api/post/1`, `/api/post/abc`, etc. But not `/api/post/create`\n    *   `pages/api/post/[...slug].js` - Will match `/api/post/1/2`, `/api/post/a/b/c`, etc. But not `/api/post/create`, `/api/post/abc`\n\n## [Edge API Routes](#edge-api-routes)\n\nIf you would like to use API Routes with the Edge Runtime, we recommend incrementally adopting the App Router and using [Route Handlers](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-handlers) instead.\n\nThe Route Handlers function signature is isomorphic, meaning you can use the same function for both Edge and Node.js runtimes.",

This allows you to distinguish between client and server configuration using the `isServer` property.\n\nThe second argument to the `webpack` function is an object with the following properties:\n\n*   `buildId`: `String` - The build id, used as a unique identifier between builds\n*   `dev`: `Boolean` - Indicates if the compilation will be done in development\n*   `isServer`: `Boolean` - It's `true` for server-side compilation, and `false` for client-side compilation\n*   `nextRuntime`: `String | undefined` - The target runtime for server-side compilation; either `\"edge\"` or `\"nodejs\"`, it's `undefined` for client-side compilation.\n*   `defaultLoaders`: `Object` - Default loaders used internally by Next.js:\n    *   `babel`: `Object` - Default `babel-loader` configuration\n\nExample usage of `defaultLoaders.babel`:\n\n```\n// Example config for adding a loader that depends on babel-loader\n// This source was taken from the @next/mdx plugin source:\n// https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/next-mdx\nmodule.exports = {\n  webpack: (config, options) => {\n    config.module.rules.push({\n      test: /\\.mdx/,\n      use: [\n        options.defaultLoaders.babel,\n        {\n          loader: '@mdx-js/loader',\n          options: pluginOptions.options,\n        },\n      ],\n    })\n \n    return config\n  },\n}\n```\n\n#### [`nextRuntime`](#nextruntime)\n\nNotice that `isServer` is `true` when `nextRuntime` is `\"edge\"` or `\"nodejs\"`, nextRuntime \"`edge`\" is currently for middleware and Server Components in edge runtime only.",

The default port can be changed with `-p`, like so:\n\nOr using the `PORT` environment variable:\n\n> **Good to know**:\n> \n> *   `PORT` cannot be set in `.env` as booting up the HTTP server happens before any other code is initialized.\n> *   Next.js will automatically retry with another port until a port is available if a port is not specified with the CLI option `--port` or the `PORT` environment variable.\n\nYou can also set the hostname to be different from the default of `0.0.0.0`, this can be useful for making the application available for other devices on the network. The default hostname can be changed with `-H`, like so:\n\n### [Turbopack](#turbopack)\n\n[Turbopack](https://nextjs.org/docs/architecture/turbopack) (beta), our new bundler, which is being tested and stabilized in Next.js, helps speed up local iterations while working on your application.\n\nTo use Turbopack in development mode, add the `--turbo` option:\n\n### [HTTPS for Local Development](#https-for-local-development)\n\nFor certain use cases like webhooks or authentication, it may be required to use HTTPS to have a secure environment on `localhost`. Next.js can generate a self-signed certificate with `next dev` as follows:\n\n```\nnext dev --experimental-https\n```\n\nYou can also provide a custom certificate and key with `--experimental-https-key` and `--experimental-https-cert`. Optionally, you can provide a custom CA certificate with `--experimental-https-ca` as well.\n\n```\nnext dev --experimental-https --experimental-https-key ./certificates/localhost-key.pem --experimental-https-cert ./certificates/localhost.pem\n```\n\n`next dev --experimental-https` is only intended for development and creates a locally-trusted certificate with `mkcert`. In production, use properly issued certificates from trusted authorities. When deploying to Vercel, HTTPS is [automatically configured](https://vercel.com/docs/security/encryption) for your Next.js application.\n\n## [Build](#build)\n\n`next build` creates an optimized production build of your application. The output displays information about each route:\n\n```\nRoute (app)                               Size     First Load JS\n┌ ○ /                                     5.3 kB         89.5 kB\n├ ○ /_not-found                           885 B          85.1 kB\n└ ○ /about                                137 B          84.4 kB\n+ First Load JS shared by all             84.2 kB\n  ├ chunks/184-d3bb186aac44da98.js        28.9 kB\n  ├ chunks/30b509c0-f3503c24f98f3936.js   53.4 kB\n  └ other shared chunks (total)\n \n \n○  (Static)  prerendered as static content\n```\n\n*   **Size**: The number of assets downloaded when navigating to the page client-side. The size for each route only includes its dependencies.\n*   **First Load JS**: The number of assets downloaded when visiting the page from the server. The amount of JS shared by all is shown as a separate metric.\n\nBoth of these values are [**compressed with gzip**](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/compress). The first load is indicated by green, yellow, or red. Aim for green for performant applications.\n\nTo get a list of the available options with `next build`, run the following command inside your project directory:\n\nThe output should look like this:\n\n```\nUsage: next build [directory] [options]\n \nCreates an optimized production build of your application.

The application should be compiled with [`next build`](#build) first.\n\nTo get a list of the available options with `next start`, run the follow command inside your project directory:\n\nThe output should look like this:\n\n```\nUsage: next start [directory] [options]\n \nStarts Next.js in production mode. The application should be compiled with `next build`\nfirst.\n \nArguments:\n  [directory]                           A directory on which to start the application.\n                                        If not directory is provided, the current\n                                        directory will be used.\n \nOptions:\n  -p, --port <port>                     Specify a port number on which to start the\n                                        application.

The default port can be changed with `-p`, like so:\n\nOr using the `PORT` environment variable:\n\n> **Good to know**:\n> \n> *   `PORT` cannot be set in `.env` as booting up the HTTP server happens before any other code is initialized.\n> *   `next start` cannot be used with `output: 'standalone'` or `output: 'export'`.\n\n### [Keep Alive Timeout](#keep-alive-timeout)\n\nWhen deploying Next.js behind a downstream proxy (e.g. a load-balancer like AWS ELB/ALB) it's important to configure Next's underlying HTTP server with [keep-alive timeouts](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_server_keepalivetimeout) that are _larger_ than the downstream proxy's timeouts. Otherwise, once a keep-alive timeout is reached for a given TCP connection, Node.js will immediately terminate that connection without notifying the downstream proxy. This results in a proxy error whenever it attempts to reuse a connection that Node.js has already terminated.\n\nTo configure the timeout values for the production Next.js server, pass `--keepAliveTimeout` (in milliseconds) to `next start`, like so:\n\n```\nnext start --keepAliveTimeout 70000\n```\n\n## [Info](#info)\n\n`next info` prints relevant details about the current system which can be used to report Next.js bugs.

The guides in **Building Your Application** explain how to use these features and how to customize your application's behavior.\n\nThe sections and pages are organized sequentially, from basic to advanced, so you can follow them step-by-step when building your Next.js application. However, you can read them in any order or skip to the pages that apply to your use case.\n\nIf you're new to Next.js, we recommend starting with the [Routing](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing), [Rendering](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/rendering), [Data Fetching](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching) and [Styling](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/styling) sections, as they introduce the fundamental Next.js and web concepts to help you get started.

    "markdown": "# next.config.js Options: webVitalsAttribution | Next.js\n\nWhen debugging issues related to Web Vitals, it is often helpful if we can pinpoint the source of the problem. For example, in the case of Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS), we might want to know the first element that shifted when the single largest layout shift occurred. Or, in the case of Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), we might want to identify the element corresponding to the LCP for the page. If the LCP element is an image, knowing the URL of the image resource can help us locate the asset we need to optimize.\n\nPinpointing the biggest contributor to the Web Vitals score, aka [attribution](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/web-vitals/blob/4ca38ae64b8d1e899028c692f94d4c56acfc996c/README.md#attribution), allows us to obtain more in-depth information like entries for [PerformanceEventTiming](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/PerformanceEventTiming), [PerformanceNavigationTiming](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/PerformanceNavigationTiming) and [PerformanceResourceTiming](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/PerformanceResourceTiming).\n\nAttribution is disabled by default in Next.js but can be enabled **per metric** by specifying the following in `next.config.js`.\n\n```\nexperimental: {\n  webVitalsAttribution: ['CLS', 'LCP']\n}\n```\n\nValid attribution values are all `web-vitals` metrics specified in the [`NextWebVitalsMetric`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/442378d21dd56d6e769863eb8c2cb521a463a2e0/packages/next/shared/lib/utils.ts#L43) type.",

    "markdown": "# Routing: Custom Errors | Next.js\n\n## [404 Page](#404-page)\n\nA 404 page may be accessed very often. Server-rendering an error page for every visit increases the load of the Next.js server. This can result in increased costs and slow experiences.\n\nTo avoid the above pitfalls, Next.js provides a static 404 page by default without having to add any additional files.\n\n### [Customizing The 404 Page](#customizing-the-404-page)\n\nTo create a custom 404 page you can create a `pages/404.js` file. This file is statically generated at build time.\n\n```\nexport default function Custom404() {\n  return <h1>404 - Page Not Found</h1>\n}\n```\n\n> **Good to know**: You can use [`getStaticProps`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-static-props) inside this page if you need to fetch data at build time.\n\n## [500 Page](#500-page)\n\nServer-rendering an error page for every visit adds complexity to responding to errors. To help users get responses to errors as fast as possible, Next.js provides a static 500 page by default without having to add any additional files.\n\n### [Customizing The 500 Page](#customizing-the-500-page)\n\nTo customize the 500 page you can create a `pages/500.js` file. This file is statically generated at build time.\n\n```\nexport default function Custom500() {\n  return <h1>500 - Server-side error occurred</h1>\n}\n```\n\n> **Good to know**: You can use [`getStaticProps`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-static-props) inside this page if you need to fetch data at build time.\n\n### [More Advanced Error Page Customizing](#more-advanced-error-page-customizing)\n\n500 errors are handled both client-side and server-side by the `Error` component. If you wish to override it, define the file `pages/_error.js` and add the following code:\n\n```\nfunction Error({ statusCode }) {\n  return (\n    <p>\n      {statusCode\n        ? `An error ${statusCode} occurred on server`\n        : 'An error occurred on client'}\n    </p>\n  )\n}\n \nError.getInitialProps = ({ res, err }) => {\n  const statusCode = res ? res.statusCode : err ? err.statusCode : 404\n  return { statusCode }\n}\n \nexport default Error\n```\n\n> `pages/_error.js` is only used in production. In development you’ll get an error with the call stack to know where the error originated from.\n\n### [Reusing the built-in error page](#reusing-the-built-in-error-page)\n\nIf you want to render the built-in error page you can by importing the `Error` component:\n\n```\nimport Error from 'next/error'\n \nexport async function getServerSideProps() {\n  const res = await fetch('https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js')\n  const errorCode = res.ok ? false : res.status\n  const json = await res.json()\n \n  return {\n    props: { errorCode, stars: json.stargazers_count },\n  }\n}\n \nexport default function Page({ errorCode, stars }) {\n  if (errorCode) {\n    return <Error statusCode={errorCode} />\n  }\n \n  return <div>Next stars: {stars}</div>\n}\n```\n\nThe `Error` component also takes `title` as a property if you want to pass in a text message along with a `statusCode`.\n\nIf you have a custom `Error` component be sure to import that one instead. `next/error` exports the default component used by Next.js.\n\n### [Caveats](#caveats)\n\n*   `Error` does not currently support Next.js [Data Fetching methods](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching) like [`getStaticProps`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-static-props) or [`getServerSideProps`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-server-side-props).\n*   `_error`, like `_app`, is a reserved pathname. `_error` is used to define the customized layouts and behaviors of the error pages. `/_error` will render 404 when accessed directly via [routing](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing) or rendering in a [custom server](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/custom-server).",

To start, we added an experimental flag forcing you to explicitly allow the domains you accept URL imports from. We're working to take this further by limiting URL imports to execute in the browser sandbox using the [Edge Runtime](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/edge).\n\n## [Lockfile](#lockfile)\n\nWhen using URL imports, Next.js will create a `next.lock` directory containing a lockfile and fetched assets. This directory **must be committed to Git**, not ignored by `.gitignore`.\n\n*   When running `next dev`, Next.js will download and add all newly discovered URL Imports to your lockfile\n*   When running `next build`, Next.js will use only the lockfile to build the application for production\n\nTypically, no network requests are needed and any outdated lockfile will cause the build to fail. One exception is resources that respond with `Cache-Control: no-cache`. These resources will have a `no-cache` entry in the lockfile and will always be fetched from the network on each build.\n\n## [Examples](#examples)\n\n### [Skypack](#skypack)\n\n```\nimport confetti from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/canvas-confetti'\nimport { useEffect } from 'react'\n \nexport default () => {\n  useEffect(() => {\n    confetti()\n  })\n  return <p>Hello</p>\n}\n```\n\n### [Static Image Imports](#static-image-imports)\n\n```\nimport Image from 'next/image'\nimport logo from 'https://example.com/assets/logo.png'\n \nexport default () => (\n  <div>\n    <Image src={logo} placeholder=\"blur\" />\n  </div>\n)\n```\n\n### [URLs in CSS](#urls-in-css)\n\n```\n.className {\n  background: url('https://example.com/assets/hero.jpg');\n}\n```\n\n### [Asset Imports](#asset-imports)\n\n```\nconst logo = new URL('https://example.com/assets/file.txt', import.meta.url)\n \nconsole.log(logo.pathname)\n \n// prints \"/_next/static/media/file.a9727b5d.txt\"\n```",

    "markdown": "# Routing: Internationalization | Next.js\n\nExamples\n\n*   [i18n routing](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/i18n-routing)\n\nNext.js has built-in support for internationalized ([i18n](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization#Naming)) routing since `v10.0.0`. You can provide a list of locales, the default locale, and domain-specific locales and Next.js will automatically handle the routing.\n\nThe i18n routing support is currently meant to complement existing i18n library solutions like [`react-intl`](https://formatjs.io/docs/getting-started/installation), [`react-i18next`](https://react.i18next.com/), [`lingui`](https://lingui.dev/), [`rosetta`](https://github.com/lukeed/rosetta), [`next-intl`](https://github.com/amannn/next-intl), [`next-translate`](https://github.com/aralroca/next-translate), [`next-multilingual`](https://github.com/Avansai/next-multilingual), [`tolgee`](https://tolgee.io/integrations/next), and others by streamlining the routes and locale parsing.\n\n## [Getting started](#getting-started)\n\nTo get started, add the `i18n` config to your `next.config.js` file.\n\nLocales are [UTS Locale Identifiers](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35-59/tr35.html#Identifiers), a standardized format for defining locales.\n\nGenerally a Locale Identifier is made up of a language, region, and script separated by a dash: `language-region-script`. The region and script are optional. An example:\n\n*   `en-US` - English as spoken in the United States\n*   `nl-NL` - Dutch as spoken in the Netherlands\n*   `nl` - Dutch, no specific region\n\nIf user locale is `nl-BE` and it is not listed in your configuration, they will be redirected to `nl` if available, or to the default locale otherwise. If you don't plan to support all regions of a country, it is therefore a good practice to include country locales that will act as fallbacks.\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  i18n: {\n    // These are all the locales you want to support in\n    // your application\n    locales: ['en-US', 'fr', 'nl-NL'],\n    // This is the default locale you want to be used when visiting\n    // a non-locale prefixed path e.g. `/hello`\n    defaultLocale: 'en-US',\n    // This is a list of locale domains and the default locale they\n    // should handle (these are only required when setting up domain routing)\n    // Note: subdomains must be included in the domain value to be matched e.g. \"fr.example.com\".\n    domains: [\n      {\n        domain: 'example.com',\n        defaultLocale: 'en-US',\n      },\n      {\n        domain: 'example.nl',\n        defaultLocale: 'nl-NL',\n      },\n      {\n        domain: 'example.fr',\n        defaultLocale: 'fr',\n        // an optional http field can also be used to test\n        // locale domains locally with http instead of https\n        http: true,\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n}\n```\n\n## [Locale Strategies](#locale-strategies)\n\nThere are two locale handling strategies: Sub-path Routing and Domain Routing.\n\n### [Sub-path Routing](#sub-path-routing)\n\nSub-path Routing puts the locale in the url path.\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  i18n: {\n    locales: ['en-US', 'fr', 'nl-NL'],\n    defaultLocale: 'en-US',\n  },\n}\n```\n\nWith the above configuration `en-US`, `fr`, and `nl-NL` will be available to be routed to, and `en-US` is the default locale. If you have a `pages/blog.js` the following urls would be available:\n\n*   `/blog`\n*   `/fr/blog`\n*   `/nl-nl/blog`\n\nThe default locale does not have a prefix.\n\n### [Domain Routing](#domain-routing)\n\nBy using domain routing you can configure locales to be served from different domains:\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  i18n: {\n    locales: ['en-US', 'fr', 'nl-NL', 'nl-BE'],\n    defaultLocale: 'en-US',\n \n    domains: [\n      {\n        // Note: subdomains must be included in the domain value to be matched\n        // e.g. www.example.com should be used if that is the expected hostname\n        domain: 'example.com',\n        defaultLocale: 'en-US',\n      },\n      {\n        domain: 'example.fr',\n        defaultLocale: 'fr',\n      },\n      {\n        domain: 'example.nl',\n        defaultLocale: 'nl-NL',\n        // specify other locales that should be redirected\n        // to this domain\n        locales: ['nl-BE'],\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n}\n```\n\nFor example if you have `pages/blog.js` the following urls will be available:\n\n*   `example.com/blog`\n*   `www.example.com/blog`\n*   `example.fr/blog`\n*   `example.nl/blog`\n*   `example.nl/nl-BE/blog`\n\n## [Automatic Locale Detection](#automatic-locale-detection)\n\nWhen a user visits the application root (generally `/`), Next.js will try to automatically detect which locale the user prefers based on the [`Accept-Language`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept-Language) header and the current domain.\n\nIf a locale other than the default locale is detected, the user will be redirected to either:\n\n*   **When using Sub-path Routing:** The locale prefixed path\n*   **When using Domain Routing:** The domain with that locale specified as the default\n\nWhen using Domain Routing, if a user with the `Accept-Language` header `fr;q=0.9` visits `example.com`, they will be redirected to `example.fr` since that domain handles the `fr` locale by default.\n\nWhen using Sub-path Routing, the user would be redirected to `/fr`.\n\n### [Prefixing the Default Locale](#prefixing-the-default-locale)\n\nWith Next.js 12 and [Middleware](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/middleware), we can add a prefix to the default locale with a [workaround](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/18419).\n\nFor example, here's a `next.config.js` file with support for a few languages. Note the `\"default\"` locale has been added intentionally.\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  i18n: {\n    locales: ['default', 'en', 'de', 'fr'],\n    defaultLocale: 'default',\n    localeDetection: false,\n  },\n  trailingSlash: true,\n}\n```\n\nNext, we can use [Middleware](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/middleware) to add custom routing rules:\n\n```\nimport { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n \nconst PUBLIC_FILE = /\\.(.*)$/\n \nexport async function middleware(req: NextRequest) {\n  if (\n    req.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith('/_next') ||\n    req.nextUrl.pathname.includes('/api/') ||\n    PUBLIC_FILE.test(req.nextUrl.pathname)\n  ) {\n    return\n  }\n \n  if (req.nextUrl.locale === 'default') {\n    const locale = req.cookies.get('NEXT_LOCALE')?.value || 'en'\n \n    return NextResponse.redirect(\n      new URL(`/${locale}${req.nextUrl.pathname}${req.nextUrl.search}`, req.url)\n    )\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis [Middleware](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/middleware) skips adding the default prefix to [API Routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) and [public](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/static-assets) files like fonts or images. If a request is made to the default locale, we redirect to our prefix `/en`.\n\n### [Disabling Automatic Locale Detection](#disabling-automatic-locale-detection)\n\nThe automatic locale detection can be disabled with:\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  i18n: {\n    localeDetection: false,\n  },\n}\n```\n\nWhen `localeDetection` is set to `false` Next.js will no longer automatically redirect based on the user's preferred locale and will only provide locale information detected from either the locale based domain or locale path as described above.\n\n## [Accessing the locale information](#accessing-the-locale-information)\n\nYou can access the locale information via the Next.js router. For example, using the [`useRouter()`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/use-router) hook the following properties are available:\n\n*   `locale` contains the currently active locale.\n*   `locales` contains all configured locales.\n*   `defaultLocale` contains the configured default locale.\n\nWhen [pre-rendering](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/rendering/static-site-generation) pages with `getStaticProps` or `getServerSideProps`, the locale information is provided in [the context](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-static-props) provided to the function.\n\nWhen leveraging `getStaticPaths`, the configured locales are provided in the context parameter of the function under `locales` and the configured defaultLocale under `defaultLocale`.\n\n## [Transition between locales](#transition-between-locales)\n\nYou can use `next/link` or `next/router` to transition between locales.\n\nFor `next/link`, a `locale` prop can be provided to transition to a different locale from the currently active one. If no `locale` prop is provided, the currently active `locale` is used during client-transitions. For example:\n\n```\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n \nexport default function IndexPage(props) {\n  return (\n    <Link href=\"/another\" locale=\"fr\">\n      To /fr/another\n    </Link>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nWhen using the `next/router` methods directly, you can specify the `locale` that should be used via the transition options. For example:\n\n```\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/router'\n \nexport default function IndexPage(props) {\n  const router = useRouter()\n \n  return (\n    <div\n      onClick={() => {\n        router.push('/another', '/another', { locale: 'fr' })\n      }}\n    >\n      to /fr/another\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nNote that to handle switching only the `locale` while preserving all routing information such as [dynamic route](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes) query values or hidden href query values, you can provide the `href` parameter as an object:\n\n```\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/router'\nconst router = useRouter()\nconst { pathname, asPath, query } = router\n// change just the locale and maintain all other route information including href's query\nrouter.push({ pathname, query }, asPath, { locale: nextLocale })\n```\n\nSee [here](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/use-router#with-url-object) for more information on the object structure for `router.push`.\n\nIf you have a `href` that already includes the locale you can opt-out of automatically handling the locale prefixing:\n\n```\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n \nexport default function IndexPage(props) {\n  return (\n    <Link href=\"/fr/another\" locale={false}>\n      To /fr/another\n    </Link>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n## [Leveraging the `NEXT_LOCALE` cookie](#leveraging-the-next_locale-cookie)\n\nNext.js supports overriding the accept-language header with a `NEXT_LOCALE=the-locale` cookie. This cookie can be set using a language switcher and then when a user comes back to the site it will leverage the locale specified in the cookie when redirecting from `/` to the correct locale location.\n\nFor example, if a user prefers the locale `fr` in their accept-language header but a `NEXT_LOCALE=en` cookie is set the `en` locale when visiting `/` the user will be redirected to the `en` locale location until the cookie is removed or expired.\n\n## [Search Engine Optimization](#search-engine-optimization)\n\nSince Next.js knows what language the user is visiting it will automatically add the `lang` attribute to the `<html>` tag.\n\nNext.js doesn't know about variants of a page so it's up to you to add the `hreflang` meta tags using [`next/head`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/components/head). You can learn more about `hreflang` in the [Google Webmasters documentation](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/189077).\n\n## [How does this work with Static Generation?](#how-does-this-work-with-static-generation)\n\n> Note that Internationalized Routing does not integrate with [`output: 'export'`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/deploying/static-exports) as it does not leverage the Next.js routing layer. Hybrid Next.js applications that do not use `output: 'export'` are fully supported.\n\n### [Dynamic Routes and `getStaticProps` Pages](#dynamic-routes-and-getstaticprops-pages)\n\nFor pages using `getStaticProps` with [Dynamic Routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes), all locale variants of the page desired to be prerendered need to be returned from [`getStaticPaths`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-static-paths). Along with the `params` object returned for `paths`, you can also return a `locale` field specifying which locale you want to render. For example:\n\n```\nexport const getStaticPaths = ({ locales }) => {\n  return {\n    paths: [\n      // if no `locale` is provided only the defaultLocale will be generated\n      { params: { slug: 'post-1' }, locale: 'en-US' },\n      { params: { slug: 'post-1' }, locale: 'fr' },\n    ],\n    fallback: true,\n  }\n}\n```\n\nFor [Automatically Statically Optimized](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/rendering/automatic-static-optimization) and non-dynamic `getStaticProps` pages, **a version of the page will be generated for each locale**. This is important to consider because it can increase build times depending on how many locales are configured inside `getStaticProps`.\n\nFor example, if you have 50 locales configured with 10 non-dynamic pages using `getStaticProps`, this means `getStaticProps` will be called 500 times. 50 versions of the 10 pages will be generated during each build.\n\nTo decrease the build time of dynamic pages with `getStaticProps`, use a [`fallback` mode](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/get-static-paths#fallback-true). This allows you to return only the most popular paths and locales from `getStaticPaths` for prerendering during the build. Then, Next.js will build the remaining pages at runtime as they are requested.\n\n### [Automatically Statically Optimized Pages](#automatically-statically-optimized-pages)\n\nFor pages that are [automatically statically optimized](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/rendering/automatic-static-optimization), a version of the page will be generated for each locale.\n\n### [Non-dynamic getStaticProps Pages](#non-dynamic-getstaticprops-pages)\n\nFor non-dynamic `getStaticProps` pages, a version is generated for each locale like above. `getStaticProps` is called with each `locale` that is being rendered. If you would like to opt-out of a certain locale from being pre-rendered, you can return `notFound: true` from `getStaticProps` and this variant of the page will not be generated.\n\n```\nexport async function getStaticProps({ locale }) {\n  // Call an external API endpoint to get posts.\n  // You can use any data fetching library\n  const res = await fetch(`https://.../posts?locale=${locale}`)\n  const posts = await res.json()\n \n  if (posts.length === 0) {\n    return {\n      notFound: true,\n    }\n  }\n \n  // By returning { props: posts }, the Blog component\n  // will receive `posts` as a prop at build time\n  return {\n    props: {\n      posts,\n    },\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## [Limits for the i18n config](#limits-for-the-i18n-config)\n\n*   `locales`: 100 total locales\n*   `domains`: 100 total locale domain items\n\n> **Good to know**: These limits have been added initially to prevent potential [performance issues at build time](#dynamic-routes-and-getstaticprops-pages). You can workaround these limits with custom routing using [Middleware](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/middleware) in Next.js 12.",

    "markdown": "# Building Your Application: Rendering | Next.js\n\nBy default, Next.js **pre-renders** every page. This means that Next.js generates HTML for each page in advance, instead of having it all done by client-side JavaScript. Pre-rendering can result in better performance and SEO.\n\nEach generated HTML is associated with minimal JavaScript code necessary for that page. When a page is loaded by the browser, its JavaScript code runs and makes the page fully interactive (this process is called [hydration](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/client/hydrateRoot) in React).\n\n### [Pre-rendering](#pre-rendering)\n\nNext.js has two forms of pre-rendering: **Static Generation** and **Server-side Rendering**. The difference is in **when** it generates the HTML for a page.\n\n*   Static Generation: The HTML is generated at **build time** and will be reused on each request.\n*   Server-side Rendering: The HTML is generated on **each request**.\n\nImportantly, Next.js lets you choose which pre-rendering form you'd like to use for each page. You can create a \"hybrid\" Next.js app by using Static Generation for most pages and using Server-side Rendering for others.\n\nWe recommend using Static Generation over Server-side Rendering for performance reasons. Statically generated pages can be cached by CDN with no extra configuration to boost performance. However, in some cases, Server-side Rendering might be the only option.\n\nYou can also use client-side data fetching along with Static Generation or Server-side Rendering. That means some parts of a page can be rendered entirely by clientside JavaScript. To learn more, take a look at the [Data Fetching](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/client-side) documentation.",

    "markdown": "# Routing: Dynamic Routes | Next.js\n\nWhen you don't know the exact segment names ahead of time and want to create routes from dynamic data, you can use Dynamic Segments that are filled in at request time or [prerendered](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-static-paths) at build time.\n\n## [Convention](#convention)\n\nA Dynamic Segment can be created by wrapping a file or folder name in square brackets: `[segmentName]`. For example, `[id]` or `[slug]`.\n\nDynamic Segments can be accessed from [`useRouter`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/use-router).\n\n## [Example](#example)\n\nFor example, a blog could include the following route `pages/blog/[slug].js` where `[slug]` is the Dynamic Segment for blog posts.\n\n```\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/router'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  const router = useRouter()\n  return <p>Post: {router.query.slug}</p>\n}\n```\n\n| Route | Example URL | `params` |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `pages/blog/[slug].js` | `/blog/a` | `{ slug: 'a' }` |\n| `pages/blog/[slug].js` | `/blog/b` | `{ slug: 'b' }` |\n| `pages/blog/[slug].js` | `/blog/c` | `{ slug: 'c' }` |\n\n## [Catch-all Segments](#catch-all-segments)\n\nDynamic Segments can be extended to **catch-all** subsequent segments by adding an ellipsis inside the brackets `[...segmentName]`.\n\nFor example, `pages/shop/[...slug].js` will match `/shop/clothes`, but also `/shop/clothes/tops`, `/shop/clothes/tops/t-shirts`, and so on.\n\n| Route | Example URL | `params` |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `pages/shop/[...slug].js` | `/shop/a` | `{ slug: ['a'] }` |\n| `pages/shop/[...slug].js` | `/shop/a/b` | `{ slug: ['a', 'b'] }` |\n| `pages/shop/[...slug].js` | `/shop/a/b/c` | `{ slug: ['a', 'b', 'c'] }` |\n\n## [Optional Catch-all Segments](#optional-catch-all-segments)\n\nCatch-all Segments can be made **optional** by including the parameter in double square brackets: `[[...segmentName]]`.\n\nFor example, `pages/shop/[[...slug]].js` will **also** match `/shop`, in addition to `/shop/clothes`, `/shop/clothes/tops`, `/shop/clothes/tops/t-shirts`.\n\nThe difference between **catch-all** and **optional catch-all** segments is that with optional, the route without the parameter is also matched (`/shop` in the example above).\n\n| Route | Example URL | `params` |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `pages/shop/[[...slug]].js` | `/shop` | `{ slug: [] }` |\n| `pages/shop/[[...slug]].js` | `/shop/a` | `{ slug: ['a'] }` |\n| `pages/shop/[[...slug]].js` | `/shop/a/b` | `{ slug: ['a', 'b'] }` |\n| `pages/shop/[[...slug]].js` | `/shop/a/b/c` | `{ slug: ['a', 'b', 'c'] }` |",

    "markdown": "# Routing: Middleware | Next.js\n\nMiddleware allows you to run code before a request is completed. Then, based on the incoming request, you can modify the response by rewriting, redirecting, modifying the request or response headers, or responding directly.\n\nMiddleware runs before cached content and routes are matched. See [Matching Paths](#matching-paths) for more details.\n\n## [Use Cases](#use-cases)\n\nIntegrating Middleware into your application can lead to significant improvements in performance, security, and user experience. Some common scenarios where Middleware is particularly effective include:\n\n*   Authentication and Authorization: Ensure user identity and check session cookies before granting access to specific pages or API routes.\n*   Server-Side Redirects: Redirect users at the server level based on certain conditions (e.g., locale, user role).\n*   Path Rewriting: Support A/B testing, feature rollouts, or legacy paths by dynamically rewriting paths to API routes or pages based on request properties.\n*   Bot Detection: Protect your resources by detecting and blocking bot traffic.\n*   Logging and Analytics: Capture and analyze request data for insights before processing by the page or API.\n*   Feature Flagging: Enable or disable features dynamically for seamless feature rollouts or testing.\n\nRecognizing situations where middleware may not be the optimal approach is just as crucial. Here are some scenarios to be mindful of:\n\n*   Complex Data Fetching and Manipulation: Middleware is not designed for direct data fetching or manipulation, this should be done within Route Handlers or server-side utilities instead.\n*   Heavy Computational Tasks: Middleware should be lightweight and respond quickly or it can cause delays in page load. Heavy computational tasks or long-running processes should be done within dedicated Route Handlers.\n*   Extensive Session Management: While Middleware can manage basic session tasks, extensive session management should be managed by dedicated authentication services or within Route Handlers.\n*   Direct Database Operations: Performing direct database operations within Middleware is not recommended. Database interactions should done within Route Handlers or server-side utilities.\n\n## [Convention](#convention)\n\nUse the file `middleware.ts` (or `.js`) in the root of your project to define Middleware. For example, at the same level as `pages` or `app`, or inside `src` if applicable.\n\n> **Note**: While only one `middleware.ts` file is supported per project, you can still organize your middleware logic modularly. Break out middleware functionalities into separate `.ts` or `.js` files and import them into your main `middleware.ts` file. This allows for cleaner management of route-specific middleware, aggregated in the `middleware.ts` for centralized control. By enforcing a single middleware file, it simplifies configuration, prevents potential conflicts, and optimizes performance by avoiding multiple middleware layers.\n\n## [Example](#example)\n\n```\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\nimport type { NextRequest } from 'next/server'\n \n// This function can be marked `async` if using `await` inside\nexport function middleware(request: NextRequest) {\n  return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/home', request.url))\n}\n \n// See \"Matching Paths\" below to learn more\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: '/about/:path*',\n}\n```\n\n## [Matching Paths](#matching-paths)\n\nMiddleware will be invoked for **every route in your project**. Given this, it's crucial to use matchers to precisely target or exclude specific routes. The following is the execution order:\n\n1.  `headers` from `next.config.js`\n2.  `redirects` from `next.config.js`\n3.  Middleware (`rewrites`, `redirects`, etc.)\n4.  `beforeFiles` (`rewrites`) from `next.config.js`\n5.  Filesystem routes (`public/`, `_next/static/`, `pages/`, `app/`, etc.)\n6.  `afterFiles` (`rewrites`) from `next.config.js`\n7.  Dynamic Routes (`/blog/[slug]`)\n8.  `fallback` (`rewrites`) from `next.config.js`\n\nThere are two ways to define which paths Middleware will run on:\n\n1.  [Custom matcher config](#matcher)\n2.  [Conditional statements](#conditional-statements)\n\n### [Matcher](#matcher)\n\n`matcher` allows you to filter Middleware to run on specific paths.\n\n```\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: '/about/:path*',\n}\n```\n\nYou can match a single path or multiple paths with an array syntax:\n\n```\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: ['/about/:path*', '/dashboard/:path*'],\n}\n```\n\nThe `matcher` config allows full regex so matching like negative lookaheads or character matching is supported. An example of a negative lookahead to match all except specific paths can be seen here:\n\n```\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: [\n    /*\n     * Match all request paths except for the ones starting with:\n     * - api (API routes)\n     * - _next/static (static files)\n     * - _next/image (image optimization files)\n     * - favicon.ico (favicon file)\n     */\n    '/((?!api|_next/static|_next/image|favicon.ico).*)',\n  ],\n}\n```\n\nYou can also bypass Middleware for certain requests by using the `missing` or `has` arrays, or a combination of both:\n\n```\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: [\n    /*\n     * Match all request paths except for the ones starting with:\n     * - api (API routes)\n     * - _next/static (static files)\n     * - _next/image (image optimization files)\n     * - favicon.ico (favicon file)\n     */\n    {\n      source: '/((?!api|_next/static|_next/image|favicon.ico).*)',\n      missing: [\n        { type: 'header', key: 'next-router-prefetch' },\n        { type: 'header', key: 'purpose', value: 'prefetch' },\n      ],\n    },\n \n    {\n      source: '/((?!api|_next/static|_next/image|favicon.ico).*)',\n      has: [\n        { type: 'header', key: 'next-router-prefetch' },\n        { type: 'header', key: 'purpose', value: 'prefetch' },\n      ],\n    },\n \n    {\n      source: '/((?!api|_next/static|_next/image|favicon.ico).*)',\n      has: [{ type: 'header', key: 'x-present' }],\n      missing: [{ type: 'header', key: 'x-missing', value: 'prefetch' }],\n    },\n  ],\n}\n```\n\n> **Good to know**: The `matcher` values need to be constants so they can be statically analyzed at build-time. Dynamic values such as variables will be ignored.\n\nConfigured matchers:\n\n1.  MUST start with `/`\n2.  Can include named parameters: `/about/:path` matches `/about/a` and `/about/b` but not `/about/a/c`\n3.  Can have modifiers on named parameters (starting with `:`): `/about/:path*` matches `/about/a/b/c` because `*` is _zero or more_. `?` is _zero or one_ and `+` _one or more_\n4.  Can use regular expression enclosed in parenthesis: `/about/(.*)` is the same as `/about/:path*`\n\nRead more details on [path-to-regexp](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp#path-to-regexp-1) documentation.\n\n> **Good to know**: For backward compatibility, Next.js always considers `/public` as `/public/index`. Therefore, a matcher of `/public/:path` will match.\n\n### [Conditional Statements](#conditional-statements)\n\n```\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\nimport type { NextRequest } from 'next/server'\n \nexport function middleware(request: NextRequest) {\n  if (request.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith('/about')) {\n    return NextResponse.rewrite(new URL('/about-2', request.url))\n  }\n \n  if (request.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith('/dashboard')) {\n    return NextResponse.rewrite(new URL('/dashboard/user', request.url))\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## [NextResponse](#nextresponse)\n\nThe `NextResponse` API allows you to:\n\n*   `redirect` the incoming request to a different URL\n*   `rewrite` the response by displaying a given URL\n*   Set request headers for API Routes, `getServerSideProps`, and `rewrite` destinations\n*   Set response cookies\n*   Set response headers\n\nTo produce a response from Middleware, you can:\n\n1.  `rewrite` to a route ([Page](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts) or [Edge API Route](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes)) that produces a response\n2.  return a `NextResponse` directly. See [Producing a Response](#producing-a-response)\n\n## [Using Cookies](#using-cookies)\n\nCookies are regular headers. On a `Request`, they are stored in the `Cookie` header. On a `Response` they are in the `Set-Cookie` header. Next.js provides a convenient way to access and manipulate these cookies through the `cookies` extension on `NextRequest` and `NextResponse`.\n\n1.  For incoming requests, `cookies` comes with the following methods: `get`, `getAll`, `set`, and `delete` cookies. You can check for the existence of a cookie with `has` or remove all cookies with `clear`.\n2.  For outgoing responses, `cookies` have the following methods `get`, `getAll`, `set`, and `delete`.\n\n```\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\nimport type { NextRequest } from 'next/server'\n \nexport function middleware(request: NextRequest) {\n  // Assume a \"Cookie:nextjs=fast\" header to be present on the incoming request\n  // Getting cookies from the request using the `RequestCookies` API\n  let cookie = request.cookies.get('nextjs')\n  console.log(cookie) // => { name: 'nextjs', value: 'fast', Path: '/' }\n  const allCookies = request.cookies.getAll()\n  console.log(allCookies) // => [{ name: 'nextjs', value: 'fast' }]\n \n  request.cookies.has('nextjs') // => true\n  request.cookies.delete('nextjs')\n  request.cookies.has('nextjs') // => false\n \n  // Setting cookies on the response using the `ResponseCookies` API\n  const response = NextResponse.next()\n  response.cookies.set('vercel', 'fast')\n  response.cookies.set({\n    name: 'vercel',\n    value: 'fast',\n    path: '/',\n  })\n  cookie = response.cookies.get('vercel')\n  console.log(cookie) // => { name: 'vercel', value: 'fast', Path: '/' }\n  // The outgoing response will have a `Set-Cookie:vercel=fast;path=/` header.\n \n  return response\n}\n```\n\nYou can set request and response headers using the `NextResponse` API (setting _request_ headers is available since Next.js v13.0.0).\n\n```\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\nimport type { NextRequest } from 'next/server'\n \nexport function middleware(request: NextRequest) {\n  // Clone the request headers and set a new header `x-hello-from-middleware1`\n  const requestHeaders = new Headers(request.headers)\n  requestHeaders.set('x-hello-from-middleware1', 'hello')\n \n  // You can also set request headers in NextResponse.rewrite\n  const response = NextResponse.next({\n    request: {\n      // New request headers\n      headers: requestHeaders,\n    },\n  })\n \n  // Set a new response header `x-hello-from-middleware2`\n  response.headers.set('x-hello-from-middleware2', 'hello')\n  return response\n}\n```\n\n> **Good to know**: Avoid setting large headers as it might cause [431 Request Header Fields Too Large](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/431) error depending on your backend web server configuration.\n\n### [CORS](#cors)\n\nYou can set CORS headers in Middleware to allow cross-origin requests, including [simple](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS#simple_requests) and [preflighted](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS#preflighted_requests) requests.\n\n```\nimport { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n \nconst allowedOrigins = ['https://acme.com', 'https://my-app.org']\n \nconst corsOptions = {\n  'Access-Control-Allow-Methods': 'GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS',\n  'Access-Control-Allow-Headers': 'Content-Type, Authorization',\n}\n \nexport function middleware(request: NextRequest) {\n  // Check the origin from the request\n  const origin = request.headers.get('origin') ?? ''\n  const isAllowedOrigin = allowedOrigins.includes(origin)\n \n  // Handle preflighted requests\n  const isPreflight = request.method === 'OPTIONS'\n \n  if (isPreflight) {\n    const preflightHeaders = {\n      ...(isAllowedOrigin && { 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': origin }),\n      ...corsOptions,\n    }\n    return NextResponse.json({}, { headers: preflightHeaders })\n  }\n \n  // Handle simple requests\n  const response = NextResponse.next()\n \n  if (isAllowedOrigin) {\n    response.headers.set('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', origin)\n  }\n \n  Object.entries(corsOptions).forEach(([key, value]) => {\n    response.headers.set(key, value)\n  })\n \n  return response\n}\n \nexport const config = {\n  matcher: '/api/:path*',\n}\n```\n\n## [Producing a Response](#producing-a-response)\n\nYou can respond from Middleware directly by returning a `Response` or `NextResponse` instance. (This is available since [Next.js v13.1.0](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-13-1#nextjs-advanced-middleware))\n\n```\nimport { NextRequest } from 'next/server'\nimport { isAuthenticated } from '@lib/auth'\n \n// Limit the middleware to paths starting with `/api/`\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: '/api/:function*',\n}\n \nexport function middleware(request: NextRequest) {\n  // Call our authentication function to check the request\n  if (!isAuthenticated(request)) {\n    // Respond with JSON indicating an error message\n    return Response.json(\n      { success: false, message: 'authentication failed' },\n      { status: 401 }\n    )\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### [`waitUntil` and `NextFetchEvent`](#waituntil-and-nextfetchevent)\n\nThe `NextFetchEvent` object extends the native [`FetchEvent`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/FetchEvent) object, and includes the [`waitUntil()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/ExtendableEvent/waitUntil) method.\n\nThe `waitUntil()` method takes a promise as an argument, and extends the lifetime of the Middleware until the promise settles. This is useful for performing work in the background.\n\n```\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\nimport type { NextFetchEvent, NextRequest } from 'next/server'\n \nexport function middleware(req: NextRequest, event: NextFetchEvent) {\n  event.waitUntil(\n    fetch('https://my-analytics-platform.com', {\n      method: 'POST',\n      body: JSON.stringify({ pathname: req.nextUrl.pathname }),\n    })\n  )\n \n  return NextResponse.next()\n}\n```\n\n## [Advanced Middleware Flags](#advanced-middleware-flags)\n\nIn `v13.1` of Next.js two additional flags were introduced for middleware, `skipMiddlewareUrlNormalize` and `skipTrailingSlashRedirect` to handle advanced use cases.\n\n`skipTrailingSlashRedirect` disables Next.js redirects for adding or removing trailing slashes. This allows custom handling inside middleware to maintain the trailing slash for some paths but not others, which can make incremental migrations easier.\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  skipTrailingSlashRedirect: true,\n}\n```\n\n```\nconst legacyPrefixes = ['/docs', '/blog']\n \nexport default async function middleware(req) {\n  const { pathname } = req.nextUrl\n \n  if (legacyPrefixes.some((prefix) => pathname.startsWith(prefix))) {\n    return NextResponse.next()\n  }\n \n  // apply trailing slash handling\n  if (\n    !pathname.endsWith('/') &&\n    !pathname.match(/((?!\\.well-known(?:\\/.*)?)(?:[^/]+\\/)*[^/]+\\.\\w+)/)\n  ) {\n    req.nextUrl.pathname += '/'\n    return NextResponse.redirect(req.nextUrl)\n  }\n}\n```\n\n`skipMiddlewareUrlNormalize` allows for disabling the URL normalization in Next.js to make handling direct visits and client-transitions the same. In some advanced cases, this option provides full control by using the original URL.\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  skipMiddlewareUrlNormalize: true,\n}\n```\n\n```\nexport default async function middleware(req) {\n  const { pathname } = req.nextUrl\n \n  // GET /_next/data/build-id/hello.json\n \n  console.log(pathname)\n  // with the flag this now /_next/data/build-id/hello.json\n  // without the flag this would be normalized to /hello\n}\n```\n\n## [Runtime](#runtime)\n\nMiddleware currently only supports the [Edge runtime](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/edge-and-nodejs-runtimes). The Node.js runtime can not be used.\n\n## [Version History](#version-history)\n\n| Version | Changes |\n| --- | --- |\n| `v13.1.0` | Advanced Middleware flags added |\n| `v13.0.0` | Middleware can modify request headers, response headers, and send responses |\n| `v12.2.0` | Middleware is stable, please see the [upgrade guide](https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/middleware-upgrade-guide) |\n| `v12.0.9` | Enforce absolute URLs in Edge Runtime ([PR](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/33410)) |\n| `v12.0.0` | Middleware (Beta) added |",

    "markdown": "# Rendering: Server-side Rendering (SSR) | Next.js\n\n> Also referred to as \"SSR\" or \"Dynamic Rendering\".\n\nIf a page uses **Server-side Rendering**, the page HTML is generated on **each request**.\n\nTo use Server-side Rendering for a page, you need to `export` an `async` function called `getServerSideProps`. This function will be called by the server on every request.\n\nFor example, suppose that your page needs to pre-render frequently updated data (fetched from an external API). You can write `getServerSideProps` which fetches this data and passes it to `Page` like below:\n\n```\nexport default function Page({ data }) {\n  // Render data...\n}\n \n// This gets called on every request\nexport async function getServerSideProps() {\n  // Fetch data from external API\n  const res = await fetch(`https://.../data`)\n  const data = await res.json()\n \n  // Pass data to the page via props\n  return { props: { data } }\n}\n```\n\nAs you can see, `getServerSideProps` is similar to `getStaticProps`, but the difference is that `getServerSideProps` is run on every request instead of on build time.\n\nTo learn more about how `getServerSideProps` works, check out our [Data Fetching documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-server-side-props).",

That means in production, the page HTML is generated when you run `next build`. This HTML will then be reused on each request. It can be cached by a CDN.\n\nIn Next.js, you can statically generate pages **with or without data**. Let's take a look at each case.\n\n### [Static Generation without data](#static-generation-without-data)\n\nBy default, Next.js pre-renders pages using Static Generation without fetching data. Here's an example:\n\n```\nfunction About() {\n  return <div>About</div>\n}\n \nexport default About\n```\n\nNote that this page does not need to fetch any external data to be pre-rendered. In cases like this, Next.js generates a single HTML file per page during build time.\n\n### [Static Generation with data](#static-generation-with-data)\n\nSome pages require fetching external data for pre-rendering. There are two scenarios, and one or both might apply. In each case, you can use these functions that Next.js provides:\n\n1.  Your page **content** depends on external data: Use `getStaticProps`.\n2.  Your page **paths** depend on external data: Use `getStaticPaths` (usually in addition to `getStaticProps`).\n\n#### [Scenario 1: Your page content depends on external data](#scenario-1-your-page-content-depends-on-external-data)\n\n**Example**: Your blog page might need to fetch the list of blog posts from a CMS (content management system).\n\n```\n// TODO: Need to fetch `posts` (by calling some API endpoint)\n//       before this page can be pre-rendered.\nexport default function Blog({ posts }) {\n  return (\n    <ul>\n      {posts.map((post) => (\n        <li>{post.title}</li>\n      ))}\n    </ul>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nTo fetch this data on pre-render, Next.js allows you to `export` an `async` function called `getStaticProps` from the same file. This function gets called at build time and lets you pass fetched data to the page's `props` on pre-render.\n\n```\nexport default function Blog({ posts }) {\n  // Render posts...\n}\n \n// This function gets called at build time\nexport async function getStaticProps() {\n  // Call an external API endpoint to get posts\n  const res = await fetch('https://.../posts')\n  const posts = await res.json()\n \n  // By returning { props: { posts } }, the Blog component\n  // will receive `posts` as a prop at build time\n  return {\n    props: {\n      posts,\n    },\n  }\n}\n```\n\nTo learn more about how `getStaticProps` works, check out the [Data Fetching documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-static-props).\n\n#### [Scenario 2: Your page paths depend on external data](#scenario-2-your-page-paths-depend-on-external-data)\n\nNext.js allows you to create pages with **dynamic routes**. For example, you can create a file called `pages/posts/[id].js` to show a single blog post based on `id`. This will allow you to show a blog post with `id: 1` when you access `posts/1`.\n\n> To learn more about dynamic routing, check the [Dynamic Routing documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes).\n\nHowever, which `id` you want to pre-render at build time might depend on external data.\n\n**Example**: suppose that you've only added one blog post (with `id: 1`) to the database. In this case, you'd only want to pre-render `posts/1` at build time.\n\nLater, you might add the second post with `id: 2`. Then you'd want to pre-render `posts/2` as well.\n\nSo your page **paths** that are pre-rendered depend on external data. To handle this, Next.js lets you `export` an `async` function called `getStaticPaths` from a dynamic page (`pages/posts/[id].js` in this case). This function gets called at build time and lets you specify which paths you want to pre-render.\n\n```\n// This function gets called at build time\nexport async function getStaticPaths() {\n  // Call an external API endpoint to get posts\n  const res = await fetch('https://.../posts')\n  const posts = await res.json()\n \n  // Get the paths we want to pre-render based on posts\n  const paths = posts.map((post) => ({\n    params: { id: post.id },\n  }))\n \n  // We'll pre-render only these paths at build time.\n  // { fallback: false } means other routes should 404.\n  return { paths, fallback: false }\n}\n```\n\nAlso in `pages/posts/[id].js`, you need to export `getStaticProps` so that you can fetch the data about the post with this `id` and use it to pre-render the page:\n\n```\nexport default function Post({ post }) {\n  // Render post...\n}\n \nexport async function getStaticPaths() {\n  // ...\n}\n \n// This also gets called at build time\nexport async function getStaticProps({ params }) {\n  // params contains the post `id`.\n  // If the route is like /posts/1, then params.id is 1\n  const res = await fetch(`https://.../posts/${params.id}`)\n  const post = await res.json()\n \n  // Pass post data to the page via props\n  return { props: { post } }\n}\n```\n\nTo learn more about how `getStaticPaths` works, check out the [Data Fetching documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-static-paths).\n\n### [When should I use Static Generation?](#when-should-i-use-static-generation)\n\nWe recommend using **Static Generation** (with and without data) whenever possible because your page can be built once and served by CDN, which makes it much faster than having a server render the page on every request.\n\nYou can use Static Generation for many types of pages, including:\n\n*   Marketing pages\n*   Blog posts and portfolios\n*   E-commerce product listings\n*   Help and documentation\n\nYou should ask yourself: \"Can I pre-render this page **ahead** of a user's request?\" If the answer is yes, then you should choose Static Generation.\n\nOn the other hand, Static Generation is **not** a good idea if you cannot pre-render a page ahead of a user's request. Maybe your page shows frequently updated data, and the page content changes on every request.\n\nIn cases like this, you can do one of the following:\n\n*   Use Static Generation with **Client-side data fetching:** You can skip pre-rendering some parts of a page and then use client-side JavaScript to populate them. To learn more about this approach, check out the [Data Fetching documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/client-side).\n*   Use **Server-Side Rendering:** Next.js pre-renders a page on each request. It will be slower because the page cannot be cached by a CDN, but the pre-rendered page will always be up-to-date. We'll talk about this approach below.",

    "markdown": "# Routing: Redirecting | Next.js\n\nThere are a few ways you can handle redirects in Next.js. This page will go through each available option, use cases, and how to manage large numbers of redirects.\n\n| API | Purpose | Where | Status Code |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| [`useRouter`](#userouter-hook) | Perform a client-side navigation | Components | N/A |\n| [`redirects` in `next.config.js`](#redirects-in-nextconfigjs) | Redirect an incoming request based on a path | `next.config.js` file | 307 (Temporary) or 308 (Permanent) |\n| [`NextResponse.redirect`](#nextresponseredirect-in-middleware) | Redirect an incoming request based on a condition | Middleware | Any |\n\n## [`useRouter()` hook](#userouter-hook)\n\nIf you need to redirect inside a component, you can use the `push` method from the `useRouter` hook. For example:\n\n```\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/router'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  const router = useRouter()\n \n  return (\n    <button type=\"button\" onClick={() => router.push('/dashboard')}>\n      Dashboard\n    </button>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n> **Good to know**:\n> \n> *   If you don't need to programmatically navigate a user, you should use a [`<Link>`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/components/link) component.\n\nSee the [`useRouter` API reference](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/use-router) for more information.\n\n## [`redirects` in `next.config.js`](#redirects-in-nextconfigjs)\n\nThe `redirects` option in the `next.config.js` file allows you to redirect an incoming request path to a different destination path. This is useful when you change the URL structure of pages or have a list of redirects that are known ahead of time.\n\n`redirects` supports [path](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/redirects#path-matching), [header, cookie, and query matching](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/redirects#header-cookie-and-query-matching), giving you the flexibility to redirect users based on an incoming request.\n\nTo use `redirects`, add the option to your `next.config.js` file:\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  async redirects() {\n    return [\n      // Basic redirect\n      {\n        source: '/about',\n        destination: '/',\n        permanent: true,\n      },\n      // Wildcard path matching\n      {\n        source: '/blog/:slug',\n        destination: '/news/:slug',\n        permanent: true,\n      },\n    ]\n  },\n}\n```\n\nSee the [`redirects` API reference](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/redirects) for more information.\n\n> **Good to know**:\n> \n> *   `redirects` can return a 307 (Temporary Redirect) or 308 (Permanent Redirect) status code with the `permanent` option.\n> *   `redirects` may have a limit on platforms. For example, on Vercel, there's a limit of 1,024 redirects. To manage a large number of redirects (1000+), consider creating a custom solution using [Middleware](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware). See [managing redirects at scale](#managing-redirects-at-scale-advanced) for more.\n> *   `redirects` runs **before** Middleware.\n\n## [`NextResponse.redirect` in Middleware](#nextresponseredirect-in-middleware)\n\nMiddleware allows you to run code before a request is completed. Then, based on the incoming request, redirect to a different URL using `NextResponse.redirect`. This is useful if you want to redirect users based on a condition (e.g. authentication, session management, etc) or have [a large number of redirects](#managing-redirects-at-scale-advanced).\n\nFor example, to redirect the user to a `/login` page if they are not authenticated:\n\n```\nimport { NextResponse, NextRequest } from 'next/server'\nimport { authenticate } from 'auth-provider'\n \nexport function middleware(request: NextRequest) {\n  const isAuthenticated = authenticate(request)\n \n  // If the user is authenticated, continue as normal\n  if (isAuthenticated) {\n    return NextResponse.next()\n  }\n \n  // Redirect to login page if not authenticated\n  return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', request.url))\n}\n \nexport const config = {\n  matcher: '/dashboard/:path*',\n}\n```\n\n> **Good to know**:\n> \n> *   Middleware runs **after** `redirects` in `next.config.js` and **before** rendering.\n\nSee the [Middleware](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware) documentation for more information.\n\n## [Managing redirects at scale (advanced)](#managing-redirects-at-scale-advanced)\n\nTo manage a large number of redirects (1000+), you may consider creating a custom solution using Middleware. This allows you to handle redirects programmatically without having to redeploy your application.\n\nTo do this, you'll need to consider:\n\n1.  Creating and storing a redirect map.\n2.  Optimizing data lookup performance.\n\n> **Next.js Example**: See our [Middleware with Bloom filter](https://redirects-bloom-filter.vercel.app/) example for an implementation of the recommendations below.\n\n### [1\\. Creating and storing a redirect map](#1-creating-and-storing-a-redirect-map)\n\nA redirect map is a list of redirects that you can store in a database (usually a key-value store) or JSON file.\n\nConsider the following data structure:\n\n```\n{\n  \"/old\": {\n    \"destination\": \"/new\",\n    \"permanent\": true\n  },\n  \"/blog/post-old\": {\n    \"destination\": \"/blog/post-new\",\n    \"permanent\": true\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn [Middleware](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware), you can read from a database such as Vercel's [Edge Config](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/edge-config/get-started?utm_source=next-site&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=next-website) or [Redis](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-kv?utm_source=next-site&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=next-website), and redirect the user based on the incoming request:\n\n```\nimport { NextResponse, NextRequest } from 'next/server'\nimport { get } from '@vercel/edge-config'\n \ntype RedirectEntry = {\n  destination: string\n  permanent: boolean\n}\n \nexport async function middleware(request: NextRequest) {\n  const pathname = request.nextUrl.pathname\n  const redirectData = await get(pathname)\n \n  if (redirectData && typeof redirectData === 'string') {\n    const redirectEntry: RedirectEntry = JSON.parse(redirectData)\n    const statusCode = redirectEntry.permanent ? 308 : 307\n    return NextResponse.redirect(redirectEntry.destination, statusCode)\n  }\n \n  // No redirect found, continue without redirecting\n  return NextResponse.next()\n}\n```\n\n### [2\\. Optimizing data lookup performance](#2-optimizing-data-lookup-performance)\n\nReading a large dataset for every incoming request can be slow and expensive. There are two ways you can optimize data lookup performance:\n\n*   Use a database that is optimized for fast reads, such as [Vercel Edge Config](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/edge-config/get-started?utm_source=next-site&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=next-website) or [Redis](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-kv?utm_source=next-site&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=next-website).\n*   Use a data lookup strategy such as a [Bloom filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter) to efficiently check if a redirect exists **before** reading the larger redirects file or database.\n\nConsidering the previous example, you can import a generated bloom filter file into Middleware, then, check if the incoming request pathname exists in the bloom filter.\n\nIf it does, forward the request to a [API Routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) which will check the actual file and redirect the user to the appropriate URL. This avoids importing a large redirects file into Middleware, which can slow down every incoming request.\n\n```\nimport { NextResponse, NextRequest } from 'next/server'\nimport { ScalableBloomFilter } from 'bloom-filters'\nimport GeneratedBloomFilter from './redirects/bloom-filter.json'\n \ntype RedirectEntry = {\n  destination: string\n  permanent: boolean\n}\n \n// Initialize bloom filter from a generated JSON file\nconst bloomFilter = ScalableBloomFilter.fromJSON(GeneratedBloomFilter as any)\n \nexport async function middleware(request: NextRequest) {\n  // Get the path for the incoming request\n  const pathname = request.nextUrl.pathname\n \n  // Check if the path is in the bloom filter\n  if (bloomFilter.has(pathname)) {\n    // Forward the pathname to the Route Handler\n    const api = new URL(\n      `/api/redirects?pathname=${encodeURIComponent(request.nextUrl.pathname)}`,\n      request.nextUrl.origin\n    )\n \n    try {\n      // Fetch redirect data from the Route Handler\n      const redirectData = await fetch(api)\n \n      if (redirectData.ok) {\n        const redirectEntry: RedirectEntry | undefined =\n          await redirectData.json()\n \n        if (redirectEntry) {\n          // Determine the status code\n          const statusCode = redirectEntry.permanent ? 308 : 307\n \n          // Redirect to the destination\n          return NextResponse.redirect(redirectEntry.destination, statusCode)\n        }\n      }\n    } catch (error) {\n      console.error(error)\n    }\n  }\n \n  // No redirect found, continue the request without redirecting\n  return NextResponse.next()\n}\n```\n\nThen, in the API Route:\n\n```\nimport { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next'\nimport redirects from '@/app/redirects/redirects.json'\n \ntype RedirectEntry = {\n  destination: string\n  permanent: boolean\n}\n \nexport default function handler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {\n  const pathname = req.query.pathname\n  if (!pathname) {\n    return res.status(400).json({ message: 'Bad Request' })\n  }\n \n  // Get the redirect entry from the redirects.json file\n  const redirect = (redirects as Record<string, RedirectEntry>)[pathname]\n \n  // Account for bloom filter false positives\n  if (!redirect) {\n    return res.status(400).json({ message: 'No redirect' })\n  }\n \n  // Return the redirect entry\n  return res.json(redirect)\n}\n```\n\n> **Good to know:**\n> \n> *   To generate a bloom filter, you can use a library like [`bloom-filters`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bloom-filters).\n> *   You should validate requests made to your Route Handler to prevent malicious requests.",

    "markdown": "# Routing: Linking and Navigating | Next.js\n\nThe Next.js router allows you to do client-side route transitions between pages, similar to a single-page application.\n\nA React component called `Link` is provided to do this client-side route transition.\n\n```\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n \nfunction Home() {\n  return (\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        <Link href=\"/\">Home</Link>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <Link href=\"/about\">About Us</Link>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <Link href=\"/blog/hello-world\">Blog Post</Link>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n  )\n}\n \nexport default Home\n```\n\nThe example above uses multiple links. Each one maps a path (`href`) to a known page:\n\n*   `/` → `pages/index.js`\n*   `/about` → `pages/about.js`\n*   `/blog/hello-world` → `pages/blog/[slug].js`\n\nAny `<Link />` in the viewport (initially or through scroll) will be prefetched by default (including the corresponding data) for pages using [Static Generation](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-static-props). The corresponding data for [server-rendered](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-server-side-props) routes is fetched _only when_ the `<Link />` is clicked.\n\n## [Linking to dynamic paths](#linking-to-dynamic-paths)\n\nYou can also use interpolation to create the path, which comes in handy for [dynamic route segments](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes). For example, to show a list of posts which have been passed to the component as a prop:\n\n```\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n \nfunction Posts({ posts }) {\n  return (\n    <ul>\n      {posts.map((post) => (\n        <li key={post.id}>\n          <Link href={`/blog/${encodeURIComponent(post.slug)}`}>\n            {post.title}\n          </Link>\n        </li>\n      ))}\n    </ul>\n  )\n}\n \nexport default Posts\n```\n\n> [`encodeURIComponent`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/encodeURIComponent) is used in the example to keep the path utf-8 compatible.\n\nAlternatively, using a URL Object:\n\n```\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n \nfunction Posts({ posts }) {\n  return (\n    <ul>\n      {posts.map((post) => (\n        <li key={post.id}>\n          <Link\n            href={{\n              pathname: '/blog/[slug]',\n              query: { slug: post.slug },\n            }}\n          >\n            {post.title}\n          </Link>\n        </li>\n      ))}\n    </ul>\n  )\n}\n \nexport default Posts\n```\n\nNow, instead of using interpolation to create the path, we use a URL object in `href` where:\n\n*   `pathname` is the name of the page in the `pages` directory. `/blog/[slug]` in this case.\n*   `query` is an object with the dynamic segment. `slug` in this case.\n\n## [Injecting the router](#injecting-the-router)\n\nExamples\n\n*   [Dynamic Routing](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/dynamic-routing)\n\nTo access the [`router` object](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/use-router#router-object) in a React component you can use [`useRouter`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/use-router) or [`withRouter`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/use-router#withrouter).\n\nIn general we recommend using [`useRouter`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/use-router).\n\n## [Imperative Routing](#imperative-routing)\n\n[`next/link`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/components/link) should be able to cover most of your routing needs, but you can also do client-side navigations without it, take a look at the [documentation for `next/router`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/use-router).\n\nThe following example shows how to do basic page navigations with [`useRouter`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/use-router):\n\n```\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/router'\n \nexport default function ReadMore() {\n  const router = useRouter()\n \n  return (\n    <button onClick={() => router.push('/about')}>\n      Click here to read more\n    </button>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n## [Shallow Routing](#shallow-routing)\n\nExamples\n\n*   [Shallow Routing](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-shallow-routing)\n\nShallow routing allows you to change the URL without running data fetching methods again, that includes [`getServerSideProps`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-server-side-props), [`getStaticProps`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-static-props), and [`getInitialProps`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/get-initial-props).\n\nYou'll receive the updated `pathname` and the `query` via the [`router` object](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/use-router#router-object) (added by [`useRouter`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/use-router) or [`withRouter`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/use-router#withrouter)), without losing state.\n\nTo enable shallow routing, set the `shallow` option to `true`. Consider the following example:\n\n```\nimport { useEffect } from 'react'\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/router'\n \n// Current URL is '/'\nfunction Page() {\n  const router = useRouter()\n \n  useEffect(() => {\n    // Always do navigations after the first render\n    router.push('/?counter=10', undefined, { shallow: true })\n  }, [])\n \n  useEffect(() => {\n    // The counter changed!\n  }, [router.query.counter])\n}\n \nexport default Page\n```\n\nThe URL will get updated to `/?counter=10` and the page won't get replaced, only the state of the route is changed.\n\nYou can also watch for URL changes via [`componentDidUpdate`](https://react.dev/reference/react/Component#componentdidupdate) as shown below:\n\n```\ncomponentDidUpdate(prevProps) {\n  const { pathname, query } = this.props.router\n  // verify props have changed to avoid an infinite loop\n  if (query.counter !== prevProps.router.query.counter) {\n    // fetch data based on the new query\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### [Caveats](#caveats)\n\nShallow routing **only** works for URL changes in the current page. For example, let's assume we have another page called `pages/about.js`, and you run this:\n\n```\nrouter.push('/?counter=10', '/about?counter=10', { shallow: true })\n```\n\nSince that's a new page, it'll unload the current page, load the new one and wait for data fetching even though we asked to do shallow routing.\n\nWhen shallow routing is used with middleware it will not ensure the new page matches the current page like previously done without middleware. This is due to middleware being able to rewrite dynamically and can't be verified client-side without a data fetch which is skipped with shallow, so a shallow route change must always be treated as shallow.",

    "markdown": "# Rendering: Automatic Static Optimization | Next.js\n\nNext.js automatically determines that a page is static (can be prerendered) if it has no blocking data requirements. This determination is made by the absence of `getServerSideProps` and `getInitialProps` in the page.\n\nThis feature allows Next.js to emit hybrid applications that contain **both server-rendered and statically generated pages**.\n\n> Statically generated pages are still reactive: Next.js will hydrate your application client-side to give it full interactivity.\n\nOne of the main benefits of this feature is that optimized pages require no server-side computation, and can be instantly streamed to the end-user from multiple CDN locations. The result is an _ultra fast_ loading experience for your users.\n\n## [How it works](#how-it-works)\n\nIf `getServerSideProps` or `getInitialProps` is present in a page, Next.js will switch to render the page on-demand, per-request (meaning [Server-Side Rendering](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/rendering/server-side-rendering)).\n\nIf the above is not the case, Next.js will **statically optimize** your page automatically by prerendering the page to static HTML.\n\nDuring prerendering, the router's `query` object will be empty since we do not have `query` information to provide during this phase. After hydration, Next.js will trigger an update to your application to provide the route parameters in the `query` object.\n\nThe cases where the query will be updated after hydration triggering another render are:\n\n*   The page is a [dynamic-route](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes).\n*   The page has query values in the URL.\n*   [Rewrites](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/next-config-js/rewrites) are configured in your `next.config.js` since these can have parameters that may need to be parsed and provided in the `query`.\n\nTo be able to distinguish if the query is fully updated and ready for use, you can leverage the `isReady` field on [`next/router`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/use-router#router-object).\n\n> **Good to know**: Parameters added with [dynamic routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes) to a page that's using [`getStaticProps`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-static-props) will always be available inside the `query` object.\n\n`next build` will emit `.html` files for statically optimized pages. For example, the result for the page `pages/about.js` would be:\n\n```\n.next/server/pages/about.html\n```\n\nAnd if you add `getServerSideProps` to the page, it will then be JavaScript, like so:\n\n```\n.next/server/pages/about.js\n```\n\n## [Caveats](#caveats)\n\n*   If you have a [custom `App`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/custom-app) with `getInitialProps` then this optimization will be turned off in pages without [Static Generation](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-static-props).\n*   If you have a [custom `Document`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/custom-document) with `getInitialProps` be sure you check if `ctx.req` is defined before assuming the page is server-side rendered. `ctx.req` will be `undefined` for pages that are prerendered.\n*   Avoid using the `asPath` value on [`next/router`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/use-router#router-object) in the rendering tree until the router's `isReady` field is `true`. Statically optimized pages only know `asPath` on the client and not the server, so using it as a prop may lead to mismatch errors. The [`active-class-name` example](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/active-class-name) demonstrates one way to use `asPath` as a prop.",

    "markdown": "# Routing: Pages and Layouts | Next.js\n\nThe Pages Router has a file-system based router built on the concept of pages.\n\nWhen a file is added to the `pages` directory, it's automatically available as a route.\n\nIn Next.js, a **page** is a [React Component](https://react.dev/learn/your-first-component) exported from a `.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, or `.tsx` file in the `pages` directory. Each page is associated with a route based on its file name.\n\n**Example**: If you create `pages/about.js` that exports a React component like below, it will be accessible at `/about`.\n\n```\nexport default function About() {\n  return <div>About</div>\n}\n```\n\n## [Index routes](#index-routes)\n\nThe router will automatically route files named `index` to the root of the directory.\n\n*   `pages/index.js` → `/`\n*   `pages/blog/index.js` → `/blog`\n\n## [Nested routes](#nested-routes)\n\nThe router supports nested files.

Many of these components are often reused between pages. For example, you might have the same navigation bar and footer on every page.\n\n```\nimport Navbar from './navbar'\nimport Footer from './footer'\n \nexport default function Layout({ children }) {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Navbar />\n      <main>{children}</main>\n      <Footer />\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n## [Examples](#examples)\n\n### [Single Shared Layout with Custom App](#single-shared-layout-with-custom-app)\n\nIf you only have one layout for your entire application, you can create a [Custom App](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/custom-app) and wrap your application with the layout. Since the `<Layout />` component is re-used when changing pages, its component state will be preserved (e.g. input values).\n\n```\nimport Layout from '../components/layout'\n \nexport default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {\n  return (\n    <Layout>\n      <Component {...pageProps} />\n    </Layout>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n### [Per-Page Layouts](#per-page-layouts)\n\nIf you need multiple layouts, you can add a property `getLayout` to your page, allowing you to return a React component for the layout. This allows you to define the layout on a _per-page basis_. Since we're returning a function, we can have complex nested layouts if desired.\n\n```\n \nimport Layout from '../components/layout'\nimport NestedLayout from '../components/nested-layout'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    /** Your content */\n  )\n}\n \nPage.getLayout = function getLayout(page) {\n  return (\n    <Layout>\n      <NestedLayout>{page}</NestedLayout>\n    </Layout>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```\nexport default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {\n  // Use the layout defined at the page level, if available\n  const getLayout = Component.getLayout ?? ((page) => page)\n \n  return getLayout(<Component {...pageProps} />)\n}\n```\n\nWhen navigating between pages, we want to _persist_ page state (input values, scroll position, etc.) for a Single-Page Application (SPA) experience.\n\nThis layout pattern enables state persistence because the React component tree is maintained between page transitions. With the component tree, React can understand which elements have changed to preserve state.\n\n> **Good to know**: This process is called [reconciliation](https://react.dev/learn/preserving-and-resetting-state), which is how React understands which elements have changed.\n\n### [With TypeScript](#with-typescript)\n\nWhen using TypeScript, you must first create a new type for your pages which includes a `getLayout` function. Then, you must create a new type for your `AppProps` which overrides the `Component` property to use the previously created type.\n\n```\nimport type { ReactElement } from 'react'\nimport Layout from '../components/layout'\nimport NestedLayout from '../components/nested-layout'\nimport type { NextPageWithLayout } from './_app'\n \nconst Page: NextPageWithLayout = () => {\n  return <p>hello world</p>\n}\n \nPage.getLayout = function getLayout(page: ReactElement) {\n  return (\n    <Layout>\n      <NestedLayout>{page}</NestedLayout>\n    </Layout>\n  )\n}\n \nexport default Page\n```\n\n```\nimport type { ReactElement, ReactNode } from 'react'\nimport type { NextPage } from 'next'\nimport type { AppProps } from 'next/app'\n \nexport type NextPageWithLayout<P = {}, IP = P> = NextPage<P, IP> & {\n  getLayout?: (page: ReactElement) => ReactNode\n}\n \ntype AppPropsWithLayout = AppProps & {\n  Component: NextPageWithLayout\n}\n \nexport default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppPropsWithLayout) {\n  // Use the layout defined at the page level, if available\n  const getLayout = Component.getLayout ?? ((page) => page)\n \n  return getLayout(<Component {...pageProps} />)\n}\n```\n\n### [Data Fetching](#data-fetching)\n\nInside your layout, you can fetch data on the client-side using `useEffect` or a library like [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/). Because this file is not a [Page](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts), you cannot use `getStaticProps` or `getServerSideProps` currently.\n\n```\nimport useSWR from 'swr'\nimport Navbar from './navbar'\nimport Footer from './footer'\n \nexport default function Layout({ children }) {\n  const { data, error } = useSWR('/api/navigation', fetcher)\n \n  if (error) return <div>Failed to load</div>\n  if (!data) return <div>Loading...</div>\n \n  return (\n    <>\n      <Navbar links={data.links} />\n      <main>{children}</main>\n      <Footer />\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```",

    "markdown": "# Rendering: Client-side Rendering (CSR) | Next.js\n\nIn Client-Side Rendering (CSR) with React, the browser downloads a minimal HTML page and the JavaScript needed for the page. The JavaScript is then used to update the DOM and render the page. When the application is first loaded, the user may notice a slight delay before they can see the full page, this is because the page isn't fully rendered until all the JavaScript is downloaded, parsed, and executed.\n\nAfter the page has been loaded for the first time, navigating to other pages on the same website is typically faster, as only necessary data needs to be fetched, and JavaScript can re-render parts of the page without requiring a full page refresh.\n\nIn Next.js, there are two ways you can implement client-side rendering:\n\n1.  Using React's `useEffect()` hook inside your pages instead of the server-side rendering methods ([`getStaticProps`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-static-props) and [`getServerSideProps`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-server-side-props)).\n2.  Using a data fetching library like [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/) or [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/) to fetch data on the client (recommended).\n\nHere's an example of using `useEffect()` inside a Next.js page:\n\n```\nimport React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react'\n \nexport function Page() {\n  const [data, setData] = useState(null)\n \n  useEffect(() => {\n    const fetchData = async () => {\n      const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data')\n      if (!response.ok) {\n        throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`)\n      }\n      const result = await response.json()\n      setData(result)\n    }\n \n    fetchData().catch((e) => {\n      // handle the error as needed\n      console.error('An error occurred while fetching the data: ', e)\n    })\n  }, [])\n \n  return <p>{data ? `Your data: ${data}` : 'Loading...'}</p>\n}\n```\n\nIn the example above, the component starts by rendering `Loading...`. Then, once the data is fetched, it re-renders and displays the data.\n\nAlthough fetching data in a `useEffect` is a pattern you may see in older React Applications, we recommend using a data-fetching library for better performance, caching, optimistic updates, and more. Here's a minimum example using [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/) to fetch data on the client:\n\n```\nimport useSWR from 'swr'\n \nexport function Page() {\n  const { data, error, isLoading } = useSWR(\n    'https://api.example.com/data',\n    fetcher\n  )\n \n  if (error) return <p>Failed to load.</p>\n  if (isLoading) return <p>Loading...</p>\n \n  return <p>Your Data: {data}</p>\n}\n```\n\n> **Good to know**:\n> \n> Keep in mind that CSR can impact SEO. Some search engine crawlers might not execute JavaScript and therefore only see the initial empty or loading state of your application. It can also lead to performance issues for users with slower internet connections or devices, as they need to wait for all the JavaScript to load and run before they can see the full page. Next.js promotes a hybrid approach that allows you to use a combination of [server-side rendering](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/rendering/server-side-rendering), [static site generation](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/rendering/static-site-generation), and client-side rendering, **depending on the needs of each page** in your application. In the App Router, you can also use [Loading UI with Suspense](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/loading-ui-and-streaming) to show a loading indicator while the page is being rendered.",

    "markdown": "# Rendering: Edge and Node.js Runtimes\n\nIn the context of Next.js, runtime refers to the set of libraries, APIs, and general functionality available to your code during execution.\n\nOn the server, there are two runtimes where parts of your application code can be rendered:\n\n*   The **Node.js Runtime** (default) has access to all Node.js APIs and compatible packages from the ecosystem.\n*   The **Edge Runtime** is based on [Web APIs](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/edge).\n\n## [Runtime Differences](#runtime-differences)\n\nThere are many considerations to make when choosing a runtime. This table shows the major differences at a glance. If you want a more in-depth analysis of the differences, check out the sections below.\n\n### [Edge Runtime](#edge-runtime)\n\nIn Next.js, the lightweight Edge Runtime is a subset of available Node.js APIs.\n\nThe Edge Runtime is ideal if you need to deliver dynamic, personalized content at low latency with small, simple functions. The Edge Runtime's speed comes from its minimal use of resources, but that can be limiting in many scenarios.\n\nFor example, code executed in the Edge Runtime [on Vercel cannot exceed between 1 MB and 4 MB](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/limits/overview#edge-middleware-and-edge-functions-size), this limit includes imported packages, fonts and files, and will vary depending on your deployment infrastructure. In addition, the Edge Runtime does not support all Node.js APIs meaning some `npm` packages may not work. For example, \"Module not found: Can't resolve 'fs'\" or similar errors. We recommend using the Node.js runtime if you need to use these APIs or packages.\n\n### [Node.js Runtime](#nodejs-runtime)\n\nUsing the Node.js runtime gives you access to all Node.js APIs, and all npm packages that rely on them. However, it's not as fast to start up as routes using the Edge runtime.\n\nDeploying your Next.js application to a Node.js server will require managing, scaling, and configuring your infrastructure. Alternatively, you can consider deploying your Next.js application to a serverless platform like Vercel, which will handle this for you.\n\n### [Serverless Node.js](#serverless-nodejs)\n\nServerless is ideal if you need a scalable solution that can handle more complex computational loads than the Edge Runtime. With Serverless Functions on Vercel, for example, your overall code size is [50MB](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/limits/overview#serverless-function-size) including imported packages, fonts, and files.\n\nThe downside compared to routes using the [Edge](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/edge-functions) is that it can take hundreds of milliseconds for Serverless Functions to boot up before they begin processing requests. Depending on the amount of traffic your site receives, this could be a frequent occurrence as the functions are not frequently \"warm\".\n\n> Please refer to the [Node.js Docs](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/) and [Edge Docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/edge) for the full list of available APIs. Both runtimes can also support [streaming](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/loading-ui-and-streaming) depending on your deployment infrastructure.",

    "markdown": "# Data Fetching: getStaticProps | Next.js\n\nIf you export a function called `getStaticProps` (Static Site Generation) from a page, Next.js will pre-render this page at build time using the props returned by `getStaticProps`.\n\n```\nimport type { InferGetStaticPropsType, GetStaticProps } from 'next'\n \ntype Repo = {\n  name: string\n  stargazers_count: number\n}\n \nexport const getStaticProps = (async (context) => {\n  const res = await fetch('https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js')\n  const repo = await res.json()\n  return { props: { repo } }\n}) satisfies GetStaticProps<{\n  repo: Repo\n}>\n \nexport default function Page({\n  repo,\n}: InferGetStaticPropsType<typeof getStaticProps>) {\n  return repo.stargazers_count\n}\n```\n\n> Note that irrespective of rendering type, any `props` will be passed to the page component and can be viewed on the client-side in the initial HTML. This is to allow the page to be [hydrated](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/hydrate) correctly. Make sure that you don't pass any sensitive information that shouldn't be available on the client in `props`.\n\nThe [`getStaticProps` API reference](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/get-static-props) covers all parameters and props that can be used with `getStaticProps`.\n\n## [When should I use getStaticProps?](#when-should-i-use-getstaticprops)\n\nYou should use `getStaticProps` if:\n\n*   The data required to render the page is available at build time ahead of a user’s request\n*   The data comes from a headless CMS\n*   The page must be pre-rendered (for SEO) and be very fast — `getStaticProps` generates `HTML` and `JSON` files, both of which can be cached by a CDN for performance\n*   The data can be publicly cached (not user-specific). This condition can be bypassed in certain specific situation by using a Middleware to rewrite the path.\n\n## [When does getStaticProps run](#when-does-getstaticprops-run)\n\n`getStaticProps` always runs on the server and never on the client. You can validate code written inside `getStaticProps` is removed from the client-side bundle [with this tool](https://next-code-elimination.vercel.app/).\n\n*   `getStaticProps` always runs during `next build`\n*   `getStaticProps` runs in the background when using [`fallback: true`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/get-static-paths#fallback-true)\n*   `getStaticProps` is called before initial render when using [`fallback: blocking`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/get-static-paths#fallback-blocking)\n*   `getStaticProps` runs in the background when using `revalidate`\n*   `getStaticProps` runs on-demand in the background when using [`revalidate()`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/incremental-static-regeneration#on-demand-revalidation)\n\nWhen combined with [Incremental Static Regeneration](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/incremental-static-regeneration), `getStaticProps` will run in the background while the stale page is being revalidated, and the fresh page served to the browser.\n\n`getStaticProps` does not have access to the incoming request (such as query parameters or HTTP headers) as it generates static HTML. If you need access to the request for your page, consider using [Middleware](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/middleware) in addition to `getStaticProps`.\n\n## [Using getStaticProps to fetch data from a CMS](#using-getstaticprops-to-fetch-data-from-a-cms)\n\nThe following example shows how you can fetch a list of blog posts from a CMS.\n\n```\n// posts will be populated at build time by getStaticProps()\nexport default function Blog({ posts }) {\n  return (\n    <ul>\n      {posts.map((post) => (\n        <li>{post.title}</li>\n      ))}\n    </ul>\n  )\n}\n \n// This function gets called at build time on server-side.\n// It won't be called on client-side, so you can even do\n// direct database queries.\nexport async function getStaticProps() {\n  // Call an external API endpoint to get posts.\n  // You can use any data fetching library\n  const res = await fetch('https://.../posts')\n  const posts = await res.json()\n \n  // By returning { props: { posts } }, the Blog component\n  // will receive `posts` as a prop at build time\n  return {\n    props: {\n      posts,\n    },\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe [`getStaticProps` API reference](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/get-static-props) covers all parameters and props that can be used with `getStaticProps`.\n\n## [Write server-side code directly](#write-server-side-code-directly)\n\nAs `getStaticProps` runs only on the server-side, it will never run on the client-side. It won’t even be included in the JS bundle for the browser, so you can write direct database queries without them being sent to browsers.\n\nThis means that instead of fetching an **API route** from `getStaticProps` (that itself fetches data from an external source), you can write the server-side code directly in `getStaticProps`.\n\nTake the following example. An API route is used to fetch some data from a CMS. That API route is then called directly from `getStaticProps`. This produces an additional call, reducing performance. Instead, the logic for fetching the data from the CMS can be shared by using a `lib/` directory. Then it can be shared with `getStaticProps`.\n\n```\n// The following function is shared\n// with getStaticProps and API routes\n// from a `lib/` directory\nexport async function loadPosts() {\n  // Call an external API endpoint to get posts\n  const res = await fetch('https://.../posts/')\n  const data = await res.json()\n \n  return data\n}\n```\n\n```\n// pages/blog.js\nimport { loadPosts } from '../lib/load-posts'\n \n// This function runs only on the server side\nexport async function getStaticProps() {\n  // Instead of fetching your `/api` route you can call the same\n  // function directly in `getStaticProps`\n  const posts = await loadPosts()\n \n  // Props returned will be passed to the page component\n  return { props: { posts } }\n}\n```\n\nAlternatively, if you are **not** using API routes to fetch data, then the [`fetch()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) API _can_ be used directly in `getStaticProps` to fetch data.\n\nTo verify what Next.js eliminates from the client-side bundle, you can use the [next-code-elimination tool](https://next-code-elimination.vercel.app/).\n\n## [Statically generates both HTML and JSON](#statically-generates-both-html-and-json)\n\nWhen a page with `getStaticProps` is pre-rendered at build time, in addition to the page HTML file, Next.js generates a JSON file holding the result of running `getStaticProps`.\n\nThis JSON file will be used in client-side routing through [`next/link`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/components/link) or [`next/router`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/use-router). When you navigate to a page that’s pre-rendered using `getStaticProps`, Next.js fetches this JSON file (pre-computed at build time) and uses it as the props for the page component. This means that client-side page transitions will **not** call `getStaticProps` as only the exported JSON is used.\n\nWhen using Incremental Static Generation, `getStaticProps` will be executed in the background to generate the JSON needed for client-side navigation. You may see this in the form of multiple requests being made for the same page, however, this is intended and has no impact on end-user performance.\n\n## [Where can I use getStaticProps](#where-can-i-use-getstaticprops)\n\n`getStaticProps` can only be exported from a **page**. You **cannot** export it from non-page files, `_app`, `_document`, or `_error`.\n\nOne of the reasons for this restriction is that React needs to have all the required data before the page is rendered.\n\nAlso, you must use export `getStaticProps` as a standalone function — it will **not** work if you add `getStaticProps` as a property of the page component.\n\n> **Good to know**: if you have created a [custom app](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/custom-app), ensure you are passing the `pageProps` to the page component as shown in the linked document, otherwise the props will be empty.\n\n## [Runs on every request in development](#runs-on-every-request-in-development)\n\nIn development (`next dev`), `getStaticProps` will be called on every request.\n\n## [Preview Mode](#preview-mode)\n\nYou can temporarily bypass static generation and render the page at **request time** instead of build time using [**Preview Mode**](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/preview-mode). For example, you might be using a headless CMS and want to preview drafts before they're published.",

    "markdown": "# Data Fetching: Forms and Mutations\n\nForms enable you to create and update data in web applications. Next.js provides a powerful way to handle form submissions and data mutations using **API Routes**.\n\n> **Good to know:**\n> \n> *   We will soon recommend [incrementally adopting](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/upgrading/app-router-migration) the App Router and using [Server Actions](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/server-actions-and-mutations) for handling form submissions and data mutations. Server Actions allow you to define asynchronous server functions that can be called directly from your components, without needing to manually create an API Route.\n> *   API Routes [do not specify CORS headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS), meaning they are same-origin only by default.\n> *   Since API Routes run on the server, we're able to use sensitive values (like API keys) through [Environment Variables](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/environment-variables) without exposing them to the client. This is critical for the security of your application.\n\n## [Examples](#examples)\n\n### [Server-only form](#server-only-form)\n\nWith the Pages Router, you need to manually create API endpoints to handle securely mutating data on the server.\n\n```\nimport type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next'\n \nexport default async function handler(\n  req: NextApiRequest,\n  res: NextApiResponse\n) {\n  const data = req.body\n  const id = await createItem(data)\n  res.status(200).json({ id })\n}\n```\n\nThen, call the API Route from the client with an event handler:\n\n```\nimport { FormEvent } from 'react'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  async function onSubmit(event: FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) {\n    event.preventDefault()\n \n    const formData = new FormData(event.currentTarget)\n    const response = await fetch('/api/submit', {\n      method: 'POST',\n      body: formData,\n    })\n \n    // Handle response if necessary\n    const data = await response.json()\n    // ...\n  }\n \n  return (\n    <form onSubmit={onSubmit}>\n      <input type=\"text\" name=\"name\" />\n      <button type=\"submit\">Submit</button>\n    </form>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n## [Form validation](#form-validation)\n\nWe recommend using HTML validation like `required` and `type=\"email\"` for basic client-side form validation.\n\nFor more advanced server-side validation, you can use a schema validation library like [zod](https://zod.dev/) to validate the form fields before mutating the data:\n\n```\nimport type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next'\nimport { z } from 'zod'\n \nconst schema = z.object({\n  // ...\n})\n \nexport default async function handler(\n  req: NextApiRequest,\n  res: NextApiResponse\n) {\n  const parsed = schema.parse(req.body)\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n### [Error handling](#error-handling)\n\nYou can use React state to show an error message when a form submission fails:\n\n```\nimport React, { useState, FormEvent } from 'react'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState<boolean>(false)\n  const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null)\n \n  async function onSubmit(event: FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) {\n    event.preventDefault()\n    setIsLoading(true)\n    setError(null) // Clear previous errors when a new request starts\n \n    try {\n      const formData = new FormData(event.currentTarget)\n      const response = await fetch('/api/submit', {\n        method: 'POST',\n        body: formData,\n      })\n \n      if (!response.ok) {\n        throw new Error('Failed to submit the data.

    "markdown": "# Data Fetching: Client-side Fetching | Next.js\n\nClient-side data fetching is useful when your page doesn't require SEO indexing, when you don't need to pre-render your data, or when the content of your pages needs to update frequently. Unlike the server-side rendering APIs, you can use client-side data fetching at the component level.\n\nIf done at the page level, the data is fetched at runtime, and the content of the page is updated as the data changes. When used at the component level, the data is fetched at the time of the component mount, and the content of the component is updated as the data changes.\n\nIt's important to note that using client-side data fetching can affect the performance of your application and the load speed of your pages. This is because the data fetching is done at the time of the component or pages mount, and the data is not cached.\n\n## [Client-side data fetching with useEffect](#client-side-data-fetching-with-useeffect)\n\nThe following example shows how you can fetch data on the client side using the useEffect hook.\n\n```\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react'\n \nfunction Profile() {\n  const [data, setData] = useState(null)\n  const [isLoading, setLoading] = useState(true)\n \n  useEffect(() => {\n    fetch('/api/profile-data')\n      .then((res) => res.json())\n      .then((data) => {\n        setData(data)\n        setLoading(false)\n      })\n  }, [])\n \n  if (isLoading) return <p>Loading...</p>\n  if (!data) return <p>No profile data</p>\n \n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>{data.name}</h1>\n      <p>{data.bio}</p>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n## [Client-side data fetching with SWR](#client-side-data-fetching-with-swr)\n\nThe team behind Next.js has created a React hook library for data fetching called [**SWR**](https://swr.vercel.app/). It is **highly recommended** if you are fetching data on the client-side. It handles caching, revalidation, focus tracking, refetching on intervals, and more.\n\nUsing the same example as above, we can now use SWR to fetch the profile data. SWR will automatically cache the data for us and will revalidate the data if it becomes stale.\n\nFor more information on using SWR, check out the [SWR docs](https://swr.vercel.app/docs/getting-started).\n\n```\nimport useSWR from 'swr'\n \nconst fetcher = (...args) => fetch(...args).then((res) => res.json())\n \nfunction Profile() {\n  const { data, error } = useSWR('/api/profile-data', fetcher)\n \n  if (error) return <div>Failed to load</div>\n  if (!data) return <div>Loading...</div>\n \n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>{data.name}</h1>\n      <p>{data.bio}</p>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```",

    "markdown": "# Data Fetching: Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)\n\nExamples\n\n*   [Next.js Commerce](https://nextjs.org/commerce)\n*   [GitHub Reactions Demo](https://reactions-demo.vercel.app/)\n*   [Static Tweet Demo](https://static-tweet.vercel.app/)\n\nNext.js allows you to create or update static pages _after_ you’ve built your site. Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) enables you to use static-generation on a per-page basis, **without needing to rebuild the entire site**. With ISR, you can retain the benefits of static while scaling to millions of pages.\n\n> **Good to know**: The [`edge` runtime](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/edge) is currently not compatible with ISR, although you can leverage `stale-while-revalidate` by setting the `cache-control` header manually.\n\nTo use ISR, add the `revalidate` prop to `getStaticProps`:\n\n```\nfunction Blog({ posts }) {\n  return (\n    <ul>\n      {posts.map((post) => (\n        <li key={post.id}>{post.title}</li>\n      ))}\n    </ul>\n  )\n}\n \n// This function gets called at build time on server-side.\n// It may be called again, on a serverless function, if\n// revalidation is enabled and a new request comes in\nexport async function getStaticProps() {\n  const res = await fetch('https://.../posts')\n  const posts = await res.json()\n \n  return {\n    props: {\n      posts,\n    },\n    // Next.js will attempt to re-generate the page:\n    // - When a request comes in\n    // - At most once every 10 seconds\n    revalidate: 10, // In seconds\n  }\n}\n \n// This function gets called at build time on server-side.\n// It may be called again, on a serverless function, if\n// the path has not been generated.\nexport async function getStaticPaths() {\n  const res = await fetch('https://.../posts')\n  const posts = await res.json()\n \n  // Get the paths we want to pre-render based on posts\n  const paths = posts.map((post) => ({\n    params: { id: post.id },\n  }))\n \n  // We'll pre-render only these paths at build time.\n  // { fallback: 'blocking' } will server-render pages\n  // on-demand if the path doesn't exist.\n  return { paths, fallback: 'blocking' }\n}\n \nexport default Blog\n```\n\nWhen a request is made to a page that was pre-rendered at build time, it will initially show the cached page.\n\n*   Any requests to the page after the initial request and before 10 seconds are also cached and instantaneous.\n*   After the 10-second window, the next request will still show the cached (stale) page\n*   Next.js triggers a regeneration of the page in the background.\n*   Once the page generates successfully, Next.js will invalidate the cache and show the updated page. If the background regeneration fails, the old page would still be unaltered.\n\nWhen a request is made to a path that hasn’t been generated, Next.js will server-render the page on the first request. Future requests will serve the static file from the cache. ISR on Vercel [persists the cache globally and handles rollbacks](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/next.js/incremental-static-regeneration?utm_source=next-site&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=next-website).\n\n> **Good to know**: Check if your upstream data provider has caching enabled by default. You might need to disable (e.g. `useCdn: false`), otherwise a revalidation won't be able to pull fresh data to update the ISR cache. Caching can occur at a CDN (for an endpoint being requested) when it returns the `Cache-Control` header.\n\n## [On-Demand Revalidation](#on-demand-revalidation)\n\nIf you set a `revalidate` time of `60`, all visitors will see the same generated version of your site for one minute. The only way to invalidate the cache is from someone visiting that page after the minute has passed.\n\nStarting with `v12.2.0`, Next.js supports On-Demand Incremental Static Regeneration to manually purge the Next.js cache for a specific page. This makes it easier to update your site when:\n\n*   Content from your headless CMS is created or updated\n*   Ecommerce metadata changes (price, description, category, reviews, etc.)\n\nInside `getStaticProps`, you do not need to specify `revalidate` to use on-demand revalidation. If `revalidate` is omitted, Next.js will use the default value of `false` (no revalidation) and only revalidate the page on-demand when `revalidate()` is called.\n\n> **Good to know**: [Middleware](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/middleware) won't be executed for On-Demand ISR requests. Instead, call `revalidate()` on the _exact_ path that you want revalidated. For example, if you have `pages/blog/[slug].js` and a rewrite from `/post-1` -> `/blog/post-1`, you would need to call `res.revalidate('/blog/post-1')`.\n\n### [Using On-Demand Revalidation](#using-on-demand-revalidation)\n\nFirst, create a secret token only known by your Next.js app. This secret will be used to prevent unauthorized access to the revalidation API Route. You can access the route (either manually or with a webhook) with the following URL structure:\n\n```\nhttps://<your-site.com>/api/revalidate?secret=<token>\n```\n\nNext, add the secret as an [Environment Variable](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/environment-variables) to your application. Finally, create the revalidation API Route:\n\n```\nexport default async function handler(req, res) {\n  // Check for secret to confirm this is a valid request\n  if (req.query.secret !== process.env.MY_SECRET_TOKEN) {\n    return res.status(401).json({ message: 'Invalid token' })\n  }\n \n  try {\n    // this should be the actual path not a rewritten path\n    // e.g. for \"/blog/[slug]\" this should be \"/blog/post-1\"\n    await res.revalidate('/path-to-revalidate')\n    return res.json({ revalidated: true })\n  } catch (err) {\n    // If there was an error, Next.js will continue\n    // to show the last successfully generated page\n    return res.status(500).send('Error revalidating')\n  }\n}\n```\n\n[View our demo](https://on-demand-isr.vercel.app/) to see on-demand revalidation in action and provide feedback.\n\n### [Testing on-Demand ISR during development](#testing-on-demand-isr-during-development)\n\nWhen running locally with `next dev`, `getStaticProps` is invoked on every request. To verify your on-demand ISR configuration is correct, you will need to create a [production build](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/next-cli#build) and start the [production server](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/next-cli#production):\n\n```\n$ next build\n$ next start\n```\n\nThen, you can confirm that static pages have successfully revalidated.\n\n## [Error handling and revalidation](#error-handling-and-revalidation)\n\nIf there is an error inside `getStaticProps` when handling background regeneration, or you manually throw an error, the last successfully generated page will continue to show. On the next subsequent request, Next.js will retry calling `getStaticProps`.\n\n```\nexport async function getStaticProps() {\n  // If this request throws an uncaught error, Next.js will\n  // not invalidate the currently shown page and\n  // retry getStaticProps on the next request.\n  const res = await fetch('https://.../posts')\n  const posts = await res.json()\n \n  if (!res.ok) {\n    // If there is a server error, you might want to\n    // throw an error instead of returning so that the cache is not updated\n    // until the next successful request.\n    throw new Error(`Failed to fetch posts, received status ${res.status}`)\n  }\n \n  // If the request was successful, return the posts\n  // and revalidate every 10 seconds.\n  return {\n    props: {\n      posts,\n    },\n    revalidate: 10,\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## [Self-hosting ISR](#self-hosting-isr)\n\nIncremental Static Regeneration (ISR) works on [self-hosted Next.js sites](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/deploying#self-hosting) out of the box when you use `next start`.\n\nLearn more about [self-hosting Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/deploying#self-hosting).\n\n## [Version History](#version-history)\n\n| Version | Changes |\n| --- | --- |\n| `v14.1.0` | Custom `cacheHandler` is stable. |\n| `v12.2.0` | On-Demand ISR is stable |\n| `v12.1.0` | On-Demand ISR added (beta). |\n| `v12.0.0` | [Bot-aware ISR fallback](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-12#bot-aware-isr-fallback) added. |\n| `v9.5.0` | Base Path added. |",

    "markdown": "# Data Fetching: getServerSideProps | Next.js\n\n`getServerSideProps` is a Next.js function that can be used to fetch data and render the contents of a page at request time.\n\n## [Example](#example)\n\nYou can use `getServerSideProps` by exporting it from a Page Component. The example below shows how you can fetch data from a 3rd party API in `getServerSideProps`, and pass the data to the page as props:\n\n```\nimport type { InferGetServerSidePropsType, GetServerSideProps } from 'next'\n \ntype Repo = {\n  name: string\n  stargazers_count: number\n}\n \nexport const getServerSideProps = (async () => {\n  // Fetch data from external API\n  const res = await fetch('https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js')\n  const repo: Repo = await res.json()\n  // Pass data to the page via props\n  return { props: { repo } }\n}) satisfies GetServerSideProps<{ repo: Repo }>\n \nexport default function Page({\n  repo,\n}: InferGetServerSidePropsType<typeof getServerSideProps>) {\n  return (\n    <main>\n      <p>{repo.stargazers_count}</p>\n    </main>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n## [When should I use `getServerSideProps`?](#when-should-i-use-getserversideprops)\n\nYou should use `getServerSideProps` if you need to render a page that relies on personalized user data, or information that can only be known at request time. For example, `authorization` headers or a geolocation.\n\nIf you do not need to fetch the data at request time, or would prefer to cache the data and pre-rendered HTML, we recommend using [`getStaticProps`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-static-props).\n\n## [Behavior](#behavior)\n\n*   `getServerSideProps` runs on the server.\n*   `getServerSideProps` can only be exported from a **page**.\n*   `getServerSideProps` returns JSON.\n*   When a user visits a page, `getServerSideProps` will be used to fetch data at request time, and the data is used to render the initial HTML of the page.\n*   `props` passed to the page component can be viewed on the client as part of the initial HTML. This is to allow the page to be [hydrated](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/hydrate) correctly. Make sure that you don't pass any sensitive information that shouldn't be available on the client in `props`.\n*   When a user visits the page through [`next/link`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/components/link) or [`next/router`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/use-router), Next.js sends an API request to the server, which runs `getServerSideProps`.\n*   You do not have to call a Next.js [API Route](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) to fetch data when using `getServerSideProps` since the function runs on the server. Instead, you can call a CMS, database, or other third-party APIs directly from inside `getServerSideProps`.\n\n> **Good to know:**\n> \n> *   See [`getServerSideProps` API reference](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/get-server-side-props) for parameters and props that can be used with `getServerSideProps`.\n> *   You can use the [next-code-elimination tool](https://next-code-elimination.vercel.app/) to verify what Next.js eliminates from the client-side bundle.\n\n## [Error Handling](#error-handling)\n\nIf an error is thrown inside `getServerSideProps`, it will show the `pages/500.js` file. Check out the documentation for [500 page](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/custom-error#500-page) to learn more on how to create it. During development, this file will not be used and the development error overlay will be shown instead.\n\n## [Edge Cases](#edge-cases)\n\n### [Edge Runtime](#edge-runtime)\n\n`getServerSideProps` can be used with both [Serverless and Edge Runtimes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/rendering/edge-and-nodejs-runtimes), and you can set props in both.\n\nHowever, currently in the Edge Runtime, you do not have access to the response object. This means that you cannot — for example — add cookies in `getServerSideProps`. To have access to the response object, you should **continue to use the Node.js runtime**, which is the default runtime.\n\nYou can explicitly set the runtime on a per-page basis by modifying the `config`, for example:\n\n```\nexport const config = {\n  runtime: 'nodejs', // or \"edge\"\n}\n \nexport const getServerSideProps = async () => {}\n```\n\n### [Caching with Server-Side Rendering (SSR)](#caching-with-server-side-rendering-ssr)\n\nYou can use caching headers (`Cache-Control`) inside `getServerSideProps` to cache dynamic responses. For example, using [`stale-while-revalidate`](https://web.dev/stale-while-revalidate/).\n\n```\n// This value is considered fresh for ten seconds (s-maxage=10).\n// If a request is repeated within the next 10 seconds, the previously\n// cached value will still be fresh. If the request is repeated before 59 seconds,\n// the cached value will be stale but still render (stale-while-revalidate=59).\n//\n// In the background, a revalidation request will be made to populate the cache\n// with a fresh value. If you refresh the page, you will see the new value.\nexport async function getServerSideProps({ req, res }) {\n  res.setHeader(\n    'Cache-Control',\n    'public, s-maxage=10, stale-while-revalidate=59'\n  )\n \n  return {\n    props: {},\n  }\n}\n```\n\nHowever, before reaching for `cache-control`, we recommend seeing if [`getStaticProps`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-static-props) with [ISR](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/incremental-static-regeneration) is a better fit for your use case.",

    "markdown": "# Data Fetching: getStaticPaths | Next.js\n\nIf a page has [Dynamic Routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes) and uses `getStaticProps`, it needs to define a list of paths to be statically generated.\n\nWhen you export a function called `getStaticPaths` (Static Site Generation) from a page that uses dynamic routes, Next.js will statically pre-render all the paths specified by `getStaticPaths`.\n\n```\nimport type {\n  InferGetStaticPropsType,\n  GetStaticProps,\n  GetStaticPaths,\n} from 'next'\n \ntype Repo = {\n  name: string\n  stargazers_count: number\n}\n \nexport const getStaticPaths = (async () => {\n  return {\n    paths: [\n      {\n        params: {\n          name: 'next.js',\n        },\n      }, // See the \"paths\" section below\n    ],\n    fallback: true, // false or \"blocking\"\n  }\n}) satisfies GetStaticPaths\n \nexport const getStaticProps = (async (context) => {\n  const res = await fetch('https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js')\n  const repo = await res.json()\n  return { props: { repo } }\n}) satisfies GetStaticProps<{\n  repo: Repo\n}>\n \nexport default function Page({\n  repo,\n}: InferGetStaticPropsType<typeof getStaticProps>) {\n  return repo.stargazers_count\n}\n```\n\nThe [`getStaticPaths` API reference](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/get-static-paths) covers all parameters and props that can be used with `getStaticPaths`.\n\n## [When should I use getStaticPaths?](#when-should-i-use-getstaticpaths)\n\nYou should use `getStaticPaths` if you’re statically pre-rendering pages that use dynamic routes and:\n\n*   The data comes from a headless CMS\n*   The data comes from a database\n*   The data comes from the filesystem\n*   The data can be publicly cached (not user-specific)\n*   The page must be pre-rendered (for SEO) and be very fast — `getStaticProps` generates `HTML` and `JSON` files, both of which can be cached by a CDN for performance\n\n## [When does getStaticPaths run](#when-does-getstaticpaths-run)\n\n`getStaticPaths` will only run during build in production, it will not be called during runtime. You can validate code written inside `getStaticPaths` is removed from the client-side bundle [with this tool](https://next-code-elimination.vercel.app/).\n\n### [How does getStaticProps run with regards to getStaticPaths](#how-does-getstaticprops-run-with-regards-to-getstaticpaths)\n\n*   `getStaticProps` runs during `next build` for any `paths` returned during build\n*   `getStaticProps` runs in the background when using `fallback: true`\n*   `getStaticProps` is called before initial render when using `fallback: blocking`\n\n## [Where can I use getStaticPaths](#where-can-i-use-getstaticpaths)\n\n*   `getStaticPaths` **must** be used with `getStaticProps`\n*   You **cannot** use `getStaticPaths` with [`getServerSideProps`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-server-side-props)\n*   You can export `getStaticPaths` from a [Dynamic Route](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes) that also uses `getStaticProps`\n*   You **cannot** export `getStaticPaths` from non-page file (e.g. your `components` folder)\n*   You must export `getStaticPaths` as a standalone function, and not a property of the page component\n\n## [Runs on every request in development](#runs-on-every-request-in-development)\n\nIn development (`next dev`), `getStaticPaths` will be called on every request.\n\n## [Generating paths on-demand](#generating-paths-on-demand)\n\n`getStaticPaths` allows you to control which pages are generated during the build instead of on-demand with [`fallback`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/get-static-paths#fallback-blocking). Generating more pages during a build will cause slower builds.\n\nYou can defer generating all pages on-demand by returning an empty array for `paths`. This can be especially helpful when deploying your Next.js application to multiple environments. For example, you can have faster builds by generating all pages on-demand for previews (but not production builds). This is helpful for sites with hundreds/thousands of static pages.\n\n```\nexport async function getStaticPaths() {\n  // When this is true (in preview environments) don't\n  // prerender any static pages\n  // (faster builds, but slower initial page load)\n  if (process.env.SKIP_BUILD_STATIC_GENERATION) {\n    return {\n      paths: [],\n      fallback: 'blocking',\n    }\n  }\n \n  // Call an external API endpoint to get posts\n  const res = await fetch('https://.../posts')\n  const posts = await res.json()\n \n  // Get the paths we want to prerender based on posts\n  // In production environments, prerender all pages\n  // (slower builds, but faster initial page load)\n  const paths = posts.map((post) => ({\n    params: { id: post.id },\n  }))\n \n  // { fallback: false } means other routes should 404\n  return { paths, fallback: false }\n}\n```",

    "markdown": "# Styling: CSS Modules | Next.js\n\nExamples\n\n*   [Basic CSS Example](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/basic-css)\n\nNext.js supports different types of stylesheets, including:\n\n*   [CSS Modules](#css-modules)\n*   [Global Styles](#global-styles)\n*   [External Stylesheets](#external-stylesheets)\n\n## [CSS Modules](#css-modules)\n\nNext.js has built-in support for CSS Modules using the `.module.css` extension.\n\nCSS Modules locally scope CSS by automatically creating a unique class name. This allows you to use the same class name in different files without worrying about collisions. This behavior makes CSS Modules the ideal way to include component-level CSS.\n\n## [Example](#example)\n\nFor example, consider a reusable `Button` component in the `components/` folder:\n\nFirst, create `components/Button.module.css` with the following content:\n\n```\n/*\nYou do not need to worry about .error {} colliding with any other `.css` or\n`.module.css` files!\n*/\n.error {\n  color: white;\n  background-color: red;\n}\n```\n\nThen, create `components/Button.js`, importing and using the above CSS file:\n\n```\nimport styles from './Button.module.css'\n \nexport function Button() {\n  return (\n    <button\n      type=\"button\"\n      // Note how the \"error\" class is accessed as a property on the imported\n      // `styles` object.\n      className={styles.error}\n    >\n      Destroy\n    </button>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nCSS Modules are **only enabled for files with the `.module.css` and `.module.sass` extensions**.\n\nIn production, all CSS Module files will be automatically concatenated into **many minified and code-split** `.css` files. These `.css` files represent hot execution paths in your application, ensuring the minimal amount of CSS is loaded for your application to paint.\n\n## [Global Styles](#global-styles)\n\nTo add a stylesheet to your application, import the CSS file within `pages/_app.js`.\n\nFor example, consider the following stylesheet named `styles.css`:\n\n```\nbody {\n  font-family: 'SF Pro Text', 'SF Pro Icons', 'Helvetica Neue', 'Helvetica',\n    'Arial', sans-serif;\n  padding: 20px 20px 60px;\n  max-width: 680px;\n  margin: 0 auto;\n}\n```\n\nCreate a [`pages/_app.js` file](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/custom-app) if not already present. Then, [`import`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import) the `styles.css` file.\n\n```\nimport '../styles.css'\n \n// This default export is required in a new `pages/_app.js` file.\nexport default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {\n  return <Component {...pageProps} />\n}\n```\n\nThese styles (`styles.css`) will apply to all pages and components in your application. Due to the global nature of stylesheets, and to avoid conflicts, you may **only import them inside [`pages/_app.js`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/custom-app)**.\n\nIn development, expressing stylesheets this way allows your styles to be hot reloaded as you edit them—meaning you can keep application state.\n\nIn production, all CSS files will be automatically concatenated into a single minified `.css` file. The order that the CSS is concatenated will match the order the CSS is imported into the `_app.js` file. Pay special attention to imported JS modules that include their own CSS; the JS module's CSS will be concatenated following the same ordering rules as imported CSS files. For example:\n\n```\nimport '../styles.css'\n// The CSS in ErrorBoundary depends on the global CSS in styles.css,\n// so we import it after styles.css.\nimport ErrorBoundary from '../components/ErrorBoundary'\n \nexport default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {\n  return (\n    <ErrorBoundary>\n      <Component {...pageProps} />\n    </ErrorBoundary>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n## [External Stylesheets](#external-stylesheets)\n\nNext.js allows you to import CSS files from a JavaScript file. This is possible because Next.js extends the concept of [`import`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import) beyond JavaScript.\n\n### [Import styles from `node_modules`](#import-styles-from-node_modules)\n\nSince Next.js **9.5.4**, importing a CSS file from `node_modules` is permitted anywhere in your application.\n\nFor global stylesheets, like `bootstrap` or `nprogress`, you should import the file inside `pages/_app.js`. For example:\n\n```\nimport 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css'\n \nexport default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {\n  return <Component {...pageProps} />\n}\n```\n\nFor importing CSS required by a third-party component, you can do so in your component. For example:\n\n```\nimport { useState } from 'react'\nimport { Dialog } from '@reach/dialog'\nimport VisuallyHidden from '@reach/visually-hidden'\nimport '@reach/dialog/styles.css'\n \nfunction ExampleDialog(props) {\n  const [showDialog, setShowDialog] = useState(false)\n  const open = () => setShowDialog(true)\n  const close = () => setShowDialog(false)\n \n  return (\n    <div>\n      <button onClick={open}>Open Dialog</button>\n      <Dialog isOpen={showDialog} onDismiss={close}>\n        <button className=\"close-button\" onClick={close}>\n          <VisuallyHidden>Close</VisuallyHidden>\n          <span aria-hidden>×</span>\n        </button>\n        <p>Hello there. I am a dialog</p>\n      </Dialog>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n## [Additional Features](#additional-features)\n\nNext.js includes additional features to improve the authoring experience of adding styles:\n\n*   When running locally with `next dev`, local stylesheets (either global or CSS modules) will take advantage of [Fast Refresh](https://nextjs.org/docs/architecture/fast-refresh) to instantly reflect changes as edits are saved.\n*   When building for production with `next build`, CSS files will be bundled into fewer minified `.css` files to reduce the number of network requests needed to retrieve styles.\n*   If you disable JavaScript, styles will still be loaded in the production build (`next start`). However, JavaScript is still required for `next dev` to enable [Fast Refresh](https://nextjs.org/docs/architecture/fast-refresh).",

    "markdown": "# Optimizing: Fonts | Next.js\n\n## Font Optimization\n\n[**`next/font`**](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/components/font) will automatically optimize your fonts (including custom fonts) and remove external network requests for improved privacy and performance.\n\n> **🎥 Watch:** Learn more about using `next/font` → [YouTube (6 minutes)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8_98i_bMMA).\n\n`next/font` includes **built-in automatic self-hosting** for _any_ font file. This means you can optimally load web fonts with zero layout shift, thanks to the underlying CSS `size-adjust` property used.\n\nThis new font system also allows you to conveniently use all Google Fonts with performance and privacy in mind. CSS and font files are downloaded at build time and self-hosted with the rest of your static assets. **No requests are sent to Google by the browser.**\n\n## [Google Fonts](#google-fonts)\n\nAutomatically self-host any Google Font. Fonts are included in the deployment and served from the same domain as your deployment. **No requests are sent to Google by the browser.**\n\nGet started by importing the font you would like to use from `next/font/google` as a function. We recommend using [variable fonts](https://fonts.google.com/variablefonts) for the best performance and flexibility.\n\nTo use the font in all your pages, add it to [`_app.js` file](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/custom-app) under `/pages` as shown below:\n\n```\nimport { Inter } from 'next/font/google'\n \n// If loading a variable font, you don't need to specify the font weight\nconst inter = Inter({ subsets: ['latin'] })\n \nexport default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {\n  return (\n    <main className={inter.className}>\n      <Component {...pageProps} />\n    </main>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nIf you can't use a variable font, you will **need to specify a weight**:\n\n```\nimport { Roboto } from 'next/font/google'\n \nconst roboto = Roboto({\n  weight: '400',\n  subsets: ['latin'],\n})\n \nexport default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {\n  return (\n    <main className={roboto.className}>\n      <Component {...pageProps} />\n    </main>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nYou can specify multiple weights and/or styles by using an array:\n\n```\nconst roboto = Roboto({\n  weight: ['400', '700'],\n  style: ['normal', 'italic'],\n  subsets: ['latin'],\n  display: 'swap',\n})\n```\n\n> **Good to know**: Use an underscore (\\_) for font names with multiple words. E.g. `Roboto Mono` should be imported as `Roboto_Mono`.\n\n### [Apply the font in `<head>`](#apply-the-font-in-head)\n\nYou can also use the font without a wrapper and `className` by injecting it inside the `<head>` as follows:\n\n```\nimport { Inter } from 'next/font/google'\n \nconst inter = Inter({ subsets: ['latin'] })\n \nexport default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <style jsx global>{`\n        html {\n          font-family: ${inter.style.fontFamily};\n        }\n      `}</style>\n      <Component {...pageProps} />\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n### [Single page usage](#single-page-usage)\n\nTo use the font on a single page, add it to the specific page as shown below:\n\n```\nimport { Inter } from 'next/font/google'\n \nconst inter = Inter({ subsets: ['latin'] })\n \nexport default function Home() {\n  return (\n    <div className={inter.className}>\n      <p>Hello World</p>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n### [Specifying a subset](#specifying-a-subset)\n\nGoogle Fonts are automatically [subset](https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/glossary/subsetting). This reduces the size of the font file and improves performance. You'll need to define which of these subsets you want to preload. Failing to specify any subsets while [`preload`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/components/font#preload) is `true` will result in a warning.\n\nThis can be done by adding it to the function call:\n\n```\nconst inter = Inter({ subsets: ['latin'] })\n```\n\nView the [Font API Reference](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/components/font) for more information.\n\n### [Using Multiple Fonts](#using-multiple-fonts)\n\nYou can import and use multiple fonts in your application. There are two approaches you can take.\n\nThe first approach is to create a utility function that exports a font, imports it, and applies its `className` where needed. This ensures the font is preloaded only when it's rendered:\n\n```\nimport { Inter, Roboto_Mono } from 'next/font/google'\n \nexport const inter = Inter({\n  subsets: ['latin'],\n  display: 'swap',\n})\n \nexport const roboto_mono = Roboto_Mono({\n  subsets: ['latin'],\n  display: 'swap',\n})\n```\n\nIn the example above, `Inter` will be applied globally, and `Roboto Mono` can be imported and applied as needed.\n\nAlternatively, you can create a [CSS variable](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/components/font#variable) and use it with your preferred CSS solution:\n\n```\nhtml {\n  font-family: var(--font-inter);\n}\n \nh1 {\n  font-family: var(--font-roboto-mono);\n}\n```\n\nIn the example above, `Inter` will be applied globally, and any `<h1>` tags will be styled with `Roboto Mono`.\n\n> **Recommendation**: Use multiple fonts conservatively since each new font is an additional resource the client has to download.\n\n## [Local Fonts](#local-fonts)\n\nImport `next/font/local` and specify the `src` of your local font file. We recommend using [variable fonts](https://fonts.google.com/variablefonts) for the best performance and flexibility.\n\n```\nimport localFont from 'next/font/local'\n \n// Font files can be colocated inside of `pages`\nconst myFont = localFont({ src: './my-font.woff2' })\n \nexport default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {\n  return (\n    <main className={myFont.className}>\n      <Component {...pageProps} />\n    </main>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nIf you want to use multiple files for a single font family, `src` can be an array:\n\n```\nconst roboto = localFont({\n  src: [\n    {\n      path: './Roboto-Regular.woff2',\n      weight: '400',\n      style: 'normal',\n    },\n    {\n      path: './Roboto-Italic.woff2',\n      weight: '400',\n      style: 'italic',\n    },\n    {\n      path: './Roboto-Bold.woff2',\n      weight: '700',\n      style: 'normal',\n    },\n    {\n      path: './Roboto-BoldItalic.woff2',\n      weight: '700',\n      style: 'italic',\n    },\n  ],\n})\n```\n\nView the [Font API Reference](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/components/font) for more information.\n\n## [With Tailwind CSS](#with-tailwind-css)\n\n`next/font` can be used with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) through a [CSS variable](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/components/font#css-variables).\n\nIn the example below, we use the font `Inter` from `next/font/google` (you can use any font from Google or Local Fonts). Load your font with the `variable` option to define your CSS variable name and assign it to `inter`. Then, use `inter.variable` to add the CSS variable to your HTML document.\n\n```\nimport { Inter } from 'next/font/google'\n \nconst inter = Inter({\n  subsets: ['latin'],\n  variable: '--font-inter',\n})\n \nexport default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {\n  return (\n    <main className={`${inter.variable} font-sans`}>\n      <Component {...pageProps} />\n    </main>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nFinally, add the CSS variable to your [Tailwind CSS config](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/styling/tailwind-css#configuring-tailwind):\n\n```\n/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */\nmodule.exports = {\n  content: [\n    './pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}',\n    './components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}',\n    './app/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}',\n  ],\n  theme: {\n    extend: {\n      fontFamily: {\n        sans: ['var(--font-inter)'],\n        mono: ['var(--font-roboto-mono)'],\n      },\n    },\n  },\n  plugins: [],\n}\n```\n\nYou can now use the `font-sans` and `font-mono` utility classes to apply the font to your elements.\n\n## [Preloading](#preloading)\n\nWhen a font function is called on a page of your site, it is not globally available and preloaded on all routes. Rather, the font is only preloaded on the related route/s based on the type of file where it is used:\n\n*   if it's a [unique page](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts), it is preloaded on the unique route for that page\n*   if it's in the [custom App](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/custom-app), it is preloaded on all the routes of the site under `/pages`\n\n## [Reusing fonts](#reusing-fonts)\n\nEvery time you call the `localFont` or Google font function, that font is hosted as one instance in your application. Therefore, if you load the same font function in multiple files, multiple instances of the same font are hosted. In this situation, it is recommended to do the following:\n\n*   Call the font loader function in one shared file\n*   Export it as a constant\n*   Import the constant in each file where you would like to use this font",

    "markdown": "# Optimizing: Images | Next.js\n\n## Image Optimization\n\nExamples\n\n*   [Image Component](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/image-component)\n\nAccording to [Web Almanac](https://almanac.httparchive.org/), images account for a huge portion of the typical website’s [page weight](https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2022/page-weight#content-type-and-file-formats) and can have a sizable impact on your website's [LCP performance](https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2022/performance#lcp-image-optimization).\n\nThe Next.js Image component extends the HTML `<img>` element with features for automatic image optimization:\n\n*   **Size Optimization:** Automatically serve correctly sized images for each device, using modern image formats like WebP and AVIF.\n*   **Visual Stability:** Prevent [layout shift](https://nextjs.org/learn/seo/web-performance/cls) automatically when images are loading.\n*   **Faster Page Loads:** Images are only loaded when they enter the viewport using native browser lazy loading, with optional blur-up placeholders.\n*   **Asset Flexibility:** On-demand image resizing, even for images stored on remote servers\n\n> **🎥 Watch:** Learn more about how to use `next/image` → [YouTube (9 minutes)](https://youtu.be/IU_qq_c_lKA).\n\n## [Usage](#usage)\n\n```\nimport Image from 'next/image'\n```\n\nYou can then define the `src` for your image (either local or remote).\n\n### [Local Images](#local-images)\n\nTo use a local image, `import` your `.jpg`, `.png`, or `.webp` image files.\n\nNext.js will [automatically determine](#image-sizing) the `width` and `height` of your image based on the imported file. These values are used to prevent [Cumulative Layout Shift](https://nextjs.org/learn/seo/web-performance/cls) while your image is loading.\n\n```\nimport Image from 'next/image'\nimport profilePic from '../public/me.png'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <Image\n      src={profilePic}\n      alt=\"Picture of the author\"\n      // width={500} automatically provided\n      // height={500} automatically provided\n      // blurDataURL=\"data:...\" automatically provided\n      // placeholder=\"blur\" // Optional blur-up while loading\n    />\n  )\n}\n```\n\n> **Warning:** Dynamic `await import()` or `require()` are _not_ supported. The `import` must be static so it can be analyzed at build time.\n\n### [Remote Images](#remote-images)\n\nTo use a remote image, the `src` property should be a URL string.\n\nSince Next.js does not have access to remote files during the build process, you'll need to provide the [`width`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/components/image#width), [`height`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/components/image#height) and optional [`blurDataURL`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/components/image#blurdataurl) props manually.\n\nThe `width` and `height` attributes are used to infer the correct aspect ratio of image and avoid layout shift from the image loading in. The `width` and `height` do _not_ determine the rendered size of the image file. Learn more about [Image Sizing](#image-sizing).\n\n```\nimport Image from 'next/image'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <Image\n      src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/my-bucket/profile.png\"\n      alt=\"Picture of the author\"\n      width={500}\n      height={500}\n    />\n  )\n}\n```\n\nTo safely allow optimizing images, define a list of supported URL patterns in `next.config.js`. Be as specific as possible to prevent malicious usage. For example, the following configuration will only allow images from a specific AWS S3 bucket:\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    remotePatterns: [\n      {\n        protocol: 'https',\n        hostname: 's3.amazonaws.com',\n        port: '',\n        pathname: '/my-bucket/**',\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n}\n```\n\nLearn more about [`remotePatterns`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/components/image#remotepatterns) configuration. If you want to use relative URLs for the image `src`, use a [`loader`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/components/image#loader).\n\n### [Domains](#domains)\n\nSometimes you may want to optimize a remote image, but still use the built-in Next.js Image Optimization API. To do this, leave the `loader` at its default setting and enter an absolute URL for the Image `src` prop.\n\nTo protect your application from malicious users, you must define a list of remote hostnames you intend to use with the `next/image` component.\n\n> Learn more about [`remotePatterns`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/components/image#remotepatterns) configuration.\n\n### [Loaders](#loaders)\n\nNote that in the [example earlier](#local-images), a partial URL (`\"/me.png\"`) is provided for a local image. This is possible because of the loader architecture.\n\nA loader is a function that generates the URLs for your image. It modifies the provided `src`, and generates multiple URLs to request the image at different sizes. These multiple URLs are used in the automatic [srcset](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/HTMLImageElement/srcset) generation, so that visitors to your site will be served an image that is the right size for their viewport.\n\nThe default loader for Next.js applications uses the built-in Image Optimization API, which optimizes images from anywhere on the web, and then serves them directly from the Next.js web server. If you would like to serve your images directly from a CDN or image server, you can write your own loader function with a few lines of JavaScript.\n\nYou can define a loader per-image with the [`loader` prop](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/components/image#loader), or at the application level with the [`loaderFile` configuration](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/components/image#loaderfile).\n\n## [Priority](#priority)\n\nYou should add the `priority` property to the image that will be the [Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) element](https://web.dev/lcp/#what-elements-are-considered) for each page. Doing so allows Next.js to specially prioritize the image for loading (e.g. through preload tags or priority hints), leading to a meaningful boost in LCP.\n\nThe LCP element is typically the largest image or text block visible within the viewport of the page. When you run `next dev`, you'll see a console warning if the LCP element is an `<Image>` without the `priority` property.\n\nOnce you've identified the LCP image, you can add the property like this:\n\n```\nimport Image from 'next/image'\n \nexport default function Home() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h1>My Homepage</h1>\n      <Image\n        src=\"/me.png\"\n        alt=\"Picture of the author\"\n        width={500}\n        height={500}\n        priority\n      />\n      <p>Welcome to my homepage!</p>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nSee more about priority in the [`next/image` component documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/components/image#priority).\n\n## [Image Sizing](#image-sizing)\n\nOne of the ways that images most commonly hurt performance is through _layout shift_, where the image pushes other elements around on the page as it loads in. This performance problem is so annoying to users that it has its own Core Web Vital, called [Cumulative Layout Shift](https://web.dev/cls/). The way to avoid image-based layout shifts is to [always size your images](https://web.dev/optimize-cls/#images-without-dimensions). This allows the browser to reserve precisely enough space for the image before it loads.\n\nBecause `next/image` is designed to guarantee good performance results, it cannot be used in a way that will contribute to layout shift, and **must** be sized in one of three ways:\n\n1.  Automatically, using a [static import](#local-images)\n2.  Explicitly, by including a [`width`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/components/image#width) and [`height`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/components/image#height) property\n3.  Implicitly, by using [fill](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/components/image#fill) which causes the image to expand to fill its parent element.\n\n> **What if I don't know the size of my images?**\n> \n> If you are accessing images from a source without knowledge of the images' sizes, there are several things you can do:\n> \n> **Use `fill`**\n> \n> The [`fill`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/components/image#fill) prop allows your image to be sized by its parent element. Consider using CSS to give the image's parent element space on the page along [`sizes`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/components/image#sizes) prop to match any media query break points. You can also use [`object-fit`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/object-fit) with `fill`, `contain`, or `cover`, and [`object-position`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/object-position) to define how the image should occupy that space.\n> \n> **Normalize your images**\n> \n> If you're serving images from a source that you control, consider modifying your image pipeline to normalize the images to a specific size.\n> \n> **Modify your API calls**\n> \n> If your application is retrieving image URLs using an API call (such as to a CMS), you may be able to modify the API call to return the image dimensions along with the URL.\n\nIf none of the suggested methods works for sizing your images, the `next/image` component is designed to work well on a page alongside standard `<img>` elements.\n\n## [Styling](#styling)\n\nStyling the Image component is similar to styling a normal `<img>` element, but there are a few guidelines to keep in mind:\n\n*   Use `className` or `style`, not `styled-jsx`.\n    *   In most cases, we recommend using the `className` prop. This can be an imported [CSS Module](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/styling/css-modules), a [global stylesheet](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/styling/css-modules#global-styles), etc.\n    *   You can also use the `style` prop to assign inline styles.\n    *   You cannot use [styled-jsx](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/styling/css-in-js) because it's scoped to the current component (unless you mark the style as `global`).\n*   When using `fill`, the parent element must have `position: relative`\n    *   This is necessary for the proper rendering of the image element in that layout mode.\n*   When using `fill`, the parent element must have `display: block`\n    *   This is the default for `<div>` elements but should be specified otherwise.\n\n## [Examples](#examples)\n\n### [Responsive](#responsive)\n\n![Responsive image filling the width and height of its parent container](https://nextjs.org/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs%2Flight%2Fresponsive-image.png&w=3840&q=75)![Responsive image filling the width and height of its parent container](https://nextjs.org/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs%2Fdark%2Fresponsive-image.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\n```\nimport Image from 'next/image'\nimport mountains from '../public/mountains.jpg'\n \nexport default function Responsive() {\n  return (\n    <div style={{ display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column' }}>\n      <Image\n        alt=\"Mountains\"\n        // Importing an image will\n        // automatically set the width and height\n        src={mountains}\n        sizes=\"100vw\"\n        // Make the image display full width\n        style={{\n          width: '100%',\n          height: 'auto',\n        }}\n      />\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n### [Fill Container](#fill-container)\n\n![Grid of images filling parent container width](https://nextjs.org/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs%2Flight%2Ffill-container.png&w=3840&q=75)![Grid of images filling parent container width](https://nextjs.org/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs%2Fdark%2Ffill-container.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\n```\nimport Image from 'next/image'\nimport mountains from '../public/mountains.jpg'\n \nexport default function Fill() {\n  return (\n    <div\n      style={{\n        display: 'grid',\n        gridGap: '8px',\n        gridTemplateColumns: 'repeat(auto-fit, minmax(400px, auto))',\n      }}\n    >\n      <div style={{ position: 'relative', height: '400px' }}>\n        <Image\n          alt=\"Mountains\"\n          src={mountains}\n          fill\n          sizes=\"(min-width: 808px) 50vw, 100vw\"\n          style={{\n            objectFit: 'cover', // cover, contain, none\n          }}\n        />\n      </div>\n      {/* And more images in the grid... */}\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n### [Background Image](#background-image)\n\n![Background image taking full width and height of page](https://nextjs.org/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs%2Flight%2Fbackground-image.png&w=3840&q=75)![Background image taking full width and height of page](https://nextjs.org/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs%2Fdark%2Fbackground-image.png&w=3840&q=75)\n\n```\nimport Image from 'next/image'\nimport mountains from '../public/mountains.jpg'\n \nexport default function Background() {\n  return (\n    <Image\n      alt=\"Mountains\"\n      src={mountains}\n      placeholder=\"blur\"\n      quality={100}\n      fill\n      sizes=\"100vw\"\n      style={{\n        objectFit: 'cover',\n      }}\n    />\n  )\n}\n```\n\nFor examples of the Image component used with the various styles, see the [Image Component Demo](https://image-component.nextjs.gallery/).\n\n## [Other Properties](#other-properties)\n\n[**View all properties available to the `next/image` component.**](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/components/image)\n\n## [Configuration](#configuration)\n\nThe `next/image` component and Next.js Image Optimization API can be configured in the [`next.config.js` file](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js).

    "markdown": "# Optimizing: Scripts | Next.js\n\n## Script Optimization\n\n### [Application Scripts](#application-scripts)\n\nTo load a third-party script for all routes, import `next/script` and include the script directly in your custom `_app`:\n\n```\nimport Script from 'next/script'\n \nexport default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Component {...pageProps} />\n      <Script src=\"https://example.com/script.js\" />\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nThis script will load and execute when _any_ route in your application is accessed. Next.js will ensure the script will **only load once**, even if a user navigates between multiple pages.\n\n> **Recommendation**: We recommend only including third-party scripts in specific pages or layouts in order to minimize any unnecessary impact to performance.\n\n### [Strategy](#strategy)\n\nAlthough the default behavior of `next/script` allows you to load third-party scripts in any page or layout, you can fine-tune its loading behavior by using the `strategy` property:\n\n*   `beforeInteractive`: Load the script before any Next.js code and before any page hydration occurs.\n*   `afterInteractive`: (**default**) Load the script early but after some hydration on the page occurs.\n*   `lazyOnload`: Load the script later during browser idle time.\n*   `worker`: (experimental) Load the script in a web worker.\n\nRefer to the [`next/script`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/components/script#strategy) API reference documentation to learn more about each strategy and their use cases.\n\n### [Offloading Scripts To A Web Worker (Experimental)](#offloading-scripts-to-a-web-worker-experimental)\n\n> **Warning:** The `worker` strategy is not yet stable and does not yet work with the [`app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/defining-routes) directory. Use with caution.\n\nScripts that use the `worker` strategy are offloaded and executed in a web worker with [Partytown](https://partytown.builder.io/). This can improve the performance of your site by dedicating the main thread to the rest of your application code.\n\nThis strategy is still experimental and can only be used if the `nextScriptWorkers` flag is enabled in `next.config.js`:\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  experimental: {\n    nextScriptWorkers: true,\n  },\n}\n```\n\nThen, run `next` (normally `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`) and Next.js will guide you through the installation of the required packages to finish the setup:\n\nYou'll see instructions like these: Please install Partytown by running `npm install @builder.io/partytown`\n\nOnce setup is complete, defining `strategy=\"worker\"` will automatically instantiate Partytown in your application and offload the script to a web worker.\n\n```\nimport Script from 'next/script'\n \nexport default function Home() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Script src=\"https://example.com/script.js\" strategy=\"worker\" />\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nThere are a number of trade-offs that need to be considered when loading a third-party script in a web worker. Please see Partytown's [tradeoffs](https://partytown.builder.io/trade-offs) documentation for more information.\n\n### [Inline Scripts](#inline-scripts)\n\nInline scripts, or scripts not loaded from an external file, are also supported by the Script component. They can be written by placing the JavaScript within curly braces:\n\n```\n<Script id=\"show-banner\">\n  {`document.getElementById('banner').classList.remove('hidden')`}\n</Script>\n```\n\nOr by using the `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` property:\n\n```\n<Script\n  id=\"show-banner\"\n  dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{\n    __html: `document.getElementById('banner').classList.remove('hidden')`,\n  }}\n/>\n```\n\n> **Warning**: An `id` property must be assigned for inline scripts in order for Next.js to track and optimize the script.\n\n### [Executing Additional Code](#executing-additional-code)\n\nEvent handlers can be used with the Script component to execute additional code after a certain event occurs:\n\n*   `onLoad`: Execute code after the script has finished loading.\n*   `onReady`: Execute code after the script has finished loading and every time the component is mounted.\n*   `onError`: Execute code if the script fails to load.\n\nThese handlers will only work when `next/script` is imported and used inside of a [Client Component](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/client-components) where `\"use client\"` is defined as the first line of code:\n\n```\nimport Script from 'next/script'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Script\n        src=\"https://example.com/script.js\"\n        onLoad={() => {\n          console.log('Script has loaded')\n        }}\n      />\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nRefer to the [`next/script`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/components/script#onload) API reference to learn more about each event handler and view examples.\n\n### [Additional Attributes](#additional-attributes)\n\nThere are many DOM attributes that can be assigned to a `<script>` element that are not used by the Script component, like [`nonce`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/nonce) or [custom data attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/data-*). Including any additional attributes will automatically forward it to the final, optimized `<script>` element that is included in the HTML.\n\n```\nimport Script from 'next/script'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Script\n        src=\"https://example.com/script.js\"\n        id=\"example-script\"\n        nonce=\"XUENAJFW\"\n        data-test=\"script\"\n      />\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```",

This guide will cover the optimizations you can leverage to enhance your user experience.\n\n## [Built-in Components](#built-in-components)\n\nBuilt-in components abstract away the complexity of implementing common UI optimizations. These components are:\n\n*   **Images**: Built on the native `<img>` element. The Image Component optimizes images for performance by lazy loading and automatically resizing images based on device size.\n*   **Link**: Built on the native `<a>` tags. The Link Component prefetches pages in the background, for faster and smoother page transitions.\n*   **Scripts**: Built on the native `<script>` tags. The Script Component gives you control over loading and execution of third-party scripts.\n\nMetadata helps search engines understand your content better (which can result in better SEO), and allows you to customize how your content is presented on social media, helping you create a more engaging and consistent user experience across various platforms.\n\nThe Head Component in Next.js allows you to modify the `<head>` of a page. Learn more in the [Head Component](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/components/head) documentation.\n\n## [Static Assets](#static-assets)\n\nNext.js `/public` folder can be used to serve static assets like images, fonts, and other files. Files inside `/public` can also be cached by CDN providers so that they are delivered efficiently.\n\n## [Analytics and Monitoring](#analytics-and-monitoring)\n\nFor large applications, Next.js integrates with popular analytics and monitoring tools to help you understand how your application is performing. Learn more in the [Analytics](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/analytics), [OpenTelemetry](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/open-telemetry), and [Instrumentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/instrumentation) guides.",

    "markdown": "# Building Your Application: Testing | Next.js\n\nIn React and Next.js, there are a few different types of tests you can write, each with its own purpose and use cases. This page provides an overview of types and commonly used tools you can use to test your application.\n\n## [Types of tests](#types-of-tests)\n\n*   **Unit testing** involves testing individual units (or blocks of code) in isolation. In React, a unit can be a single function, hook, or component.\n    *   **Component testing** is a more focused version of unit testing where the primary subject of the tests is React components. This may involve testing how components are rendered, their interaction with props, and their behavior in response to user events.\n    *   **Integration testing** involves testing how multiple units work together. This can be a combination of components, hooks, and functions.\n*   **End-to-End (E2E) Testing** involves testing user flows in an environment that simulates real user scenarios, like the browser. This means testing specific tasks (e.g. signup flow) in a production-like environment.\n*   **Snapshot testing** involves capturing the rendered output of a component and saving it to a snapshot file. When tests run, the current rendered output of the component is compared against the saved snapshot. Changes in the snapshot are used to indicate unexpected changes in behavior.\n\n## [Guides](#guides)\n\nSee the guides below to learn how to set up Next.js with these commonly used testing tools:",

This guide will show you how to setup Vitest with Next.js and write your first tests.\n\n> **Good to know:** Since `async` Server Components are new to the React ecosystem, Vitest currently does not support them. While you can still run **unit tests** for synchronous Server and Client Components, we recommend using an **E2E tests** for `async` components.\n\n## [Quickstart](#quickstart)\n\nYou can use `create-next-app` with the Next.js [with-vitest](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-vitest) example to quickly get started:\n\n```\nnpx create-next-app@latest --example with-vitest with-vitest-app\n```\n\n## [Manual Setup](#manual-setup)\n\nTo manually set up Vitest, install `vitest` and the following packages as dev dependencies:\n\n```\nnpm install -D vitest @vitejs/plugin-react jsdom @testing-library/react\n# or\nyarn add -D vitest @vitejs/plugin-react jsdom @testing-library/react\n# or\npnpm install -D vitest @vitejs/plugin-react jsdom @testing-library/react\n# or\nbun add -D vitest @vitejs/plugin-react jsdom @testing-library/react\n```\n\nCreate a `vitest.config.ts|js` file in the root of your project, and add the following options:\n\n```\nimport { defineConfig } from 'vitest/config'\nimport react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'\n \nexport default defineConfig({\n  plugins: [react()],\n  test: {\n    environment: 'jsdom',\n  },\n})\n```\n\nFor more information on configuring Vitest, please refer to the [Vitest Configuration](https://vitest.dev/config/#configuration) docs.\n\nThen, add a `test` script to your `package.json`:\n\n```\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"dev\": \"next dev\",\n    \"build\": \"next build\",\n    \"start\": \"next start\",\n    \"test\": \"vitest\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWhen you run `npm run test`, Vitest will **watch** for changes in your project by default.\n\n## [Creating your first Vitest Unit Test](#creating-your-first-vitest-unit-test)\n\nCheck that everything is working by creating a test to check if the `<Page />` component successfully renders a heading:\n\n```\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Home</h1>\n      <Link href=\"/about\">About</Link>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```\nimport { expect, test } from 'vitest'\nimport { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react'\nimport Page from '../pages/index'\n \ntest('Page', () => {\n  render(<Page />)\n  expect(screen.getByRole('heading', { level: 1, name: 'Home' })).toBeDefined()\n})\n```\n\n## [Running your tests](#running-your-tests)\n\nThen, run the following command to run your tests:\n\n```\nnpm run test\n# or\nyarn test\n# or\npnpm test\n# or\nbun test\n```\n\n## [Additional Resources](#additional-resources)\n\nYou may find these resources helpful:\n\n*   [Next.js with Vitest example](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-vitest)\n*   [Vitest Docs](https://vitest.dev/guide/)\n*   [React Testing Library Docs](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/)",

You can either use the `useReportWebVitals` hook to manage reporting yourself, or alternatively, Vercel provides a [managed service](https://vercel.com/analytics?utm_source=next-site&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=next-website) to automatically collect and visualize metrics for you.\n\n## [Build Your Own](#build-your-own)\n\n```\nimport { useReportWebVitals } from 'next/web-vitals'\n \nfunction MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {\n  useReportWebVitals((metric) => {\n    console.log(metric)\n  })\n \n  return <Component {...pageProps} />\n}\n```\n\nView the [API Reference](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/use-report-web-vitals) for more information.\n\n## [Web Vitals](#web-vitals)\n\n[Web Vitals](https://web.dev/vitals/) are a set of useful metrics that aim to capture the user experience of a web page. The following web vitals are all included:\n\n*   [Time to First Byte](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Glossary/Time_to_first_byte) (TTFB)\n*   [First Contentful Paint](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Glossary/First_contentful_paint) (FCP)\n*   [Largest Contentful Paint](https://web.dev/lcp/) (LCP)\n*   [First Input Delay](https://web.dev/fid/) (FID)\n*   [Cumulative Layout Shift](https://web.dev/cls/) (CLS)\n*   [Interaction to Next Paint](https://web.dev/inp/) (INP)\n\nYou can handle all the results of these metrics using the `name` property.\n\n```\nimport { useReportWebVitals } from 'next/web-vitals'\n \nfunction MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {\n  useReportWebVitals((metric) => {\n    switch (metric.name) {\n      case 'FCP': {\n        // handle FCP results\n      }\n      case 'LCP': {\n        // handle LCP results\n      }\n      // ...\n    }\n  })\n \n  return <Component {...pageProps} />\n}\n```\n\n## [Custom Metrics](#custom-metrics)\n\nIn addition to the core metrics listed above, there are some additional custom metrics that measure the time it takes for the page to hydrate and render:\n\n*   `Next.js-hydration`: Length of time it takes for the page to start and finish hydrating (in ms)\n*   `Next.js-route-change-to-render`: Length of time it takes for a page to start rendering after a route change (in ms)\n*   `Next.js-render`: Length of time it takes for a page to finish render after a route change (in ms)\n\nYou can handle all the results of these metrics separately:\n\n```\nexport function reportWebVitals(metric) {\n  switch (metric.name) {\n    case 'Next.js-hydration':\n      // handle hydration results\n      break\n    case 'Next.js-route-change-to-render':\n      // handle route-change to render results\n      break\n    case 'Next.js-render':\n      // handle render results\n      break\n    default:\n      break\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThese metrics work in all browsers that support the [User Timing API](https://caniuse.com/#feat=user-timing).\n\n## [Sending results to external systems](#sending-results-to-external-systems)\n\nYou can send results to any endpoint to measure and track real user performance on your site. For example:\n\n```\nuseReportWebVitals((metric) => {\n  const body = JSON.stringify(metric)\n  const url = 'https://example.com/analytics'\n \n  // Use `navigator.sendBeacon()` if available, falling back to `fetch()`.\n  if (navigator.sendBeacon) {\n    navigator.sendBeacon(url, body)\n  } else {\n    fetch(url, { body, method: 'POST', keepalive: true })\n  }\n})\n```\n\n> **Good to know**: If you use [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/), using the `id` value can allow you to construct metric distributions manually (to calculate percentiles, etc.)\n\n> ```\n> useReportWebVitals((metric) => {\n>   // Use `window.gtag` if you initialized Google Analytics as this example:\n>   // https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/examples/with-google-analytics/pages/_app.js\n>   window.gtag('event', metric.name, {\n>     value: Math.round(\n>       metric.name === 'CLS' ? metric.value * 1000 : metric.value\n>     ), // values must be integers\n>     event_label: metric.id, // id unique to current page load\n>     non_interaction: true, // avoids affecting bounce rate.\n>   })\n> })\n> ```\n> \n> Read more about [sending results to Google Analytics](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/web-vitals#send-the-results-to-google-analytics).",

    "markdown": "# Optimizing: Instrumentation | Next.js\n\nInstrumentation is the process of using code to integrate monitoring and logging tools into your application. This allows you to track the performance and behavior of your application, and to debug issues in production.\n\n## [Convention](#convention)\n\nTo set up instrumentation, create `instrumentation.ts|js` file in the **root directory** of your project (or inside the [`src`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/src-directory) folder if using one).\n\nThen, export a `register` function in the file. This function will be called **once** when a new Next.js server instance is initiated.\n\nFor example, to use Next.js with [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) and [@vercel/otel](https://vercel.com/docs/observability/otel-overview):\n\n```\nimport { registerOTel } from '@vercel/otel'\n \nexport function register() {\n  registerOTel('next-app')\n}\n```\n\nSee the [Next.js with OpenTelemetry example](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-opentelemetry) for a complete implementation.\n\n> **Good to know**\n> \n> *   This feature is **experimental**. To use it, you must explicitly opt in by defining [`experimental.instrumentationHook = true;`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/instrumentationHook) in your `next.config.js`.\n> *   The `instrumentation` file should be in the root of your project and not inside the `app` or `pages` directory. If you're using the `src` folder, then place the file inside `src` alongside `pages` and `app`.\n> *   If you use the [`pageExtensions` config option](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/pageExtensions) to add a suffix, you will also need to update the `instrumentation` filename to match.\n\n## [Examples](#examples)\n\n### [Importing files with side effects](#importing-files-with-side-effects)\n\nSometimes, it may be useful to import a file in your code because of the side effects it will cause. For example, you might import a file that defines a set of global variables, but never explicitly use the imported file in your code. You would still have access to the global variables the package has declared.\n\nWe recommend importing files using JavaScript `import` syntax within your `register` function. The following example demonstrates a basic usage of `import` in a `register` function:\n\n```\nexport async function register() {\n  await import('package-with-side-effect')\n}\n```\n\n> **Good to know:**\n> \n> We recommend importing the file from within the `register` function, rather than at the top of the file. By doing this, you can colocate all of your side effects in one place in your code, and avoid any unintended consequences from importing globally at the top of the file.\n\n### [Importing runtime-specific code](#importing-runtime-specific-code)\n\nNext.js calls `register` in all environments, so it's important to conditionally import any code that doesn't support specific runtimes (e.g. [Edge](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/edge-and-nodejs-runtimes#edge-runtime) or [Node.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/edge-and-nodejs-runtimes#nodejs-runtime)). You can use the `NEXT_RUNTIME` environment variable to get the current environment:\n\n```\nexport async function register() {\n  if (process.env.NEXT_RUNTIME === 'nodejs') {\n    await import('./instrumentation-node')\n  }\n \n  if (process.env.NEXT_RUNTIME === 'edge') {\n    await import('./instrumentation-edge')\n  }\n}\n```",

    "markdown": "# Optimizing: Lazy Loading | Next.js\n\n[Lazy loading](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Performance/Lazy_loading) in Next.js helps improve the initial loading performance of an application by decreasing the amount of JavaScript needed to render a route.\n\nIt allows you to defer loading of **Client Components** and imported libraries, and only include them in the client bundle when they're needed. For example, you might want to defer loading a modal until a user clicks to open it.\n\nThere are two ways you can implement lazy loading in Next.js:\n\n1.  Using [Dynamic Imports](#nextdynamic) with `next/dynamic`\n2.  Using [`React.lazy()`](https://react.dev/reference/react/lazy) with [Suspense](https://react.dev/reference/react/Suspense)\n\nBy default, Server Components are automatically [code split](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Glossary/Code_splitting), and you can use [streaming](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/loading-ui-and-streaming) to progressively send pieces of UI from the server to the client. Lazy loading applies to Client Components.\n\n## [`next/dynamic`](#nextdynamic)\n\n`next/dynamic` is a composite of [`React.lazy()`](https://react.dev/reference/react/lazy) and [Suspense](https://react.dev/reference/react/Suspense). It behaves the same way in the `app` and `pages` directories to allow for incremental migration.\n\n## [Examples](#examples)\n\nBy using `next/dynamic`, the header component will not be included in the page's initial JavaScript bundle. The page will render the Suspense `fallback` first, followed by the `Header` component when the `Suspense` boundary is resolved.\n\n```\nimport dynamic from 'next/dynamic'\n \nconst DynamicHeader = dynamic(() => import('../components/header'), {\n  loading: () => <p>Loading...</p>,\n})\n \nexport default function Home() {\n  return <DynamicHeader />\n}\n```\n\n> **Good to know**: In `import('path/to/component')`, the path must be explicitly written. It can't be a template string nor a variable. Furthermore the `import()` has to be inside the `dynamic()` call for Next.js to be able to match webpack bundles / module ids to the specific `dynamic()` call and preload them before rendering. `dynamic()` can't be used inside of React rendering as it needs to be marked in the top level of the module for preloading to work, similar to `React.lazy`.\n\n## [With named exports](#with-named-exports)\n\nTo dynamically import a named export, you can return it from the [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) returned by [`import()`](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-dynamic-import#example):\n\n```\nexport function Hello() {\n  return <p>Hello!</p>\n}\n \n// pages/index.js\nimport dynamic from 'next/dynamic'\n \nconst DynamicComponent = dynamic(() =>\n  import('../components/hello').then((mod) => mod.Hello)\n)\n```\n\n## [With no SSR](#with-no-ssr)\n\nTo dynamically load a component on the client side, you can use the `ssr` option to disable server-rendering. This is useful if an external dependency or component relies on browser APIs like `window`.\n\n```\nimport dynamic from 'next/dynamic'\n \nconst DynamicHeader = dynamic(() => import('../components/header'), {\n  ssr: false,\n})\n```\n\n## [With external libraries](#with-external-libraries)\n\nThis example uses the external library `fuse.js` for fuzzy search. The module is only loaded in the browser after the user types in the search input.\n\n```\nimport { useState } from 'react'\n \nconst names = ['Tim', 'Joe', 'Bel', 'Lee']\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  const [results, setResults] = useState()\n \n  return (\n    <div>\n      <input\n        type=\"text\"\n        placeholder=\"Search\"\n        onChange={async (e) => {\n          const { value } = e.currentTarget\n          // Dynamically load fuse.js\n          const Fuse = (await import('fuse.js')).default\n          const fuse = new Fuse(names)\n \n          setResults(fuse.search(value))\n        }}\n      />\n      <pre>Results: {JSON.stringify(results, null, 2)}</pre>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```",

This transformer has all the necessary configuration options for Jest to work with Next.js:\n\n```\nimport type { Config } from 'jest'\nimport nextJest from 'next/jest.js'\n \nconst createJestConfig = nextJest({\n  // Provide the path to your Next.js app to load next.config.js and .env files in your test environment\n  dir: './',\n})\n \n// Add any custom config to be passed to Jest\nconst config: Config = {\n  coverageProvider: 'v8',\n  testEnvironment: 'jsdom',\n  // Add more setup options before each test is run\n  // setupFilesAfterEnv: ['<rootDir>/jest.setup.ts'],\n}\n \n// createJestConfig is exported this way to ensure that next/jest can load the Next.js config which is async\nexport default createJestConfig(config)\n```\n\nUnder the hood, `next/jest` is automatically configuring Jest for you, including:\n\n*   Setting up `transform` using the [Next.js Compiler](https://nextjs.org/docs/architecture/nextjs-compiler)\n*   Auto mocking stylesheets (`.css`, `.module.css`, and their scss variants), image imports and [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts)\n*   Loading `.env` (and all variants) into `process.env`\n*   Ignoring `node_modules` from test resolving and transforms\n*   Ignoring `.next` from test resolving\n*   Loading `next.config.js` for flags that enable SWC transforms\n\n> **Good to know**: To test environment variables directly, load them manually in a separate setup script or in your `jest.config.ts` file. For more information, please see [Test Environment Variables](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/environment-variables#test-environment-variables).\n\n## [Setting up Jest (with Babel)](#setting-up-jest-with-babel)\n\nIf you opt out of the [Next.js Compiler](https://nextjs.org/docs/architecture/nextjs-compiler) and use Babel instead, you will need to manually configure Jest and install `babel-jest` and `identity-obj-proxy` in addition to the packages above.\n\nHere are the recommended options to configure Jest for Next.js:\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  collectCoverage: true,\n  // on node 14.x coverage provider v8 offers good speed and more or less good report\n  coverageProvider: 'v8',\n  collectCoverageFrom: [\n    '**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}',\n    '!**/*.d.ts',\n    '!**/node_modules/**',\n    '!<rootDir>/out/**',\n    '!<rootDir>/.next/**',\n    '!<rootDir>/*.config.js',\n    '!<rootDir>/coverage/**',\n  ],\n  moduleNameMapper: {\n    // Handle CSS imports (with CSS modules)\n    // https://jestjs.io/docs/webpack#mocking-css-modules\n    '^.+\\\\.module\\\\.(css|sass|scss)$': 'identity-obj-proxy',\n \n    // Handle CSS imports (without CSS modules)\n    '^.+\\\\.(css|sass|scss)$': '<rootDir>/__mocks__/styleMock.js',\n \n    // Handle image imports\n    // https://jestjs.io/docs/webpack#handling-static-assets\n    '^.+\\\\.(png|jpg|jpeg|gif|webp|avif|ico|bmp|svg)$/i': `<rootDir>/__mocks__/fileMock.js`,\n \n    // Handle module aliases\n    '^@/components/(.*)$': '<rootDir>/components/$1',\n \n    // Handle @next/font\n    '@next/font/(.*)': `<rootDir>/__mocks__/nextFontMock.js`,\n    // Handle next/font\n    'next/font/(.*)': `<rootDir>/__mocks__/nextFontMock.js`,\n    // Disable server-only\n    'server-only': `<rootDir>/__mocks__/empty.js`,\n  },\n  // Add more setup options before each test is run\n  // setupFilesAfterEnv: ['<rootDir>/jest.setup.js'],\n  testPathIgnorePatterns: ['<rootDir>/node_modules/', '<rootDir>/.next/'],\n  testEnvironment: 'jsdom',\n  transform: {\n    // Use babel-jest to transpile tests with the next/babel preset\n    // https://jestjs.io/docs/configuration#transform-objectstring-pathtotransformer--pathtotransformer-object\n    '^.+\\\\.(js|jsx|ts|tsx)$': ['babel-jest', { presets: ['next/babel'] }],\n  },\n  transformIgnorePatterns: [\n    '/node_modules/',\n    '^.+\\\\.module\\\\.(css|sass|scss)$',\n  ],\n}\n```\n\nYou can learn more about each configuration option in the [Jest docs](https://jestjs.io/docs/configuration). We also recommend reviewing [`next/jest` configuration](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/e02fe314dcd0ae614c65b505c6daafbdeebb920e/packages/next/src/build/jest/jest.ts) to see how Next.js configures Jest.\n\n### [Handling stylesheets and image imports](#handling-stylesheets-and-image-imports)\n\nStylesheets and images aren't used in the tests but importing them may cause errors, so they will need to be mocked.\n\nCreate the mock files referenced in the configuration above - `fileMock.js` and `styleMock.js` - inside a `__mocks__` directory:\n\n```\nmodule.exports = 'test-file-stub'\n```\n\nFor more information on handling static assets, please refer to the [Jest Docs](https://jestjs.io/docs/webpack#handling-static-assets).\n\n## [Handling Fonts](#handling-fonts)\n\nTo handle fonts, create the `nextFontMock.js` file inside the `__mocks__` directory, and add the following configuration:\n\n```\nmodule.exports = new Proxy(\n  {},\n  {\n    get: function getter() {\n      return () => ({\n        className: 'className',\n        variable: 'variable',\n        style: { fontFamily: 'fontFamily' },\n      })\n    },\n  }\n)\n```\n\n## [Optional: Handling Absolute Imports and Module Path Aliases](#optional-handling-absolute-imports-and-module-path-aliases)\n\nIf your project is using [Module Path Aliases](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/absolute-imports-and-module-aliases), you will need to configure Jest to resolve the imports by matching the paths option in the `jsconfig.json` file with the `moduleNameMapper` option in the `jest.config.js` file. For example:\n\n```\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"module\": \"esnext\",\n    \"moduleResolution\": \"bundler\",\n    \"baseUrl\": \"./\",\n    \"paths\": {\n      \"@/components/*\": [\"components/*\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n```\nmoduleNameMapper: {\n  // ...\n  '^@/components/(.*)$': '<rootDir>/components/$1',\n}\n```\n\n## [Optional: Extend Jest with custom matchers](#optional-extend-jest-with-custom-matchers)\n\n`@testing-library/jest-dom` includes a set of convenient [custom matchers](https://github.com/testing-library/jest-dom#custom-matchers) such as `.toBeInTheDocument()` making it easier to write tests. You can import the custom matchers for every test by adding the following option to the Jest configuration file:\n\n```\nsetupFilesAfterEnv: ['<rootDir>/jest.setup.ts']\n```\n\nThen, inside `jest.setup.ts`, add the following import:\n\n```\nimport '@testing-library/jest-dom'\n```\n\n> **Good to know:**[`extend-expect` was removed in `v6.0`](https://github.com/testing-library/jest-dom/releases/tag/v6.0.0), so if you are using `@testing-library/jest-dom` before version 6, you will need to import `@testing-library/jest-dom/extend-expect` instead.\n\nIf you need to add more setup options before each test, you can add them to the `jest.setup.js` file above.\n\n## [Add a test script to `package.json`:](#add-a-test-script-to-packagejson)\n\nFinally, add a Jest `test` script to your `package.json` file:\n\n```\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"dev\": \"next dev\",\n    \"build\": \"next build\",\n    \"start\": \"next start\",\n    \"test\": \"jest\",\n    \"test:watch\": \"jest --watch\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n`jest --watch` will re-run tests when a file is changed. For more Jest CLI options, please refer to the [Jest Docs](https://jestjs.io/docs/cli#reference).\n\n### [Creating your first test:](#creating-your-first-test)\n\nYour project is now ready to run tests. Create a folder called `__tests__` in your project's root directory.\n\nFor example, we can add a test to check if the `<Home />` component successfully renders a heading:\n\n```\nexport default function Home() {\n  return <h1>Home</h1>\n}\n```\n\n```\nimport '@testing-library/jest-dom'\nimport { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react'\nimport Home from '../pages/index'\n \ndescribe('Home', () => {\n  it('renders a heading', () => {\n    render(<Home />)\n \n    const heading = screen.getByRole('heading', { level: 1 })\n \n    expect(heading).toBeInTheDocument()\n  })\n})\n```\n\nOptionally, add a [snapshot test](https://jestjs.io/docs/snapshot-testing) to keep track of any unexpected changes in your component:\n\n```\nimport { render } from '@testing-library/react'\nimport Home from '../pages/index'\n \nit('renders homepage unchanged', () => {\n  const { container } = render(<Home />)\n  expect(container).toMatchSnapshot()\n})\n```\n\n> **Good to know**: Test files should not be included inside the Pages Router because any files inside the Pages Router are considered routes.\n\n## [Running your tests](#running-your-tests)\n\nThen, run the following command to run your tests:\n\n```\nnpm run test\n# or\nyarn test\n# or\npnpm test\n```\n\n## [Additional Resources](#additional-resources)\n\nFor further reading, you may find these resources helpful:\n\n*   [Next.js with Jest example](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-jest)\n*   [Jest Docs](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started)\n*   [React Testing Library Docs](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/)\n*   [Testing Playground](https://testing-playground.com/) - use good testing practices to match elements.",

    "markdown": "# Testing: Playwright | Next.js\n\n## Setting up Playwright with Next.js\n\nPlaywright is a testing framework that lets you automate Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit with a single API. You can use it to write **End-to-End (E2E)** testing. This guide will show you how to set up Playwright with Next.js and write your first tests.\n\n## [Quickstart](#quickstart)\n\nThe fastest way to get started is to use `create-next-app` with the [with-playwright example](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-playwright). This will create a Next.js project complete with Playwright configured.\n\n```\nnpx create-next-app@latest --example with-playwright with-playwright-app\n```\n\n## [Manual setup](#manual-setup)\n\nTo install Playwright, run the following command:\n\n```\nnpm init playwright\n# or\nyarn create playwright\n# or\npnpm create playwright\n```\n\nThis will take you through a series of prompts to setup and configure Playwright for your project, including adding a `playwright.config.ts` file. Please refer to the [Playwright installation guide](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro#installation) for the step-by-step guide.\n\n## [Creating your first Playwright E2E test](#creating-your-first-playwright-e2e-test)\n\nCreate two new Next.js pages:\n\n```\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n \nexport default function Home() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Home</h1>\n      <Link href=\"/about\">About</Link>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n \nexport default function About() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>About</h1>\n      <Link href=\"/\">Home</Link>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nThen, add a test to verify that your navigation is working correctly:\n\n```\nimport { test, expect } from '@playwright/test'\n \ntest('should navigate to the about page', async ({ page }) => {\n  // Start from the index page (the baseURL is set via the webServer in the playwright.config.ts)\n  await page.goto('http://localhost:3000/')\n  // Find an element with the text 'About' and click on it\n  await page.click('text=About')\n  // The new URL should be \"/about\" (baseURL is used there)\n  await expect(page).toHaveURL('http://localhost:3000/about')\n  // The new page should contain an h1 with \"About\"\n  await expect(page.locator('h1')).toContainText('About')\n})\n```\n\n> **Good to know**:\n> \n> You can use `page.goto(\"/\")` instead of `page.goto(\"http://localhost:3000/\")`, if you add [`\"baseURL\": \"http://localhost:3000\"`](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-testoptions#test-options-base-url) to the `playwright.config.ts` [configuration file](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-configuration).\n\n### [Running your Playwright tests](#running-your-playwright-tests)\n\nPlaywright will simulate a user navigating your application using three browsers: Chromium, Firefox and Webkit, this requires your Next.js server to be running. We recommend running your tests against your production code to more closely resemble how your application will behave.\n\nRun `npm run build` and `npm run start`, then run `npx playwright test` in another terminal window to run the Playwright tests.\n\n> **Good to know**: Alternatively, you can use the [`webServer`](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-webserver/) feature to let Playwright start the development server and wait until it's fully available.\n\n### [Running Playwright on Continuous Integration (CI)](#running-playwright-on-continuous-integration-ci)\n\nPlaywright will by default run your tests in the [headless mode](https://playwright.dev/docs/ci#running-headed). To install all the Playwright dependencies, run `npx playwright install-deps`.\n\nYou can learn more about Playwright and Continuous Integration from these resources:\n\n*   [Next.js with Playwright example](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-playwright)\n*   [Playwright on your CI provider](https://playwright.dev/docs/ci)\n*   [Playwright Discord](https://discord.com/invite/playwright-807756831384403968)",

    "markdown": "# Configuring: TypeScript | Next.js\n\nNext.js provides a TypeScript-first development experience for building your React application.\n\nIt comes with built-in TypeScript support for automatically installing the necessary packages and configuring the proper settings.\n\n## [New Projects](#new-projects)\n\n`create-next-app` now ships with TypeScript by default.\n\n```\nnpx create-next-app@latest\n```\n\n## [Existing Projects](#existing-projects)\n\nAdd TypeScript to your project by renaming a file to `.ts` / `.tsx`. Run `next dev` and `next build` to automatically install the necessary dependencies and add a `tsconfig.json` file with the recommended config options.\n\nIf you already had a `jsconfig.json` file, copy the `paths` compiler option from the old `jsconfig.json` into the new `tsconfig.json` file, and delete the old `jsconfig.json` file.\n\n## [Minimum TypeScript Version](#minimum-typescript-version)\n\nIt is highly recommended to be on at least `v4.5.2` of TypeScript to get syntax features such as [type modifiers on import names](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-5/#type-on-import-names) and [performance improvements](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-5/#real-path-sync-native).\n\n## [Static Generation and Server-side Rendering](#static-generation-and-server-side-rendering)\n\nFor [`getStaticProps`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/get-static-props), [`getStaticPaths`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/get-static-paths), and [`getServerSideProps`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/get-server-side-props), you can use the `GetStaticProps`, `GetStaticPaths`, and `GetServerSideProps` types respectively:\n\n```\nimport { GetStaticProps, GetStaticPaths, GetServerSideProps } from 'next'\n \nexport const getStaticProps = (async (context) => {\n  // ...\n}) satisfies GetStaticProps\n \nexport const getStaticPaths = (async () => {\n  // ...\n}) satisfies GetStaticPaths\n \nexport const getServerSideProps = (async (context) => {\n  // ...\n}) satisfies GetServerSideProps\n```\n\n> **Good to know:** `satisfies` was added to TypeScript in [4.9](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-4-9.html). We recommend upgrading to the latest version of TypeScript.\n\n## [API Routes](#api-routes)\n\nThe following is an example of how to use the built-in types for API routes:\n\n```\nimport type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next'\n \nexport default function handler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {\n  res.status(200).json({ name: 'John Doe' })\n}\n```\n\nYou can also type the response data:\n\n```\nimport type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next'\n \ntype Data = {\n  name: string\n}\n \nexport default function handler(\n  req: NextApiRequest,\n  res: NextApiResponse<Data>\n) {\n  res.status(200).json({ name: 'John Doe' })\n}\n```\n\n## [Custom `App`](#custom-app)\n\nIf you have a [custom `App`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/custom-app), you can use the built-in type `AppProps` and change file name to `./pages/_app.tsx` like so:\n\n```\nimport type { AppProps } from 'next/app'\n \nexport default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {\n  return <Component {...pageProps} />\n}\n```\n\n## [Path aliases and baseUrl](#path-aliases-and-baseurl)\n\nNext.js automatically supports the `tsconfig.json` `\"paths\"` and `\"baseUrl\"` options.\n\nYou can learn more about this feature on the [Module Path aliases documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/absolute-imports-and-module-aliases).\n\n## [Type checking next.config.js](#type-checking-nextconfigjs)\n\nThe `next.config.js` file must be a JavaScript file as it does not get parsed by Babel or TypeScript, however you can add some type checking in your IDE using JSDoc as below:\n\n```\n// @ts-check\n \n/**\n * @type {import('next').NextConfig}\n **/\nconst nextConfig = {\n  /* config options here */\n}\n \nmodule.exports = nextConfig\n```\n\n## [Incremental type checking](#incremental-type-checking)\n\nSince `v10.2.1` Next.js supports [incremental type checking](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#incremental) when enabled in your `tsconfig.json`, this can help speed up type checking in larger applications.\n\n## [Ignoring TypeScript Errors](#ignoring-typescript-errors)\n\nNext.js fails your **production build** (`next build`) when TypeScript errors are present in your project.\n\nIf you'd like Next.js to dangerously produce production code even when your application has errors, you can disable the built-in type checking step.\n\nIf disabled, be sure you are running type checks as part of your build or deploy process, otherwise this can be very dangerous.\n\nOpen `next.config.js` and enable the `ignoreBuildErrors` option in the `typescript` config:\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  typescript: {\n    // !! WARN !!\n    // Dangerously allow production builds to successfully complete even if\n    // your project has type errors.\n    // !! WARN !!\n    ignoreBuildErrors: true,\n  },\n}\n```\n\n## [Custom Type Declarations](#custom-type-declarations)\n\nWhen you need to declare custom types, you might be tempted to modify `next-env.d.ts`. However, this file is automatically generated, so any changes you make will be overwritten. Instead, you should create a new file, let's call it `new-types.d.ts`, and reference it in your `tsconfig.json`:\n\n```\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"skipLibCheck\": true\n    //...truncated...\n  },\n  \"include\": [\n    \"new-types.d.ts\",\n    \"next-env.d.ts\",\n    \".next/types/**/*.ts\",\n    \"**/*.ts\",\n    \"**/*.tsx\"\n  ],\n  \"exclude\": [\"node_modules\"]\n}\n```\n\n## [Version Changes](#version-changes)\n\n| Version | Changes |\n| --- | --- |\n| `v13.2.0` | Statically typed links are available in beta. |\n| `v12.0.0` | [SWC](https://nextjs.org/docs/architecture/nextjs-compiler) is now used by default to compile TypeScript and TSX for faster builds. |\n| `v10.2.1` | [Incremental type checking](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#incremental) support added when enabled in your `tsconfig.json`. |",

This page will show you how to set up Cypress with Next.js and write your first tests.\n\n> **Warning:**\n> \n> *   For **component testing**, Cypress currently does not support [Next.js version 14](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/28185) and `async` Server Components. These issues are being tracked. For now, component testing works with Next.js version 13, and we recommend E2E testing for `async` Server Components.\n> *   Cypress currently does not support [TypeScript version 5](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/27731) with `moduleResolution:\"bundler\"`. This issue is being tracked.\n\n## [Manual setup](#manual-setup)\n\nTo manually set up Cypress, install `cypress` as a dev dependency:\n\n```\nnpm install -D cypress\n# or\nyarn add -D cypress\n# or\npnpm install -D cypress\n```\n\nAdd the Cypress `open` command to the `package.json` scripts field:\n\n```\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"dev\": \"next dev\",\n    \"build\": \"next build\",\n    \"start\": \"next start\",\n    \"lint\": \"next lint\",\n    \"cypress:open\": \"cypress open\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nRun Cypress for the first time to open the Cypress testing suite:\n\nYou can choose to configure **E2E Testing** and/or **Component Testing**. Selecting any of these options will automatically create a `cypress.config.js` file and a `cypress` folder in your project.\n\n## [Creating your first Cypress E2E test](#creating-your-first-cypress-e2e-test)\n\nEnsure your `cypress.config.js` file has the following configuration:\n\n```\nimport { defineConfig } from 'cypress'\n \nexport default defineConfig({\n  e2e: {\n    setupNodeEvents(on, config) {},\n  },\n})\n```\n\n```\nconst { defineConfig } = require('cypress')\n \nmodule.exports = defineConfig({\n  e2e: {\n    setupNodeEvents(on, config) {},\n  },\n})\n```\n\nThen, create two new Next.js files:\n\n```\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n \nexport default function Home() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Home</h1>\n      <Link href=\"/about\">About</Link>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n \nexport default function About() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>About</h1>\n      <Link href=\"/\">Home</Link>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nAdd a test to check your navigation is working correctly:\n\n```\ndescribe('Navigation', () => {\n  it('should navigate to the about page', () => {\n    // Start from the index page\n    cy.visit('http://localhost:3000/')\n \n    // Find a link with an href attribute containing \"about\" and click it\n    cy.get('a[href*=\"about\"]').click()\n \n    // The new url should include \"/about\"\n    cy.url().should('include', '/about')\n \n    // The new page should contain an h1 with \"About\"\n    cy.get('h1').contains('About')\n  })\n})\n```\n\n### [Running E2E Tests](#running-e2e-tests)\n\nCypress will simulate a user navigating your application, this requires your Next.js server to be running. We recommend running your tests against your production code to more closely resemble how your application will behave.\n\nRun `npm run build && npm run start` to build your Next.js application, then run `npm run cypress:open` in another terminal window to start Cypress and run your E2E testing suite.\n\n> **Good to know:**\n> \n> *   You can use `cy.visit(\"/\")` instead of `cy.visit(\"http://localhost:3000/\")` by adding `baseUrl: 'http://localhost:3000'` to the `cypress.config.js` configuration file.\n> *   Alternatively, you can install the `start-server-and-test` package to run the Next.js production server in conjunction with Cypress. After installation, add `\"test\": \"start-server-and-test start http://localhost:3000 cypress\"` to your `package.json` scripts field. Remember to rebuild your application after new changes.\n\n## [Creating your first Cypress component test](#creating-your-first-cypress-component-test)\n\nComponent tests build and mount a specific component without having to bundle your whole application or start a server.\n\nSelect **Component Testing** in the Cypress app, then select **Next.js** as your front-end framework. A `cypress/component` folder will be created in your project, and a `cypress.config.js` file will be updated to enable component testing.\n\nEnsure your `cypress.config.js` file has the following configuration:\n\n```\nimport { defineConfig } from 'cypress'\n \nexport default defineConfig({\n  component: {\n    devServer: {\n      framework: 'next',\n      bundler: 'webpack',\n    },\n  },\n})\n```\n\n```\nconst { defineConfig } = require('cypress')\n \nmodule.exports = defineConfig({\n  component: {\n    devServer: {\n      framework: 'next',\n      bundler: 'webpack',\n    },\n  },\n})\n```\n\nAssuming the same components from the previous section, add a test to validate a component is rendering the expected output:\n\n```\nimport AboutPage from '../../pages/about'\n \ndescribe('<AboutPage />', () => {\n  it('should render and display expected content', () => {\n    // Mount the React component for the About page\n    cy.mount(<AboutPage />)\n \n    // The new page should contain an h1 with \"About page\"\n    cy.get('h1').contains('About')\n \n    // Validate that a link with the expected URL is present\n    // *Following* the link is better suited to an E2E test\n    cy.get('a[href=\"/\"]').should('be.visible')\n  })\n})\n```\n\n> **Good to know**:\n> \n> *   Cypress currently doesn't support component testing for `async` Server Components. We recommend using E2E testing.\n> *   Since component tests do not require a Next.js server, features like `<Image />` that rely on a server being available may not function out-of-the-box.\n\n### [Running Component Tests](#running-component-tests)\n\nRun `npm run cypress:open` in your terminal to start Cypress and run your component testing suite.\n\n## [Continuous Integration (CI)](#continuous-integration-ci)\n\nIn addition to interactive testing, you can also run Cypress headlessly using the `cypress run` command, which is better suited for CI environments:\n\n```\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    //...\n    \"e2e\": \"start-server-and-test dev http://localhost:3000 \\\"cypress open --e2e\\\"\",\n    \"e2e:headless\": \"start-server-and-test dev http://localhost:3000 \\\"cypress run --e2e\\\"\",\n    \"component\": \"cypress open --component\",\n    \"component:headless\": \"cypress run --component\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nYou can learn more about Cypress and Continuous Integration from these resources:\n\n*   [Next.js with Cypress example](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-cypress)\n*   [Cypress Continuous Integration Docs](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/continuous-integration/introduction)\n*   [Cypress GitHub Actions Guide](https://on.cypress.io/github-actions)\n*   [Official Cypress GitHub Action](https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action)\n*   [Cypress Discord](https://discord.com/invite/cypress)",

    "markdown": "# Optimizing: Third Party Libraries | Next.js\n\n**`@next/third-parties`** is a library that provides a collection of components and utilities that improve the performance and developer experience of loading popular third-party libraries in your Next.js application.\n\nAll third-party integrations provided by `@next/third-parties` have been optimized for performance and ease of use.\n\n## [Getting Started](#getting-started)\n\nTo get started, install the `@next/third-parties` library:\n\n```\nnpm install @next/third-parties@latest next@latest\n```\n\n`@next/third-parties` is currently an **experimental** library under active development. We recommend installing it with the **latest** or **canary** flags while we work on adding more third-party integrations.\n\n## [Google Third-Parties](#google-third-parties)\n\nAll supported third-party libraries from Google can be imported from `@next/third-parties/google`.\n\n### [Google Tag Manager](#google-tag-manager)\n\nThe `GoogleTagManager` component can be used to instantiate a [Google Tag Manager](https://developers.google.com/tag-platform/tag-manager) container to your page. By default, it fetches the original inline script after hydration occurs on the page.\n\nTo load Google Tag Manager for all routes, include the component directly in your custom `_app` and pass in your GTM container ID:\n\n```\nimport { GoogleTagManager } from '@next/third-parties/google'\n \nexport default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Component {...pageProps} />\n      <GoogleTagManager gtmId=\"GTM-XYZ\" />\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nTo load Google Tag Manager for a single route, include the component in your page file:\n\n```\nimport { GoogleTagManager } from '@next/third-parties/google'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return <GoogleTagManager gtmId=\"GTM-XYZ\" />\n}\n```\n\n#### [Sending Events](#sending-events)\n\nThe `sendGTMEvent` function can be used to track user interactions on your page by sending events using the `dataLayer` object. For this function to work, the `<GoogleTagManager />` component must be included in either a parent layout, page, or component, or directly in the same file.\n\n```\nimport { sendGTMEvent } from '@next/third-parties/google'\n \nexport function EventButton() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <button\n        onClick={() => sendGTMEvent({ event: 'buttonClicked', value: 'xyz' })}\n      >\n        Send Event\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nRefer to the Tag Manager [developer documentation](https://developers.google.com/tag-platform/tag-manager/datalayer) to learn about the different variables and events that can be passed into the function.\n\n#### [Options](#options)\n\nOptions to pass to the Google Tag Manager. For a full list of options, read the [Google Tag Manager docs](https://developers.google.com/tag-platform/tag-manager/datalayer).\n\n| Name | Type | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `gtmId` | Required | Your GTM container ID. Usually starts with `GTM-`. |\n| `dataLayer` | Optional | Data layer array to instantiate the container with. Defaults to an empty array. |\n| `dataLayerName` | Optional | Name of the data layer. Defaults to `dataLayer`. |\n| `auth` | Optional | Value of authentication parameter (`gtm_auth`) for environment snippets. |\n| `preview` | Optional | Value of preview parameter (`gtm_preview`) for environment snippets. |\n\n### [Google Analytics](#google-analytics)\n\nThe `GoogleAnalytics` component can be used to include [Google Analytics 4](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/ga4) to your page via the Google tag (`gtag.js`). By default, it fetches the original scripts after hydration occurs on the page.\n\n> **Recommendation**: If Google Tag Manager is already included in your application, you can configure Google Analytics directly using it, rather than including Google Analytics as a separate component. Refer to the [documentation](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/ga4/tag-options#what-is-gtm) to learn more about the differences between Tag Manager and `gtag.js`.\n\nTo load Google Analytics for all routes, include the component directly in your custom `_app` and pass in your measurement ID:\n\n```\nimport { GoogleAnalytics } from '@next/third-parties/google'\n \nexport default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Component {...pageProps} />\n      <GoogleAnalytics gaId=\"G-XYZ\" />\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nTo load Google Analytics for a single route, include the component in your page file:\n\n```\nimport { GoogleAnalytics } from '@next/third-parties/google'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return <GoogleAnalytics gaId=\"G-XYZ\" />\n}\n```\n\n#### [Sending Events](#sending-events-1)\n\nThe `sendGAEvent` function can be used to measure user interactions on your page by sending events using the `dataLayer` object. For this function to work, the `<GoogleAnalytics />` component must be included in either a parent layout, page, or component, or directly in the same file.\n\n```\nimport { sendGAEvent } from '@next/third-parties/google'\n \nexport function EventButton() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <button\n        onClick={() => sendGAEvent({ event: 'buttonClicked', value: 'xyz' })}\n      >\n        Send Event\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nRefer to the Google Analytics [developer documentation](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/ga4/event-parameters) to learn more about event parameters.\n\n#### [Tracking Pageviews](#tracking-pageviews)\n\nGoogle Analytics automatically tracks pageviews when the browser history state changes. This means that client-side navigations between Next.js routes will send pageview data without any configuration.\n\nTo ensure that client-side navigations are being measured correctly, verify that the [_“Enhanced Measurement”_](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9216061#enable_disable) property is enabled in your Admin panel and the _“Page changes based on browser history events”_ checkbox is selected.\n\n> **Note**: If you decide to manually send pageview events, make sure to disable the default pageview measurement to avoid having duplicate data. Refer to the Google Analytics [developer documentation](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/ga4/views?client_type=gtag#manual_pageviews) to learn more.\n\n#### [Options](#options-1)\n\nOptions to pass to the `<GoogleAnalytics>` component.\n\n| Name | Type | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `gaId` | Required | Your [measurement ID](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/12270356). Usually starts with `G-`. |\n| `dataLayerName` | Optional | Name of the data layer.

    "markdown": "# Building Your Application: Authentication | Next.js\n\nTo implement authentication in Next.js, familiarize yourself with three foundational concepts:\n\n*   **[Authentication](#authentication)** verifies if the user is who they say they are. It requires the user to prove their identity with something they have, such as a username and password.\n*   **[Session Management](#session-management)** tracks the user's state (e.g. logged in) across multiple requests.\n*   **[Authorization](#authorization)** decides what parts of the application the user is allowed to access.\n\nThis page demonstrates how to use Next.js features to implement common authentication, authorization, and session management patterns so you can choose the best solutions based on your application's needs.\n\n## [Authentication](#authentication)\n\nAuthentication verifies a user's identity. This happens when a user logs in, either with a username and password or through a service like Google. It's all about confirming that users are really who they claim to be, protecting both the user's data and the application from unauthorized access or fraudulent activities.\n\n### [Authentication Strategies](#authentication-strategies)\n\nModern web applications commonly use several authentication strategies:\n\n1.  **OAuth/OpenID Connect (OIDC)**: Enable third-party access without sharing user credentials. Ideal for social media logins and Single Sign-On (SSO) solutions. They add an identity layer with OpenID Connect.\n2.  **Credentials-based login (Email + Password)**: A standard choice for web applications, where users log in with an email and password. Familiar and easy to implement, it requires robust security measures against threats like phishing.\n3.  **Passwordless/Token-based authentication**: Use email magic links or SMS one-time codes for secure, password-free access. Popular for its convenience and enhanced security, this method helps reduce password fatigue. Its limitation is the dependency on the user's email or phone availability.\n4.  **Passkeys/WebAuthn**: Use cryptographic credentials unique to each site, offering high security against phishing. Secure but new, this strategy can be difficult to implement.\n\nSelecting an authentication strategy should align with your application's specific requirements, user interface considerations, and security objectives.\n\n### [Implementing Authentication](#implementing-authentication)\n\nIn this section, we'll explore the process of adding basic email-password authentication to a web application. While this method provides a fundamental level of security, it's worth considering more advanced options like OAuth or passwordless logins for enhanced protection against common security threats. The authentication flow we'll discuss is as follows:\n\n1.  The user submits their credentials through a login form.\n2.  The form sends a request that is handled by an API route.\n3.  Upon successful verification, the process is completed, indicating the user's successful authentication.\n4.  If verification is unsuccessful, an error message is shown.\n\nConsider a login form where users can input their credentials:\n\n```\nimport { FormEvent } from 'react'\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/router'\n \nexport default function LoginPage() {\n  const router = useRouter()\n \n  async function handleSubmit(event: FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) {\n    event.preventDefault()\n \n    const formData = new FormData(event.currentTarget)\n    const email = formData.get('email')\n    const password = formData.get('password')\n \n    const response = await fetch('/api/auth/login', {\n      method: 'POST',\n      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },\n      body: JSON.stringify({ email, password }),\n    })\n \n    if (response.ok) {\n      router.push('/profile')\n    } else {\n      // Handle errors\n    }\n  }\n \n  return (\n    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>\n      <input type=\"email\" name=\"email\" placeholder=\"Email\" required />\n      <input type=\"password\" name=\"password\" placeholder=\"Password\" required />\n      <button type=\"submit\">Login</button>\n    </form>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nThe form above has two input fields for capturing the user's email and password. On submission, it triggers a function that sends a POST request to an API route (`/api/auth/login`).\n\nYou can then call your Authentication Provider's API in the API route to handle authentication:\n\n```\nimport { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next'\nimport { signIn } from '@/auth'\n \nexport default async function handler(\n  req: NextApiRequest,\n  res: NextApiResponse\n) {\n  try {\n    const { email, password } = req.body\n    await signIn('credentials', { email, password })\n \n    res.status(200).json({ success: true })\n  } catch (error) {\n    if (error.type === 'CredentialsSignin') {\n      res.status(401).json({ error: 'Invalid credentials.' })\n    } else {\n      res.status(500).json({ error: 'Something went wrong.' })\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, the `signIn` method checks the credentials against stored user data. After the authentication provider processes the credentials, there are two possible outcomes:\n\n*   **Successful Authentication**: This outcome implies that the login was successful. Further actions, such as accessing protected routes and fetching user information, can then be initiated.\n*   **Failed Authentication**: In cases where the credentials are incorrect or an error is encountered, the function returns a corresponding error message to indicate the authentication failure.\n\nFor a more streamlined authentication setup in Next.js projects, especially when offering multiple login methods, consider using a comprehensive [authentication solution](#examples).\n\nOnce a user is authenticated, you'll need to ensure the user is allowed to visit certain routes, and perform operations such as mutating data with Server Actions and calling Route Handlers.\n\n### [Protecting Routes with Middleware](#protecting-routes-with-middleware)\n\n[Middleware](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware) in Next.js helps you control who can access different parts of your website. This is important for keeping areas like the user dashboard protected while having other pages like marketing pages be public. It's recommended to apply Middleware across all routes and specify exclusions for public access.\n\nHere's how to implement Middleware for authentication in Next.js:\n\n#### [Setting Up Middleware:](#setting-up-middleware)\n\n*   Create a `middleware.ts` or `.js` file in your project's root directory.\n*   Include logic to authorize user access, such as checking for authentication tokens.\n\n#### [Defining Protected Routes:](#defining-protected-routes)\n\n*   Not all routes require authorization. Use the `matcher` option in your Middleware to specify any routes that do not require authorization checks.\n\n#### [Middleware Logic:](#middleware-logic)\n\n*   Write logic to verify if a user is authenticated. Check user roles or permissions for route authorization.\n\n#### [Handling Unauthorized Access:](#handling-unauthorized-access)\n\n*   Redirect unauthorized users to a login or error page as appropriate.\n\nExample Middleware file:\n\n```\nimport type { NextRequest } from 'next/server'\n \nexport function middleware(request: NextRequest) {\n  const currentUser = request.cookies.get('currentUser')?.value\n \n  if (currentUser && !request.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith('/dashboard')) {\n    return Response.redirect(new URL('/dashboard', request.url))\n  }\n \n  if (!currentUser && !request.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith('/login')) {\n    return Response.redirect(new URL('/login', request.url))\n  }\n}\n \nexport const config = {\n  matcher: ['/((?!api|_next/static|_next/image|.*\\\\.png$).*)'],\n}\n```\n\nThis example uses [`Response.redirect`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response/redirect_static) for handling redirects early in the request pipeline, making it efficient and centralizing access control.\n\nAfter successful authentication, it's important to manage user navigation based on their roles. For example, an admin user might be redirected to an admin dashboard, while a regular user is sent to a different page. This is important for role-specific experiences and conditional navigation, such as prompting users to complete their profile if needed.\n\nWhen setting up authorization, it's important to ensure that the main security checks happen where your app accesses or changes data. While Middleware can be useful for initial validation, it should not be the sole line of defense in protecting your data. The bulk of security checks should be performed in the Data Access Layer (DAL).\n\n### [Protecting API Routes](#protecting-api-routes)\n\nAPI Routes in Next.js are essential for handling server-side logic and data management. It's crucial to secure these routes to ensure that only authorized users can access specific functionalities. This typically involves verifying the user's authentication status and their role-based permissions.\n\nHere's an example of securing an API Route:\n\n```\nimport { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next'\n \nexport default async function handler(\n  req: NextApiRequest,\n  res: NextApiResponse\n) {\n  const session = await getSession(req)\n \n  // Check if the user is authenticated\n  if (!session) {\n    res.status(401).json({\n      error: 'User is not authenticated',\n    })\n    return\n  }\n \n  // Check if the user has the 'admin' role\n  if (session.user.role !== 'admin') {\n    res.status(401).json({\n      error: 'Unauthorized access: User does not have admin privileges.',\n    })\n    return\n  }\n \n  // Proceed with the route for authorized users\n  // ... implementation of the API Route\n}\n```\n\nThis example demonstrates an API Route with a two-tier security check for authentication and authorization. It first checks for an active session, and then verifies if the logged-in user is an 'admin'. This approach ensures secure access, limited to authenticated and authorized users, maintaining robust security for request processing.\n\n### [Best Practices](#best-practices)\n\n*   **Secure Session Management**: Prioritize the security of session data to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches. Use encryption and secure storage practices.\n*   **Dynamic Role Management**: Use a flexible system for user roles to easily adjust to changes in permissions and roles, avoiding hardcoded roles.\n*   **Security-First Approach**: In all aspects of authorization logic, prioritize security to safeguard user data and maintain the integrity of your application. This includes thorough testing and considering potential security vulnerabilities.\n\n## [Session Management](#session-management)\n\nSession management involves tracking and managing a user's interaction with the application over time, ensuring that their authenticated state is preserved across different parts of the application.\n\nThis prevents the need for repeated logins, enhancing both security and user convenience. There are two primary methods used for session management: cookie-based and database sessions.\n\n### [Cookie-Based Sessions](#cookie-based-sessions)\n\n> **🎥 Watch:** Learn more about cookie-based sessions and authentication with Next.js → [YouTube (11 minutes)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJvM2lSPn6w).\n\nCookie-based sessions manage user data by storing encrypted session information directly in browser cookies. Upon user login, this encrypted data is stored in the cookie. Each subsequent server request includes this cookie, minimizing the need for repeated server queries and enhancing client-side efficiency.\n\nHowever, this method requires careful encryption to protect sensitive data, as cookies are susceptible to client-side security risks. Encrypting session data in cookies is key to safeguarding user information from unauthorized access. It ensures that even if a cookie is stolen, the data inside remains unreadable.\n\nAdditionally, while individual cookies are limited in size (typically around 4KB), techniques like cookie-chunking can overcome this limitation by dividing large session data into multiple cookies.\n\nSetting a cookie in a Next.js project might look something like this:\n\n**Setting a cookie on the server:**\n\n```\nimport { serialize } from 'cookie'\nimport type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next'\n \nexport default function handler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {\n  const sessionData = req.body\n  const encryptedSessionData = encrypt(sessionData)\n \n  const cookie = serialize('session', encryptedSessionData, {\n    httpOnly: true,\n    secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production',\n    maxAge: 60 * 60 * 24 * 7, // One week\n    path: '/',\n  })\n  res.setHeader('Set-Cookie', cookie)\n  res.status(200).json({ message: 'Successfully set cookie!' })\n}\n```\n\n### [Database Sessions](#database-sessions)\n\nDatabase session management involves storing session data on the server, with the user's browser only receiving a session ID. This ID references the session data stored server-side, without containing the data itself. This method enhances security, as it keeps sensitive session data away from the client-side environment, reducing the risk of exposure to client-side attacks. Database sessions are also more scalable, accommodating larger data storage needs.\n\nHowever, this approach has its tradeoffs. It can increase performance overhead due to the need for database lookups at each user interaction. Strategies like session data caching can help mitigate this. Additionally, reliance on the database means that session management is as reliable as the database's performance and availability.\n\nHere's a simplified example of implementing database sessions in a Next.js application:\n\n**Creating a Session on the Server**:\n\n```\nimport db from '../../lib/db'\nimport { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next'\n \nexport default async function handler(\n  req: NextApiRequest,\n  res: NextApiResponse\n) {\n  try {\n    const user = req.body\n    const sessionId = generateSessionId()\n    await db.insertSession({\n      sessionId,\n      userId: user.id,\n      createdAt: new Date(),\n    })\n \n    res.status(200).json({ sessionId })\n  } catch (error) {\n    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Internal Server Error' })\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### [Selecting Session Management in Next.js](#selecting-session-management-in-nextjs)\n\nDeciding between cookie-based and database sessions in Next.js depends on your application's needs. Cookie-based sessions are simpler and suit smaller applications with lower server load but may offer less security. Database sessions, while more complex, provide better security and scalability, ideal for larger, data-sensitive applications.\n\nWith [authentication solutions](#examples) such as [NextAuth.js](https://authjs.dev/guides/upgrade-to-v5), session management becomes more efficient, using either cookies or database storage. This automation simplifies the development process, but it's important to understand the session management method used by your chosen solution. Ensure it aligns with your application's security and performance requirements.\n\nRegardless of your choice, prioritize security in your session management strategy. For cookie-based sessions, using secure and HTTP-only cookies is crucial to protect session data. For database sessions, regular backups and secure handling of session data are essential. Implementing session expiry and cleanup mechanisms is vital in both approaches to prevent unauthorized access and maintain application performance and reliability.\n\n## [Examples](#examples)\n\nHere are authentication solutions compatible with Next.js, please refer to the quickstart guides below to learn how to configure them in your Next.js application:\n\n*   [Auth0](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/webapp/nextjs/01-login)\n*   [Clerk](https://clerk.com/docs/quickstarts/nextjs)\n*   [Kinde](https://kinde.com/docs/developer-tools/nextjs-sdk)\n*   [Lucia](https://lucia-auth.com/getting-started/nextjs-app)\n*   [NextAuth.js](https://authjs.dev/guides/upgrade-to-v5)\n*   [Supabase](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/quickstarts/nextjs)\n*   [Stytch](https://stytch.com/docs/guides/quickstarts/nextjs)\n*   [Iron Session](https://github.com/vvo/iron-session)\n\n## [Further Reading](#further-reading)\n\nTo continue learning about authentication and security, check out the following resources:\n\n*   [Understanding XSS Attacks](https://vercel.com/guides/understanding-xss-attacks)\n*   [Understanding CSRF Attacks](https://vercel.com/guides/understanding-csrf-attacks)",

    "markdown": "# Components: <Head> | Next.js\n\nExamples\n\n*   [Head Elements](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/head-elements)\n*   [Layout Component](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/layout-component)\n\nWe expose a built-in component for appending elements to the `head` of the page:\n\n```\nimport Head from 'next/head'\n \nfunction IndexPage() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <Head>\n        <title>My page title</title>\n      </Head>\n      <p>Hello world!</p>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n \nexport default IndexPage\n```\n\nTo avoid duplicate tags in your `head` you can use the `key` property, which will make sure the tag is only rendered once, as in the following example:\n\n```\nimport Head from 'next/head'\n \nfunction IndexPage() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <Head>\n        <title>My page title</title>\n        <meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"My page title\" key=\"title\" />\n      </Head>\n      <Head>\n        <meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"My new title\" key=\"title\" />\n      </Head>\n      <p>Hello world!</p>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n \nexport default IndexPage\n```\n\nIn this case only the second `<meta property=\"og:title\" />` is rendered. `meta` tags with duplicate `key` attributes are automatically handled.\n\n> The contents of `head` get cleared upon unmounting the component, so make sure each page completely defines what it needs in `head`, without making assumptions about what other pages added.\n\n## [Use minimal nesting](#use-minimal-nesting)\n\n`title`, `meta` or any other elements (e.g. `script`) need to be contained as **direct** children of the `Head` element, or wrapped into maximum one level of `<React.Fragment>` or arrays—otherwise the tags won't be correctly picked up on client-side navigations.\n\n## [Use `next/script` for scripts](#use-nextscript-for-scripts)\n\nWe recommend using [`next/script`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/scripts) in your component instead of manually creating a `<script>` in `next/head`.\n\n## [No `html` or `body` tags](#no-html-or-body-tags)\n\nYou **cannot** use `<Head>` to set attributes on `<html>` or `<body>` tags. This will result in an `next-head-count is missing` error. `next/head` can only handle tags inside the HTML `<head>` tag.",

    "markdown": "# Optimizing: OpenTelemetry | Next.js\n\n> **Good to know**: This feature is **experimental**, you need to explicitly opt-in by providing `experimental.instrumentationHook = true;` in your `next.config.js`.\n\nObservability is crucial for understanding and optimizing the behavior and performance of your Next.js app.\n\nAs applications become more complex, it becomes increasingly difficult to identify and diagnose issues that may arise. By leveraging observability tools, such as logging and metrics, developers can gain insights into their application's behavior and identify areas for optimization. With observability, developers can proactively address issues before they become major problems and provide a better user experience. Therefore, it is highly recommended to use observability in your Next.js applications to improve performance, optimize resources, and enhance user experience.\n\nWe recommend using OpenTelemetry for instrumenting your apps. It's a platform-agnostic way to instrument apps that allows you to change your observability provider without changing your code. Read [Official OpenTelemetry docs](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/) for more information about OpenTelemetry and how it works.\n\nThis documentation uses terms like _Span_, _Trace_ or _Exporter_ throughout this doc, all of which can be found in [the OpenTelemetry Observability Primer](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/observability-primer/).\n\nNext.js supports OpenTelemetry instrumentation out of the box, which means that we already instrumented Next.js itself. When you enable OpenTelemetry we will automatically wrap all your code like `getStaticProps` in _spans_ with helpful attributes.\n\n## [Getting Started](#getting-started)\n\nOpenTelemetry is extensible but setting it up properly can be quite verbose. That's why we prepared a package `@vercel/otel` that helps you get started quickly.\n\n### [Using `@vercel/otel`](#using-vercelotel)\n\nTo get started, you must install `@vercel/otel`:\n\nNext, create a custom [`instrumentation.ts`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/instrumentation) (or `.js`) file in the **root directory** of the project (or inside `src` folder if using one):\n\n```\nimport { registerOTel } from '@vercel/otel'\n \nexport function register() {\n  registerOTel({ serviceName: 'next-app' })\n}\n```\n\nSee the [`@vercel/otel` documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vercel/otel) for additional configuration options.\n\n> **Good to know**\n> \n> *   The `instrumentation` file should be in the root of your project and not inside the `app` or `pages` directory. If you're using the `src` folder, then place the file inside `src` alongside `pages` and `app`.\n> *   If you use the [`pageExtensions` config option](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/next-config-js/pageExtensions) to add a suffix, you will also need to update the `instrumentation` filename to match.\n> *   We have created a basic [with-opentelemetry](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-opentelemetry) example that you can use.\n\n### [Manual OpenTelemetry configuration](#manual-opentelemetry-configuration)\n\nThe `@vercel/otel` package provides many configuration options and should serve most of common use cases. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can configure OpenTelemetry manually.\n\nFirstly you need to install OpenTelemetry packages:\n\n```\nnpm install @opentelemetry/sdk-node @opentelemetry/resources @opentelemetry/semantic-conventions @opentelemetry/sdk-trace-node @opentelemetry/exporter-trace-otlp-http\n```\n\nNow you can initialize `NodeSDK` in your `instrumentation.ts`. Unlike `@vercel/otel`, `NodeSDK` is not compatible with edge runtime, so you need to make sure that you are importing them only when `process.env.NEXT_RUNTIME === 'nodejs'`. We recommend creating a new file `instrumentation.node.ts` which you conditionally import only when using node:\n\n```\nexport async function register() {\n  if (process.env.NEXT_RUNTIME === 'nodejs') {\n    await import('./instrumentation.node.ts')\n  }\n}\n```\n\n```\nimport { NodeSDK } from '@opentelemetry/sdk-node'\nimport { OTLPTraceExporter } from '@opentelemetry/exporter-trace-otlp-http'\nimport { Resource } from '@opentelemetry/resources'\nimport { SEMRESATTRS_SERVICE_NAME } from '@opentelemetry/semantic-conventions'\nimport { SimpleSpanProcessor } from '@opentelemetry/sdk-trace-node'\n \nconst sdk = new NodeSDK({\n  resource: new Resource({\n    [SEMRESATTRS_SERVICE_NAME]: 'next-app',\n  }),\n  spanProcessor: new SimpleSpanProcessor(new OTLPTraceExporter()),\n})\nsdk.start()\n```\n\nDoing this is equivalent to using `@vercel/otel`, but it's possible to modify and extend some features that are not exposed by the `@vercel/otel`. If edge runtime support is necessary, you will have to use `@vercel/otel`.\n\n## [Testing your instrumentation](#testing-your-instrumentation)\n\nYou need an OpenTelemetry collector with a compatible backend to test OpenTelemetry traces locally. We recommend using our [OpenTelemetry dev environment](https://github.com/vercel/opentelemetry-collector-dev-setup).\n\nIf everything works well you should be able to see the root server span labeled as `GET /requested/pathname`. All other spans from that particular trace will be nested under it.\n\nNext.js traces more spans than are emitted by default. To see more spans, you must set `NEXT_OTEL_VERBOSE=1`.\n\n## [Deployment](#deployment)\n\n### [Using OpenTelemetry Collector](#using-opentelemetry-collector)\n\nWhen you are deploying with OpenTelemetry Collector, you can use `@vercel/otel`. It will work both on Vercel and when self-hosted.\n\n#### [Deploying on Vercel](#deploying-on-vercel)\n\nWe made sure that OpenTelemetry works out of the box on Vercel.\n\nFollow [Vercel documentation](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/observability/otel-overview/quickstart) to connect your project to an observability provider.\n\n#### [Self-hosting](#self-hosting)\n\nDeploying to other platforms is also straightforward. You will need to spin up your own OpenTelemetry Collector to receive and process the telemetry data from your Next.js app.\n\nTo do this, follow the [OpenTelemetry Collector Getting Started guide](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/getting-started/), which will walk you through setting up the collector and configuring it to receive data from your Next.js app.\n\nOnce you have your collector up and running, you can deploy your Next.js app to your chosen platform following their respective deployment guides.\n\n### [Custom Exporters](#custom-exporters)\n\nOpenTelemetry Collector is not necessary. You can use a custom OpenTelemetry exporter with [`@vercel/otel`](#using-vercelotel) or [manual OpenTelemetry configuration](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/open-telemetry#manual-opentelemetry-configuration).\n\n## [Custom Spans](#custom-spans)\n\nYou can add a custom span with [OpenTelemetry APIs](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/instrumentation/js/instrumentation).\n\n```\nnpm install @opentelemetry/api\n```\n\nThe following example demonstrates a function that fetches GitHub stars and adds a custom `fetchGithubStars` span to track the fetch request's result:\n\n```\nimport { trace } from '@opentelemetry/api'\n \nexport async function fetchGithubStars() {\n  return await trace\n    .getTracer('nextjs-example')\n    .startActiveSpan('fetchGithubStars', async (span) => {\n      try {\n        return await getValue()\n      } finally {\n        span.end()\n      }\n    })\n}\n```\n\nThe `register` function will execute before your code runs in a new environment. You can start creating new spans, and they should be correctly added to the exported trace.\n\n## [Default Spans in Next.js](#default-spans-in-nextjs)\n\nNext.js automatically instruments several spans for you to provide useful insights into your application's performance.\n\nAttributes on spans follow [OpenTelemetry semantic conventions](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/reference/specification/trace/semantic_conventions/). We also add some custom attributes under the `next` namespace:\n\n*   `next.span_name` - duplicates span name\n*   `next.span_type` - each span type has a unique identifier\n*   `next.route` - The route pattern of the request (e.g., `/[param]/user`).\n*   `next.rsc` (true/false) - Whether the request is an RSC request, such as prefetch.\n*   `next.page`\n    *   This is an internal value used by an app router.\n    *   You can think about it as a route to a special file (like `page.ts`, `layout.ts`, `loading.ts` and others)\n    *   It can be used as a unique identifier only when paired with `next.route` because `/layout` can be used to identify both `/(groupA)/layout.ts` and `/(groupB)/layout.ts`\n\n### [`[http.method] [next.route]`](#httpmethod-nextroute)\n\n*   `next.span_type`: `BaseServer.handleRequest`\n\nThis span represents the root span for each incoming request to your Next.js application. It tracks the HTTP method, route, target, and status code of the request.\n\nAttributes:\n\n*   [Common HTTP attributes](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/reference/specification/trace/semantic_conventions/http/#common-attributes)\n    *   `http.method`\n    *   `http.status_code`\n*   [Server HTTP attributes](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/reference/specification/trace/semantic_conventions/http/#http-server-semantic-conventions)\n    *   `http.route`\n    *   `http.target`\n*   `next.span_name`\n*   `next.span_type`\n*   `next.route`\n\n### [`render route (app) [next.route]`](#render-route-app-nextroute)\n\n*   `next.span_type`: `AppRender.getBodyResult`.\n\nThis span represents the process of rendering a route in the app router.\n\nAttributes:\n\n*   `next.span_name`\n*   `next.span_type`\n*   `next.route`\n\n### [`fetch [http.method] [http.url]`](#fetch-httpmethod-httpurl)\n\n*   `next.span_type`: `AppRender.fetch`\n\nThis span represents the fetch request executed in your code.\n\nAttributes:\n\n*   [Common HTTP attributes](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/reference/specification/trace/semantic_conventions/http/#common-attributes)\n    *   `http.method`\n*   [Client HTTP attributes](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/reference/specification/trace/semantic_conventions/http/#http-client)\n    *   `http.url`\n    *   `net.peer.name`\n    *   `net.peer.port` (only if specified)\n*   `next.span_name`\n*   `next.span_type`\n\nThis span can be turned off by setting `NEXT_OTEL_FETCH_DISABLED=1` in your environment. This is useful when you want to use a custom fetch instrumentation library.\n\n### [`executing api route (app) [next.route]`](#executing-api-route-app-nextroute)\n\n*   `next.span_type`: `AppRouteRouteHandlers.runHandler`.\n\nThis span represents the execution of an API route handler in the app router.\n\nAttributes:\n\n*   `next.span_name`\n*   `next.span_type`\n*   `next.route`\n\n### [`getServerSideProps [next.route]`](#getserversideprops-nextroute)\n\n*   `next.span_type`: `Render.getServerSideProps`.\n\nThis span represents the execution of `getServerSideProps` for a specific route.\n\nAttributes:\n\n*   `next.span_name`\n*   `next.span_type`\n*   `next.route`\n\n### [`getStaticProps [next.route]`](#getstaticprops-nextroute)\n\n*   `next.span_type`: `Render.getStaticProps`.\n\nThis span represents the execution of `getStaticProps` for a specific route.\n\nAttributes:\n\n*   `next.span_name`\n*   `next.span_type`\n*   `next.route`\n\n### [`render route (pages) [next.route]`](#render-route-pages-nextroute)\n\n*   `next.span_type`: `Render.renderDocument`.\n\nThis span represents the process of rendering the document for a specific route.\n\nAttributes:\n\n*   `next.span_name`\n*   `next.span_type`\n*   `next.route`\n\n### [`generateMetadata [next.page]`](#generatemetadata-nextpage)\n\n*   `next.span_type`: `ResolveMetadata.generateMetadata`.\n\nThis span represents the process of generating metadata for a specific page (a single route can have multiple of these spans).\n\nAttributes:\n\n*   `next.span_name`\n*   `next.span_type`\n*   `next.page`\n\n### [`resolve page components`](#resolve-page-components)\n\n*   `next.span_type`: `NextNodeServer.findPageComponents`.\n\nThis span represents the process of resolving page components for a specific page.\n\nAttributes:\n\n*   `next.span_name`\n*   `next.span_type`\n*   `next.route`\n\n### [`resolve segment modules`](#resolve-segment-modules)\n\n*   `next.span_type`: `NextNodeServer.getLayoutOrPageModule`.\n\nThis span represents loading of code modules for a layout or a page.\n\nAttributes:\n\n*   `next.span_name`\n*   `next.span_type`\n*   `next.segment`\n\n### [`start response`](#start-response)\n\n*   `next.span_type`: `NextNodeServer.startResponse`.\n\nThis zero-length span represents the time when the first byte has been sent in the response.",

    "markdown": "# Building Your Application: Deploying | Next.js\n\nCongratulations, it's time to ship to production.\n\nYou can deploy [managed Next.js with Vercel](#managed-nextjs-with-vercel), or self-host on a Node.js server, Docker image, or even static HTML files. When deploying using `next start`, all Next.js features are supported.\n\n## [Production Builds](#production-builds)\n\nRunning `next build` generates an optimized version of your application for production. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files are created based on your pages. JavaScript is **compiled** and browser bundles are **minified** using the [Next.js Compiler](https://nextjs.org/docs/architecture/nextjs-compiler) to help achieve the best performance and support [all modern browsers](https://nextjs.org/docs/architecture/supported-browsers).\n\nNext.js produces a standard deployment output used by managed and self-hosted Next.js. This ensures all features are supported across both methods of deployment. In the next major version, we will be transforming this output into our [Build Output API specification](https://vercel.com/docs/build-output-api/v3?utm_source=next-site&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=next-website).\n\n## [Managed Next.js with Vercel](#managed-nextjs-with-vercel)\n\n[Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/frameworks/nextjs?utm_source=next-site&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=next-website), the creators and maintainers of Next.js, provide managed infrastructure and a developer experience platform for your Next.js applications.\n\nDeploying to Vercel is zero-configuration and provides additional enhancements for scalability, availability, and performance globally. However, all Next.js features are still supported when self-hosted.\n\nLearn more about [Next.js on Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/frameworks/nextjs?utm_source=next-site&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=next-website) or [deploy a template for free](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js?utm_source=next-site&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=next-website) to try it out.\n\n## [Self-Hosting](#self-hosting)\n\nYou can self-host Next.js in three different ways:\n\n*   [A Node.js server](#nodejs-server)\n*   [A Docker container](#docker-image)\n*   [A static export](#static-html-export)\n\n### [Node.js Server](#nodejs-server)\n\nNext.js can be deployed to any hosting provider that supports Node.js. Ensure your `package.json` has the `\"build\"` and `\"start\"` scripts:\n\n```\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"dev\": \"next dev\",\n    \"build\": \"next build\",\n    \"start\": \"next start\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThen, run `npm run build` to build your application. Finally, run `npm run start` to start the Node.js server. This server supports all Next.js features.\n\n### [Docker Image](#docker-image)\n\nNext.js can be deployed to any hosting provider that supports [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) containers. You can use this approach when deploying to container orchestrators such as [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) or when running inside a container in any cloud provider.\n\n1.  [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) on your machine\n2.  [Clone our example](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-docker) (or the [multi-environment example](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-docker-multi-env))\n3.  Build your container: `docker build -t nextjs-docker .`\n4.  Run your container: `docker run -p 3000:3000 nextjs-docker`\n\nNext.js through Docker supports all Next.js features.\n\n### [Static HTML Export](#static-html-export)\n\nNext.js enables starting as a static site or Single-Page Application (SPA), then later optionally upgrading to use features that require a server.\n\nSince Next.js supports this [static export](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying/static-exports), it can be deployed and hosted on any web server that can serve HTML/CSS/JS static assets. This includes tools like AWS S3, Nginx, or Apache.\n\nRunning as a [static export](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying/static-exports) does not support Next.js features that require a server. [Learn more](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying/static-exports#unsupported-features).\n\n> **Good to know:**\n> \n> *   [Server Components](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components) are supported with static exports.\n\n## [Features](#features)\n\n### [Image Optimization](#image-optimization)\n\n[Image Optimization](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/images) through `next/image` works self-hosted with zero configuration when deploying using `next start`. If you would prefer to have a separate service to optimize images, you can [configure an image loader](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/images#loaders).\n\nImage Optimization can be used with a [static export](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying/static-exports#image-optimization) by defining a custom image loader in `next.config.js`. Note that images are optimized at runtime, not during the build.\n\n> **Good to know:**\n> \n> *   When self-hosting, consider installing `sharp` for more performant [Image Optimization](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/images) in your production environment by running `npm install sharp` in your project directory. On Linux platforms, `sharp` may require [additional configuration](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/install#linux-memory-allocator) to prevent excessive memory usage.\n> *   Learn more about the [caching behavior of optimized images](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/components/image#caching-behavior) and how to configure the TTL.\n> *   You can also [disable Image Optimization](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/components/image#unoptimized) and still retain other benefits of using `next/image` if you prefer. For example, if you are optimizing images yourself separately.\n\n### [Middleware](#middleware)\n\n[Middleware](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware) works self-hosted with zero configuration when deploying using `next start`. Since it requires access to the incoming request, it is not supported when using a [static export](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying/static-exports).\n\nMiddleware uses a [runtime](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/edge-and-nodejs-runtimes) that is a subset of all available Node.js APIs to help ensure low latency, since it may run in front of every route or asset in your application. This runtime does not require running “at the edge” and works in a single-region server. Additional configuration and infrastructure are required to run Middleware in multiple regions.\n\nIf you are looking to add logic (or use an external package) that requires all Node.js APIs, you might be able to move this logic to a [layout](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts#layouts) as a [Server Component](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components). For example, checking [headers](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/headers) and [redirecting](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/redirect). You can also use headers, cookies, or query parameters to [redirect](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/redirects#header-cookie-and-query-matching) or [rewrite](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/rewrites#header-cookie-and-query-matching) through `next.config.js`. If that does not work, you can also use a [custom server](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/custom-server).\n\n### [Environment Variables](#environment-variables)\n\nNext.js can support both build time and runtime environment variables.\n\n**By default, environment variables are only available on the server**. To expose an environment variable to the browser, it must be prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`. However, these public environment variables will be inlined into the JavaScript bundle during `next build`.\n\nTo read runtime environment variables, we recommend using `getServerSideProps` or [incrementally adopting the App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/upgrading/app-router-migration). With the App Router, we can safely read environment variables on the server during dynamic rendering. This allows you to use a singular Docker image that can be promoted through multiple environments with different values.\n\n```\nimport { unstable_noStore as noStore } from 'next/cache';\n \nexport default function Component() {\n  noStore();\n  // cookies(), headers(), and other dynamic functions\n  // will also opt into dynamic rendering, making\n  // this env variable is evaluated at runtime\n  const value = process.env.MY_VALUE\n  ...\n}\n```\n\n> **Good to know:**\n> \n> *   You can run code on server startup using the [`register` function](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/instrumentation).\n> *   We do not recommend using the [runtimeConfig](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/next-config-js/runtime-configuration) option, as this does not work with the standalone output mode. Instead, we recommend [incrementally adopting](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/upgrading/app-router-migration) the App Router.\n\n### [Caching and ISR](#caching-and-isr)\n\nNext.js can cache responses, generated static pages, build outputs, and other static assets like images, fonts, and scripts.\n\nCaching and revalidating pages (using Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) or newer functions in the App Router) use the **same shared cache**. By default, this cache is stored to the filesystem (on disk) on your Next.js server. **This works automatically when self-hosting** using both the Pages and App Router.\n\nYou can configure the Next.js cache location if you want to persist cached pages and data to durable storage, or share the cache across multiple containers or instances of your Next.js application.\n\n#### [Automatic Caching](#automatic-caching)\n\n*   Next.js sets the `Cache-Control` header of `public, max-age=31536000, immutable` to truly immutable assets. It cannot be overridden. These immutable files contain a SHA-hash in the file name, so they can be safely cached indefinitely. For example, [Static Image Imports](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/images#local-images). You can [configure the TTL](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/components/image#caching-behavior) for images.\n*   Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) sets the `Cache-Control` header of `s-maxage: <revalidate in getStaticProps>, stale-while-revalidate`. This revalidation time is defined in your [`getStaticProps` function](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-static-props) in seconds. If you set `revalidate: false`, it will default to a one-year cache duration.\n*   Dynamically rendered pages set a `Cache-Control` header of `private, no-cache, no-store, max-age=0, must-revalidate` to prevent user-specific data from being cached. This applies to both the App Router and Pages Router. This also includes [Draft Mode](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/draft-mode).\n\n#### [Static Assets](#static-assets)\n\nIf you want to host static assets on a different domain or CDN, you can use the `assetPrefix` [configuration](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/assetPrefix) in `next.config.js`. Next.js will use this asset prefix when retrieving JavaScript or CSS files. Separating your assets to a different domain does come with the downside of extra time spent on DNS and TLS resolution.\n\n[Learn more about `assetPrefix`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/assetPrefix).\n\n#### [Configuring Caching](#configuring-caching)\n\nBy default, generated cache assets will be stored in memory (defaults to 50mb) and on disk. If you are hosting Next.js using a container orchestration platform like Kubernetes, each pod will have a copy of the cache. To prevent stale data from being shown since the cache is not shared between pods by default, you can configure the Next.js cache to provide a cache handler and disable in-memory caching.\n\nTo configure the ISR/Data Cache location when self-hosting, you can configure a custom handler in your `next.config.js` file:\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  cacheHandler: require.resolve('./cache-handler.js'),\n  cacheMaxMemorySize: 0, // disable default in-memory caching\n}\n```\n\nThen, create `cache-handler.js` in the root of your project, for example:\n\n```\nconst cache = new Map()\n \nmodule.exports = class CacheHandler {\n  constructor(options) {\n    this.options = options\n  }\n \n  async get(key) {\n    // This could be stored anywhere, like durable storage\n    return cache.get(key)\n  }\n \n  async set(key, data, ctx) {\n    // This could be stored anywhere, like durable storage\n    cache.set(key, {\n      value: data,\n      lastModified: Date.now(),\n      tags: ctx.tags,\n    })\n  }\n \n  async revalidateTag(tag) {\n    // Iterate over all entries in the cache\n    for (let [key, value] of cache) {\n      // If the value's tags include the specified tag, delete this entry\n      if (value.tags.includes(tag)) {\n        cache.delete(key)\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nUsing a custom cache handler will allow you to ensure consistency across all pods hosting your Next.js application. For instance, you can save the cached values anywhere, like [Redis](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/cache-handler-redis) or AWS S3.\n\n> **Good to know:**\n> \n> *   `revalidatePath` is a convenience layer on top of cache tags. Calling `revalidatePath` will call the `revalidateTag` function with a special default tag for the provided page.\n\n### [Build Cache](#build-cache)\n\nNext.js generates an ID during `next build` to identify which version of your application is being served. The same build should be used and boot up multiple containers.\n\nIf you are rebuilding for each stage of your environment, you will need to generate a consistent build ID to use between containers. Use the `generateBuildId` command in `next.config.js`:\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  generateBuildId: async () => {\n    // This could be anything, using the latest git hash\n    return process.env.GIT_HASH\n  },\n}\n```\n\n### [Version Skew](#version-skew)\n\nNext.js will automatically mitigate most instances of [version skew](https://www.industrialempathy.com/posts/version-skew/) and automatically reload the application to retrieve new assets when detected. For example, if there is a mismatch in the `deploymentId`, transitions between pages will perform a hard navigation versus using a prefetched value.\n\nWhen the application is reloaded, there may be a loss of application state if it's not designed to persist between page navigations. For example, using URL state or local storage would persist state after a page refresh. However, component state like `useState` would be lost in such navigations.\n\nVercel provides additional [skew protection](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/skew-protection?utm_source=next-site&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=next-website) for Next.js applications to ensure assets and functions from the previous version are still available to older clients, even after the new version is deployed.\n\nYou can manually configure the `deploymentId` property in your `next.config.js` file to ensure each request uses either `?dpl` query string or `x-deployment-id` header.\n\n## [Manual Graceful Shutdowns](#manual-graceful-shutdowns)\n\nWhen self-hosting, you might want to run code when the server shuts down on `SIGTERM` or `SIGINT` signals.\n\nYou can set the env variable `NEXT_MANUAL_SIG_HANDLE` to `true` and then register a handler for that signal inside your `_document.js` file. You will need to register the environment variable directly in the `package.json` script, and not in the `.env` file.\n\n> **Good to know**: Manual signal handling is not available in `next dev`.\n\n```\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"dev\": \"next dev\",\n    \"build\": \"next build\",\n    \"start\": \"NEXT_MANUAL_SIG_HANDLE=true next start\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n```\nif (process.env.NEXT_MANUAL_SIG_HANDLE) {\n  process.on('SIGTERM', () => {\n    console.log('Received SIGTERM: cleaning up')\n    process.exit(0)\n  })\n  process.on('SIGINT', () => {\n    console.log('Received SIGINT: cleaning up')\n    process.exit(0)\n  })\n}\n```",

    "markdown": "# Deploying: Production Checklist | Next.js\n\nBefore taking your Next.js application to production, there are some optimizations and patterns you should consider implementing for the best user experience, performance, and security.\n\nThis page provides best practices that you can use as a reference when [building your application](#during-development), [before going to production](#before-going-to-production), and [after deployment](#after-deployment) - as well as the [automatic Next.js optimizations](#automatic-optimizations) you should be aware of.\n\n## [Automatic optimizations](#automatic-optimizations)\n\nThese Next.js optimizations are enabled by default and require no configuration:\n\n*   **[Code-splitting](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts):** Next.js automatically code-splits your application code by pages. This means only the code needed for the current page is loaded on navigation. You may also consider [lazy loading](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/lazy-loading) third-party libraries, where appropriate.\n*   **[Prefetching](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/components/link#prefetch):** When a link to a new route enters the user's viewport, Next.js prefetches the route in background. This makes navigation to new routes almost instant. You can opt out of prefetching, where appropriate.\n*   **[Automatic Static Optimization](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/rendering/automatic-static-optimization):** Next.js automatically determines that a page is static (can be pre-rendered) if it has no blocking data requirements. Optimized pages can be cached, and served to the end-user from multiple CDN locations. You may opt into [Server-side Rendering](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-server-side-props), where appropriate.\n\nThese defaults aim to improve your application's performance, and reduce the cost and amount of data transferred on each network request.\n\n## [During development](#during-development)\n\nWhile building your application, we recommend using the following features to ensure the best performance and user experience:\n\n### [Routing and rendering](#routing-and-rendering)\n\n*   **[`<Link>` component](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/linking-and-navigating):** Use the `<Link>` component for client-side navigation and prefetching.\n*   **[Custom Errors](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/custom-error):** Gracefully handle [500](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/custom-error#500-page) and [404 errors](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/custom-error#404-page)\n\n### [Data fetching and caching](#data-fetching-and-caching)\n\n*   **[API Routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes):** Use Route Handlers to access your backend resources, and prevent sensitive secrets from being exposed to the client.\n*   **[Data Caching](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-static-props):** Verify whether your data requests are being cached or not, and opt into caching, where appropriate. Ensure requests that don't use `getStaticProps` are cached where appropriate.\n*   **[Incremental Static Regeneration](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/incremental-static-regeneration):** Use Incremental Static Regeneration to update static pages after they've been built, without rebuilding your entire site.\n*   **[Static Images](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/static-assets):** Use the `public` directory to automatically cache your application's static assets, e.g. images.\n\n### [UI and accessibility](#ui-and-accessibility)\n\n*   **[Font Module](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts):** Optimize fonts by using the Font Module, which automatically hosts your font files with other static assets, removes external network requests, and reduces [layout shift](https://web.dev/articles/cls).\n*   **[`<Image>` Component](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/images):** Optimize images by using the Image Component, which automatically optimizes images, prevents layout shift, and serves them in modern formats like WebP or AVIF.\n*   **[`<Script>` Component](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/scripts):** Optimize third-party scripts by using the Script Component, which automatically defers scripts and prevents them from blocking the main thread.\n*   **[ESLint](https://nextjs.org/docs/architecture/accessibility#linting):** Use the built-in `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y` plugin to catch accessibility issues early.\n\n### [Security](#security)\n\n*   **[Environment Variables](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/environment-variables):** Ensure your `.env.*` files are added to `.gitignore` and only public variables are prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`.\n*   **[Content Security Policy](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/content-security-policy):** Consider adding a Content Security Policy to protect your application against various security threats such as cross-site scripting, clickjacking, and other code injection attacks.\n\n### [Metadata and SEO](#metadata-and-seo)\n\n*   **[`<Head>` Component](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/components/head):** Use the `next/head` component to add page titles, descriptions, and more.\n\n### [Type safety](#type-safety)\n\n*   **TypeScript and [TS Plugin](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/typescript):** Use TypeScript and the TypeScript plugin for better type-safety, and to help you catch errors early.\n\n## [Before going to production](#before-going-to-production)\n\nBefore going to production, you can run `next build` to build your application locally and catch any build errors, then run `next start` to measure the performance of your application in a production-like environment.\n\n### [Core Web Vitals](#core-web-vitals)\n\n*   **[Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse):** Run lighthouse in incognito to gain a better understanding of how your users will experience your site, and to identify areas for improvement. This is a simulated test and should be paired with looking at field data (such as Core Web Vitals).\n\n### [Analyzing bundles](#analyzing-bundles)\n\nUse the [`@next/bundle-analyzer` plugin](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/bundle-analyzer) to analyze the size of your JavaScript bundles and identify large modules and dependencies that might be impacting your application's performance.\n\nAdditionally, the following tools can you understand the impact of adding new dependencies to your application:\n\n*   [Import Cost](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wix.vscode-import-cost)\n*   [Package Phobia](https://packagephobia.com/)\n*   [Bundle Phobia](https://bundlephobia.com/)\n*   [bundlejs](https://bundlejs.com/)\n\n## [After deployment](#after-deployment)\n\nDepending on where you deploy your application, you might have access to additional tools and integrations to help you monitor and improve your application's performance.\n\nFor Vercel deployments, we recommend the following:\n\n*   **[Analytics](https://vercel.com/analytics?utm_source=next-site&utm_campaign=nextjs-docs&utm_medium=docs):** A built-in analytics dashboard to help you understand your application's traffic, including the number of unique visitors, page views, and more.\n*   **[Speed Insights](https://vercel.com/docs/speed-insights?utm_source=next-site&utm_campaign=nextjs-docs&utm_medium=docs):** Real-world performance insights based on visitor data, offering a practical view of how your website is performing in the field.\n*   **[Logging](https://vercel.com/docs/observability/runtime-logs?utm_source=next-site&utm_campaign=nextjs-docs&utm_medium=docs):** Runtime and Activity logs to help you debug issues and monitor your application in production. Alternatively, see the [integrations page](https://vercel.com/integrations?utm_source=next-site&utm_campaign=nextjs-docs&utm_medium=docs) for a list of third-party tools and services.\n\n> **Good to know:**\n> \n> To get a comprehensive understanding of the best practices for production deployments on Vercel, including detailed strategies for improving website performance, refer to the [Vercel Production Checklist](https://vercel.com/docs/production-checklist?utm_source=next-site&utm_campaign=nextjs-docs&utm_medium=docs).\n\nFollowing these recommendations will help you build a faster, more reliable, and secure application for your users.",

    "markdown": "# Configuring: ESLint | Next.js\n\nNext.js provides an integrated [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) experience out of the box. Add `next lint` as a script to `package.json`:\n\n```\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"lint\": \"next lint\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThen run `npm run lint` or `yarn lint`:\n\nIf you don't already have ESLint configured in your application, you will be guided through the installation and configuration process.\n\n> You'll see a prompt like this:\n> \n> ? How would you like to configure ESLint?\n> \n> ❯ Strict (recommended)  \n> Base  \n> Cancel\n\nOne of the following three options can be selected:\n\n*   **Strict**: Includes Next.js' base ESLint configuration along with a stricter [Core Web Vitals rule-set](#core-web-vitals). This is the recommended configuration for developers setting up ESLint for the first time.\n    \n    ```\n    {\n      \"extends\": \"next/core-web-vitals\"\n    }\n    ```\n    \n*   **Base**: Includes Next.js' base ESLint configuration.\n    \n*   **Cancel**: Does not include any ESLint configuration. Only select this option if you plan on setting up your own custom ESLint configuration.\n    \n\nIf either of the two configuration options are selected, Next.js will automatically install `eslint` and `eslint-config-next` as dependencies in your application and create an `.eslintrc.json` file in the root of your project that includes your selected configuration.\n\nYou can now run `next lint` every time you want to run ESLint to catch errors. Once ESLint has been set up, it will also automatically run during every build (`next build`). Errors will fail the build, while warnings will not.\n\n> If you do not want ESLint to run during `next build`, refer to the documentation for [Ignoring ESLint](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/next-config-js/eslint).\n\nWe recommend using an appropriate [integration](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/integrations#editors) to view warnings and errors directly in your code editor during development.\n\n## [ESLint Config](#eslint-config)\n\nThe default configuration (`eslint-config-next`) includes everything you need to have an optimal out-of-the-box linting experience in Next.js. If you do not have ESLint already configured in your application, we recommend using `next lint` to set up ESLint along with this configuration.\n\n> If you would like to use `eslint-config-next` along with other ESLint configurations, refer to the [Additional Configurations](#additional-configurations) section to learn how to do so without causing any conflicts.\n\nRecommended rule-sets from the following ESLint plugins are all used within `eslint-config-next`:\n\n*   [`eslint-plugin-react`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-react)\n*   [`eslint-plugin-react-hooks`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-react-hooks)\n*   [`eslint-plugin-next`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@next/eslint-plugin-next)\n\nThis will take precedence over the configuration from `next.config.js`.\n\n## [ESLint Plugin](#eslint-plugin)\n\nNext.js provides an ESLint plugin, [`eslint-plugin-next`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@next/eslint-plugin-next), already bundled within the base configuration that makes it possible to catch common issues and problems in a Next.js application. The full set of rules is as follows:\n\nEnabled in the recommended configuration\n\nIf you already have ESLint configured in your application, we recommend extending from this plugin directly instead of including `eslint-config-next` unless a few conditions are met. Refer to the [Recommended Plugin Ruleset](#recommended-plugin-ruleset) to learn more.\n\n### [Custom Settings](#custom-settings)\n\n#### [`rootDir`](#rootdir)\n\nIf you're using `eslint-plugin-next` in a project where Next.js isn't installed in your root directory (such as a monorepo), you can tell `eslint-plugin-next` where to find your Next.js application using the `settings` property in your `.eslintrc`:\n\n```\n{\n  \"extends\": \"next\",\n  \"settings\": {\n    \"next\": {\n      \"rootDir\": \"packages/my-app/\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n`rootDir` can be a path (relative or absolute), a glob (i.e. `\"packages/*/\"`), or an array of paths and/or globs.\n\n## [Linting Custom Directories and Files](#linting-custom-directories-and-files)\n\nBy default, Next.js will run ESLint for all files in the `pages/`, `app/`, `components/`, `lib/`, and `src/` directories. However, you can specify which directories using the `dirs` option in the `eslint` config in `next.config.js` for production builds:\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  eslint: {\n    dirs: ['pages', 'utils'], // Only run ESLint on the 'pages' and 'utils' directories during production builds (next build)\n  },\n}\n```\n\nSimilarly, the `--dir` and `--file` flags can be used for `next lint` to lint specific directories and files:\n\n```\nnext lint --dir pages --dir utils --file bar.js\n```\n\n## [Caching](#caching)\n\nTo improve performance, information of files processed by ESLint are cached by default. This is stored in `.next/cache` or in your defined [build directory](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/next-config-js/distDir). If you include any ESLint rules that depend on more than the contents of a single source file and need to disable the cache, use the `--no-cache` flag with `next lint`.\n\n## [Disabling Rules](#disabling-rules)\n\nIf you would like to modify or disable any rules provided by the supported plugins (`react`, `react-hooks`, `next`), you can directly change them using the `rules` property in your `.eslintrc`:\n\n```\n{\n  \"extends\": \"next\",\n  \"rules\": {\n    \"react/no-unescaped-entities\": \"off\",\n    \"@next/next/no-page-custom-font\": \"off\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### [Core Web Vitals](#core-web-vitals)\n\nThe `next/core-web-vitals` rule set is enabled when `next lint` is run for the first time and the **strict** option is selected.\n\n```\n{\n  \"extends\": \"next/core-web-vitals\"\n}\n```\n\n`next/core-web-vitals` updates `eslint-plugin-next` to error on a number of rules that are warnings by default if they affect [Core Web Vitals](https://web.dev/vitals/).\n\n> The `next/core-web-vitals` entry point is automatically included for new applications built with [Create Next App](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/create-next-app).\n\n### [Prettier](#prettier)\n\nESLint also contains code formatting rules, which can conflict with your existing [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) setup. We recommend including [eslint-config-prettier](https://github.com/prettier/eslint-config-prettier) in your ESLint config to make ESLint and Prettier work together.\n\nFirst, install the dependency:\n\n```\nnpm install --save-dev eslint-config-prettier\n \nyarn add --dev eslint-config-prettier\n \npnpm add --save-dev eslint-config-prettier\n \nbun add --dev eslint-config-prettier\n```\n\nThen, add `prettier` to your existing ESLint config:\n\n```\n{\n  \"extends\": [\"next\", \"prettier\"]\n}\n```\n\n### [lint-staged](#lint-staged)\n\nIf you would like to use `next lint` with [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged) to run the linter on staged git files, you'll have to add the following to the `.lintstagedrc.js` file in the root of your project in order to specify usage of the `--file` flag.\n\n```\nconst path = require('path')\n \nconst buildEslintCommand = (filenames) =>\n  `next lint --fix --file ${filenames\n    .map((f) => path.relative(process.cwd(), f))\n    .join(' --file ')}`\n \nmodule.exports = {\n  '*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}': [buildEslintCommand],\n}\n```\n\n## [Migrating Existing Config](#migrating-existing-config)\n\n### [Recommended Plugin Ruleset](#recommended-plugin-ruleset)\n\nIf you already have ESLint configured in your application and any of the following conditions are true:\n\n*   You have one or more of the following plugins already installed (either separately or through a different config such as `airbnb` or `react-app`):\n    *   `react`\n    *   `react-hooks`\n    *   `jsx-a11y`\n    *   `import`\n*   You've defined specific `parserOptions` that are different from how Babel is configured within Next.js (this is not recommended unless you have [customized your Babel configuration](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/babel))\n*   You have `eslint-plugin-import` installed with Node.js and/or TypeScript [resolvers](https://github.com/benmosher/eslint-plugin-import#resolvers) defined to handle imports\n\nThen we recommend either removing these settings if you prefer how these properties have been configured within [`eslint-config-next`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/packages/eslint-config-next/index.js) or extending directly from the Next.js ESLint plugin instead:\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  extends: [\n    //...\n    'plugin:@next/next/recommended',\n  ],\n}\n```\n\nThe plugin can be installed normally in your project without needing to run `next lint`:\n\n```\nnpm install --save-dev @next/eslint-plugin-next\n \nyarn add --dev @next/eslint-plugin-next\n \npnpm add --save-dev @next/eslint-plugin-next\n \nbun add --dev @next/eslint-plugin-next\n```\n\nThis eliminates the risk of collisions or errors that can occur due to importing the same plugin or parser across multiple configurations.\n\n### [Additional Configurations](#additional-configurations)\n\nIf you already use a separate ESLint configuration and want to include `eslint-config-next`, ensure that it is extended last after other configurations. For example:\n\n```\n{\n  \"extends\": [\"eslint:recommended\", \"next\"]\n}\n```\n\nThe `next` configuration already handles setting default values for the `parser`, `plugins` and `settings` properties. There is no need to manually re-declare any of these properties unless you need a different configuration for your use case.\n\nIf you include any other shareable configurations, **you will need to make sure that these properties are not overwritten or modified**. Otherwise, we recommend removing any configurations that share behavior with the `next` configuration or extending directly from the Next.js ESLint plugin as mentioned above.",

    "markdown": "# Configuring: Environment Variables | Next.js\n\nExamples\n\n*   [Environment Variables](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/environment-variables)\n\nNext.js comes with built-in support for environment variables, which allows you to do the following:\n\n*   [Use `.env.local` to load environment variables](#loading-environment-variables)\n*   [Bundle environment variables for the browser by prefixing with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`](#bundling-environment-variables-for-the-browser)\n\n## [Loading Environment Variables](#loading-environment-variables)\n\nNext.js has built-in support for loading environment variables from `.env.local` into `process.env`.\n\n```\nDB_HOST=localhost\nDB_USER=myuser\nDB_PASS=mypassword\n```\n\nThis loads `process.env.DB_HOST`, `process.env.DB_USER`, and `process.env.DB_PASS` into the Node.js environment automatically allowing you to use them in [Next.js data fetching methods](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching) and [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes).\n\nFor example, using [`getStaticProps`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-static-props):\n\n```\nexport async function getStaticProps() {\n  const db = await myDB.connect({\n    host: process.env.DB_HOST,\n    username: process.env.DB_USER,\n    password: process.env.DB_PASS,\n  })\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n### [Referencing Other Variables](#referencing-other-variables)\n\nNext.js will automatically expand variables that use `$` to reference other variables e.g. `$VARIABLE` inside of your `.env*` files. This allows you to reference other secrets. For example:\n\n```\nTWITTER_USER=nextjs\nTWITTER_URL=https://twitter.com/$TWITTER_USER\n```\n\nIn the above example, `process.env.TWITTER_URL` would be set to `https://twitter.com/nextjs`.\n\n> **Good to know**: If you need to use variable with a `$` in the actual value, it needs to be escaped e.g. `\\$`.\n\n## [Bundling Environment Variables for the Browser](#bundling-environment-variables-for-the-browser)\n\nNon-`NEXT_PUBLIC_` environment variables are only available in the Node.js environment, meaning they aren't accessible to the browser (the client runs in a different _environment_).\n\nIn order to make the value of an environment variable accessible in the browser, Next.js can \"inline\" a value, at build time, into the js bundle that is delivered to the client, replacing all references to `process.env.[variable]` with a hard-coded value. To tell it to do this, you just have to prefix the variable with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`. For example:\n\n```\nNEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_ID=abcdefghijk\n```\n\nThis will tell Next.js to replace all references to `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_ID` in the Node.js environment with the value from the environment in which you run `next build`, allowing you to use it anywhere in your code. It will be inlined into any JavaScript sent to the browser.\n\n> **Note**: After being built, your app will no longer respond to changes to these environment variables. For instance, if you use a Heroku pipeline to promote slugs built in one environment to another environment, or if you build and deploy a single Docker image to multiple environments, all `NEXT_PUBLIC_` variables will be frozen with the value evaluated at build time, so these values need to be set appropriately when the project is built. If you need access to runtime environment values, you'll have to setup your own API to provide them to the client (either on demand or during initialization).\n\n```\nimport setupAnalyticsService from '../lib/my-analytics-service'\n \n// 'NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_ID' can be used here as it's prefixed by 'NEXT_PUBLIC_'.\n// It will be transformed at build time to `setupAnalyticsService('abcdefghijk')`.\nsetupAnalyticsService(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_ID)\n \nfunction HomePage() {\n  return <h1>Hello World</h1>\n}\n \nexport default HomePage\n```\n\nNote that dynamic lookups will _not_ be inlined, such as:\n\n```\n// This will NOT be inlined, because it uses a variable\nconst varName = 'NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_ID'\nsetupAnalyticsService(process.env[varName])\n \n// This will NOT be inlined, because it uses a variable\nconst env = process.env\nsetupAnalyticsService(env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_ID)\n```\n\n### [Runtime Environment Variables](#runtime-environment-variables)\n\nNext.js can support both build time and runtime environment variables.\n\n**By default, environment variables are only available on the server**. To expose an environment variable to the browser, it must be prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`. However, these public environment variables will be inlined into the JavaScript bundle during `next build`.\n\nTo read runtime environment variables, we recommend using `getServerSideProps` or [incrementally adopting the App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/upgrading/app-router-migration). With the App Router, we can safely read environment variables on the server during dynamic rendering. This allows you to use a singular Docker image that can be promoted through multiple environments with different values.\n\n```\nimport { unstable_noStore as noStore } from 'next/cache'\n \nexport default function Component() {\n  noStore()\n  // cookies(), headers(), and other dynamic functions\n  // will also opt into dynamic rendering, meaning\n  // this env variable is evaluated at runtime\n  const value = process.env.MY_VALUE\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n**Good to know:**\n\n*   You can run code on server startup using the [`register` function](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/instrumentation).\n*   We do not recommend using the [runtimeConfig](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/next-config-js/runtime-configuration) option, as this does not work with the standalone output mode. Instead, we recommend [incrementally adopting](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/upgrading/app-router-migration) the App Router.\n\n## [Default Environment Variables](#default-environment-variables)\n\nIn general only one `.env.local` file is needed. However, sometimes you might want to add some defaults for the `development` (`next dev`) or `production` (`next start`) environment.\n\nNext.js allows you to set defaults in `.env` (all environments), `.env.development` (development environment), and `.env.production` (production environment).\n\n`.env.local` always overrides the defaults set.\n\n> **Good to know**: `.env`, `.env.development`, and `.env.production` files should be included in your repository as they define defaults. **`.env*.local` should be added to `.gitignore`**, as those files are intended to be ignored. `.env.local` is where secrets can be stored.\n\n## [Environment Variables on Vercel](#environment-variables-on-vercel)\n\nWhen deploying your Next.js application to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), Environment Variables can be configured [in the Project Settings](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables?utm_medium=docs&utm_source=next-site&utm_campaign=next-website).\n\nAll types of Environment Variables should be configured there. Even Environment Variables used in Development – which can be [downloaded onto your local device](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/environment-variables#development-environment-variables?utm_source=next-site&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=next-website) afterwards.\n\nIf you've configured [Development Environment Variables](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/environment-variables#development-environment-variables?utm_source=next-site&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=next-website) you can pull them into a `.env.local` for usage on your local machine using the following command:\n\n```\nvercel env pull .env.local\n```\n\n> **Good to know**: When deploying your Next.js application to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), your environment variables in `.env*` files will not be made available to Edge Runtime, unless their name are prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`. We strongly recommend managing your environment variables in [Project Settings](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables?utm_medium=docs&utm_source=next-site&utm_campaign=next-website) instead, from where all environment variables are available.\n\n## [Test Environment Variables](#test-environment-variables)\n\nApart from `development` and `production` environments, there is a 3rd option available: `test`. In the same way you can set defaults for development or production environments, you can do the same with a `.env.test` file for the `testing` environment (though this one is not as common as the previous two). Next.js will not load environment variables from `.env.development` or `.env.production` in the `testing` environment.\n\nThis one is useful when running tests with tools like `jest` or `cypress` where you need to set specific environment vars only for testing purposes. Test default values will be loaded if `NODE_ENV` is set to `test`, though you usually don't need to do this manually as testing tools will address it for you.\n\nThere is a small difference between `test` environment, and both `development` and `production` that you need to bear in mind: `.env.local` won't be loaded, as you expect tests to produce the same results for everyone. This way every test execution will use the same env defaults across different executions by ignoring your `.env.local` (which is intended to override the default set).\n\n> **Good to know**: similar to Default Environment Variables, `.env.test` file should be included in your repository, but `.env.test.local` shouldn't, as `.env*.local` are intended to be ignored through `.gitignore`.\n\nWhile running unit tests you can make sure to load your environment variables the same way Next.js does by leveraging the `loadEnvConfig` function from the `@next/env` package.\n\n```\n// The below can be used in a Jest global setup file or similar for your testing set-up\nimport { loadEnvConfig } from '@next/env'\n \nexport default async () => {\n  const projectDir = process.cwd()\n  loadEnvConfig(projectDir)\n}\n```\n\n## [Environment Variable Load Order](#environment-variable-load-order)\n\nEnvironment variables are looked up in the following places, in order, stopping once the variable is found.\n\n1.  `process.env`\n2.  `.env.$(NODE_ENV).local`\n3.  `.env.local` (Not checked when `NODE_ENV` is `test`.)\n4.  `.env.$(NODE_ENV)`\n5.  `.env`\n\nFor example, if `NODE_ENV` is `development` and you define a variable in both `.env.development.local` and `.env`, the value in `.env.development.local` will be used.\n\n> **Good to know**: The allowed values for `NODE_ENV` are `production`, `development` and `test`.\n\n## [Good to know](#good-to-know)\n\n*   If you are using a [`/src` directory](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/src-directory), `.env.*` files should remain in the root of your project.\n*   If the environment variable `NODE_ENV` is unassigned, Next.js automatically assigns `development` when running the `next dev` command, or `production` for all other commands.\n\n## [Version History](#version-history)\n\n| Version | Changes |\n| --- | --- |\n| `v9.4.0` | Support `.env` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_` introduced. |",

For example:\n\n```\n// before\nimport { Button } from '../../../components/button'\n \n// after\nimport { Button } from '@/components/button'\n```\n\n> **Good to know**: `create-next-app` will prompt to configure these options for you.\n\n## [Absolute Imports](#absolute-imports)\n\nThe `baseUrl` configuration option allows you to import directly from the root of the project.\n\nAn example of this configuration:\n\n```\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"baseUrl\": \".\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n```\nexport default function Button() {\n  return <button>Click me</button>\n}\n```\n\n```\nimport Button from 'components/button'\n \nexport default function HomePage() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h1>Hello World</h1>\n      <Button />\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n## [Module Aliases](#module-aliases)\n\nIn addition to configuring the `baseUrl` path, you can use the `\"paths\"` option to \"alias\" module paths.\n\nFor example, the following configuration maps `@/components/*` to `components/*`:\n\n```\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"baseUrl\": \".\",\n    \"paths\": {\n      \"@/components/*\": [\"components/*\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n```\nexport default function Button() {\n  return <button>Click me</button>\n}\n```\n\n```\nimport Button from '@/components/button'\n \nexport default function HomePage() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <h1>Hello World</h1>\n      <Button />\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nEach of the `\"paths\"` are relative to the `baseUrl` location.

This can be either an absolute external URL, or an internal path depending on the [loader](#loader) prop.\n\nWhen using an external URL, you must add it to [remotePatterns](#remotepatterns) in `next.config.js`.\n\n### [`width`](#width)\n\nThe `width` property represents the _rendered_ width in pixels, so it will affect how large the image appears.\n\nRequired, except for [statically imported images](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/images#local-images) or images with the [`fill` property](#fill).\n\n### [`height`](#height)\n\nThe `height` property represents the _rendered_ height in pixels, so it will affect how large the image appears.\n\nRequired, except for [statically imported images](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/images#local-images) or images with the [`fill` property](#fill).\n\n### [`alt`](#alt)\n\nThe `alt` property is used to describe the image for screen readers and search engines. It is also the fallback text if images have been disabled or an error occurs while loading the image.\n\nIt should contain text that could replace the image [without changing the meaning of the page](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/images.html#general-guidelines). It is not meant to supplement the image and should not repeat information that is already provided in the captions above or below the image.\n\nIf the image is [purely decorative](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/images.html#a-purely-decorative-image-that-doesn't-add-any-information) or [not intended for the user](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/images.html#an-image-not-intended-for-the-user), the `alt` property should be an empty string (`alt=\"\"`).\n\n[Learn more](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/images.html#alt)\n\n## [Optional Props](#optional-props)\n\nThe `<Image />` component accepts a number of additional properties beyond those which are required. This section describes the most commonly-used properties of the Image component. Find details about more rarely-used properties in the [Advanced Props](#advanced-props) section.\n\n### [`loader`](#loader)\n\nA custom function used to resolve image URLs.\n\nA `loader` is a function returning a URL string for the image, given the following parameters:\n\n*   [`src`](#src)\n*   [`width`](#width)\n*   [`quality`](#quality)\n\nHere is an example of using a custom loader:\n\n```\nimport Image from 'next/image'\n \nconst imageLoader = ({ src, width, quality }) => {\n  return `https://example.com/${src}?w=${width}&q=${quality || 75}`\n}\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <Image\n      loader={imageLoader}\n      src=\"me.png\"\n      alt=\"Picture of the author\"\n      width={500}\n      height={500}\n    />\n  )\n}\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can use the [loaderFile](#loaderfile) configuration in `next.config.js` to configure every instance of `next/image` in your application, without passing a prop.\n\n### [`fill`](#fill)\n\n```\nfill={true} // {true} | {false}\n```\n\nA boolean that causes the image to fill the parent element, which is useful when the [`width`](#width) and [`height`](#height) are unknown.\n\nThe parent element _must_ assign `position: \"relative\"`, `position: \"fixed\"`, or `position: \"absolute\"` style.\n\nBy default, the img element will automatically be assigned the `position: \"absolute\"` style.\n\nIf no styles are applied to the image, the image will stretch to fit the container. You may prefer to set `object-fit: \"contain\"` for an image which is letterboxed to fit the container and preserve aspect ratio.\n\nAlternatively, `object-fit: \"cover\"` will cause the image to fill the entire container and be cropped to preserve aspect ratio. For this to look correct, the `overflow: \"hidden\"` style should be assigned to the parent element.\n\nFor more information, see also:\n\n*   [`position`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/position)\n*   [`object-fit`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/object-fit)\n*   [`object-position`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/object-position)\n\n### [`sizes`](#sizes)\n\nA string, similar to a media query, that provides information about how wide the image will be at different breakpoints. The value of `sizes` will greatly affect performance for images using [`fill`](#fill) or which are [styled to have a responsive size](#responsive-images).\n\nThe `sizes` property serves two important purposes related to image performance:\n\n*   First, the value of `sizes` is used by the browser to determine which size of the image to download, from `next/image`'s automatically generated `srcset`. When the browser chooses, it does not yet know the size of the image on the page, so it selects an image that is the same size or larger than the viewport. The `sizes` property allows you to tell the browser that the image will actually be smaller than full screen. If you don't specify a `sizes` value in an image with the `fill` property, a default value of `100vw` (full screen width) is used.\n*   Second, the `sizes` property changes the behavior of the automatically generated `srcset` value. If no `sizes` value is present, a small `srcset` is generated, suitable for a fixed-size image (1x/2x/etc). If `sizes` is defined, a large `srcset` is generated, suitable for a responsive image (640w/750w/etc). If the `sizes` property includes sizes such as `50vw`, which represent a percentage of the viewport width, then the `srcset` is trimmed to not include any values which are too small to ever be necessary.\n\nFor example, if you know your styling will cause an image to be full-width on mobile devices, in a 2-column layout on tablets, and a 3-column layout on desktop displays, you should include a sizes property such as the following:\n\n```\nimport Image from 'next/image'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"grid-element\">\n      <Image\n        fill\n        src=\"/example.png\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, (max-width: 1200px) 50vw, 33vw\"\n      />\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nThis example `sizes` could have a dramatic effect on performance metrics. Without the `33vw` sizes, the image selected from the server would be 3 times as wide as it needs to be. Because file size is proportional to the square of the width, without `sizes` the user would download an image that's 9 times larger than necessary.\n\nLearn more about `srcset` and `sizes`:\n\n*   [web.dev](https://web.dev/learn/design/responsive-images/#sizes)\n*   [mdn](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img#sizes)\n\n### [`quality`](#quality)\n\n```\nquality={75} // {number 1-100}\n```\n\nThe quality of the optimized image, an integer between `1` and `100`, where `100` is the best quality and therefore largest file size. Defaults to `75`.\n\n### [`priority`](#priority)\n\n```\npriority={false} // {false} | {true}\n```\n\nWhen true, the image will be considered high priority and [preload](https://web.dev/preload-responsive-images/). Lazy loading is automatically disabled for images using `priority`.\n\nYou should use the `priority` property on any image detected as the [Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)](https://nextjs.org/learn/seo/web-performance/lcp) element. It may be appropriate to have multiple priority images, as different images may be the LCP element for different viewport sizes.\n\nShould only be used when the image is visible above the fold. Defaults to `false`.\n\n### [`placeholder`](#placeholder)\n\n```\nplaceholder = 'empty' // \"empty\" | \"blur\" | \"data:image/...\"\n```\n\nA placeholder to use while the image is loading. Possible values are `blur`, `empty`, or `data:image/...`. Defaults to `empty`.\n\nWhen `blur`, the [`blurDataURL`](#blurdataurl) property will be used as the placeholder. If `src` is an object from a [static import](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/images#local-images) and the imported image is `.jpg`, `.png`, `.webp`, or `.avif`, then `blurDataURL` will be automatically populated, except when the image is detected to be animated.\n\nFor dynamic images, you must provide the [`blurDataURL`](#blurdataurl) property. Solutions such as [Plaiceholder](https://github.com/joe-bell/plaiceholder) can help with `base64` generation.\n\nWhen `data:image/...`, the [Data URL](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/Data_URIs) will be used as the placeholder while the image is loading.\n\nWhen `empty`, there will be no placeholder while the image is loading, only empty space.\n\nTry it out:\n\n*   [Demo the `blur` placeholder](https://image-component.nextjs.gallery/placeholder)\n*   [Demo the shimmer effect with data URL `placeholder` prop](https://image-component.nextjs.gallery/shimmer)\n*   [Demo the color effect with `blurDataURL` prop](https://image-component.nextjs.gallery/color)\n\n## [Advanced Props](#advanced-props)\n\nIn some cases, you may need more advanced usage. The `<Image />` component optionally accepts the following advanced properties.\n\n### [`style`](#style)\n\nAllows passing CSS styles to the underlying image element.\n\n```\nconst imageStyle = {\n  borderRadius: '50%',\n  border: '1px solid #fff',\n}\n \nexport default function ProfileImage() {\n  return <Image src=\"...\" style={imageStyle} />\n}\n```\n\nRemember that the required width and height props can interact with your styling. If you use styling to modify an image's width, you should also style its height to `auto` to preserve its intrinsic aspect ratio, or your image will be distorted.\n\n### [`onLoadingComplete`](#onloadingcomplete)\n\n```\n<Image onLoadingComplete={(img) => console.log(img.naturalWidth)} />\n```\n\n> **Warning**: Deprecated since Next.js 14 in favor of [`onLoad`](#onload).\n\nA callback function that is invoked once the image is completely loaded and the [placeholder](#placeholder) has been removed.\n\nThe callback function will be called with one argument, a reference to the underlying `<img>` element.\n\n### [`onLoad`](#onload)\n\n```\n<Image onLoad={(e) => console.log(e.target.naturalWidth)} />\n```\n\nA callback function that is invoked once the image is completely loaded and the [placeholder](#placeholder) has been removed.\n\nThe callback function will be called with one argument, the Event which has a `target` that references the underlying `<img>` element.\n\n### [`onError`](#onerror)\n\n```\n<Image onError={(e) => console.error(e.target.id)} />\n```\n\nA callback function that is invoked if the image fails to load.\n\n### [`loading`](#loading)\n\n> **Recommendation**: This property is only meant for advanced use cases. Switching an image to load with `eager` will normally **hurt performance**. We recommend using the [`priority`](#priority) property instead, which will eagerly preload the image.\n\n```\nloading = 'lazy' // {lazy} | {eager}\n```\n\nThe loading behavior of the image. Defaults to `lazy`.\n\nWhen `lazy`, defer loading the image until it reaches a calculated distance from the viewport.\n\nWhen `eager`, load the image immediately.\n\nLearn more about the [`loading` attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img#loading).\n\n### [`blurDataURL`](#blurdataurl)\n\nA [Data URL](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/Data_URIs) to be used as a placeholder image before the `src` image successfully loads. Only takes effect when combined with [`placeholder=\"blur\"`](#placeholder).\n\nMust be a base64-encoded image. It will be enlarged and blurred, so a very small image (10px or less) is recommended. Including larger images as placeholders may harm your application performance.\n\nTry it out:\n\n*   [Demo the default `blurDataURL` prop](https://image-component.nextjs.gallery/placeholder)\n*   [Demo the color effect with `blurDataURL` prop](https://image-component.nextjs.gallery/color)\n\nYou can also [generate a solid color Data URL](https://png-pixel.com/) to match the image.\n\n### [`unoptimized`](#unoptimized)\n\n```\nunoptimized = {false} // {false} | {true}\n```\n\nWhen true, the source image will be served as-is instead of changing quality, size, or format. Defaults to `false`.\n\n```\nimport Image from 'next/image'\n \nconst UnoptimizedImage = (props) => {\n  return <Image {...props} unoptimized />\n}\n```\n\nSince Next.js 12.3.0, this prop can be assigned to all images by updating `next.config.js` with the following configuration:\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    unoptimized: true,\n  },\n}\n```\n\n### [`overrideSrc`](#overridesrc)\n\nWhen providing the `src` prop to the `<Image>` component, both the `srcset` and `src` attributes are generated automatically for the resulting `<img>`.\n\n```\n<img\n  srcset=\"\n    /_next/image?url=%2Fme.jpg&w=640&q=75 1x,\n    /_next/image?url=%2Fme.jpg&w=828&q=75 2x\n  \"\n  src=\"/_next/image?url=%2Fme.jpg&w=828&q=75\"\n/>\n```\n\nIn some cases, it is not desirable to have the `src` attribute generated and you may wish to override it using the `overrideSrc` prop.\n\nFor example, when upgrading an existing website from `<img>` to `<Image>`, you may wish to maintain the same `src` attribute for SEO purposes such as image ranking or avoiding recrawl.\n\n```\n<Image src=\"/me.jpg\" overrideSrc=\"/override.jpg\" />\n```\n\n```\n<img\n  srcset=\"\n    /_next/image?url=%2Fme.jpg&w=640&q=75 1x,\n    /_next/image?url=%2Fme.jpg&w=828&q=75 2x\n  \"\n  src=\"/override.jpg\"\n/>\n```\n\n### [Other Props](#other-props)\n\nOther properties on the `<Image />` component will be passed to the underlying `img` element with the exception of the following:\n\n*   `srcSet`. Use [Device Sizes](#devicesizes) instead.\n*   `decoding`. It is always `\"async\"`.\n\n## [Configuration Options](#configuration-options)\n\nIn addition to props, you can configure the Image Component in `next.config.js`. The following options are available:\n\n### [`remotePatterns`](#remotepatterns)\n\nTo protect your application from malicious users, configuration is required in order to use external images. This ensures that only external images from your account can be served from the Next.js Image Optimization API. These external images can be configured with the `remotePatterns` property in your `next.config.js` file, as shown below:\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    remotePatterns: [\n      {\n        protocol: 'https',\n        hostname: 'example.com',\n        port: '',\n        pathname: '/account123/**',\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n}\n```\n\n> **Good to know**: The example above will ensure the `src` property of `next/image` must start with `https://example.com/account123/`. Any other protocol, hostname, port, or unmatched path will respond with 400 Bad Request.\n\nBelow is another example of the `remotePatterns` property in the `next.config.js` file:\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    remotePatterns: [\n      {\n        protocol: 'https',\n        hostname: '**.example.com',\n        port: '',\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n}\n```\n\n> **Good to know**: The example above will ensure the `src` property of `next/image` must start with `https://img1.example.com` or `https://me.avatar.example.com` or any number of subdomains. Any other protocol, port, or unmatched hostname will respond with 400 Bad Request.\n\nWildcard patterns can be used for both `pathname` and `hostname` and have the following syntax:\n\n*   `*` match a single path segment or subdomain\n*   `**` match any number of path segments at the end or subdomains at the beginning\n\nThe `**` syntax does not work in the middle of the pattern.\n\n> **Good to know**: When omitting `protocol`, `port` or `pathname`, then the wildcard `**` is implied. This is not recommended because it may allow malicious actors to optimize urls you did not intend.\n\n### [`domains`](#domains)\n\n> **Warning**: Deprecated since Next.js 14 in favor of strict [`remotePatterns`](#remotepatterns) in order to protect your application from malicious users. Only use `domains` if you own all the content served from the domain.\n\nSimilar to [`remotePatterns`](#remotepatterns), the `domains` configuration can be used to provide a list of allowed hostnames for external images.\n\nHowever, the `domains` configuration does not support wildcard pattern matching and it cannot restrict protocol, port, or pathname.\n\nBelow is an example of the `domains` property in the `next.config.js` file:\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    domains: ['assets.acme.com'],\n  },\n}\n```\n\n### [`loaderFile`](#loaderfile)\n\nIf you want to use a cloud provider to optimize images instead of using the Next.js built-in Image Optimization API, you can configure the `loaderFile` in your `next.config.js` like the following:\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    loader: 'custom',\n    loaderFile: './my/image/loader.js',\n  },\n}\n```\n\nThis must point to a file relative to the root of your Next.js application. The file must export a default function that returns a string, for example:\n\n```\nexport default function myImageLoader({ src, width, quality }) {\n  return `https://example.com/${src}?w=${width}&q=${quality || 75}`\n}\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can use the [`loader` prop](#loader) to configure each instance of `next/image`.\n\nExamples:\n\n*   [Custom Image Loader Configuration](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/images#example-loader-configuration)\n\n## [Advanced](#advanced)\n\nThe following configuration is for advanced use cases and is usually not necessary. If you choose to configure the properties below, you will override any changes to the Next.js defaults in future updates.\n\n### [`deviceSizes`](#devicesizes)\n\nIf you know the expected device widths of your users, you can specify a list of device width breakpoints using the `deviceSizes` property in `next.config.js`. These widths are used when the `next/image` component uses [`sizes`](#sizes) prop to ensure the correct image is served for user's device.\n\nIf no configuration is provided, the default below is used.\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    deviceSizes: [640, 750, 828, 1080, 1200, 1920, 2048, 3840],\n  },\n}\n```\n\n### [`imageSizes`](#imagesizes)\n\nYou can specify a list of image widths using the `images.imageSizes` property in your `next.config.js` file. These widths are concatenated with the array of [device sizes](#devicesizes) to form the full array of sizes used to generate image [srcset](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/HTMLImageElement/srcset)s.\n\nThe reason there are two separate lists is that imageSizes is only used for images which provide a [`sizes`](#sizes) prop, which indicates that the image is less than the full width of the screen. **Therefore, the sizes in imageSizes should all be smaller than the smallest size in deviceSizes.**\n\nIf no configuration is provided, the default below is used.\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    imageSizes: [16, 32, 48, 64, 96, 128, 256, 384],\n  },\n}\n```\n\n### [`formats`](#formats)\n\nThe default [Image Optimization API](#loader) will automatically detect the browser's supported image formats via the request's `Accept` header.\n\nIf the `Accept` head matches more than one of the configured formats, the first match in the array is used. Therefore, the array order matters. If there is no match (or the source image is [animated](#animated-images)), the Image Optimization API will fallback to the original image's format.\n\nIf no configuration is provided, the default below is used.\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    formats: ['image/webp'],\n  },\n}\n```\n\nYou can enable AVIF support with the following configuration.\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    formats: ['image/avif', 'image/webp'],\n  },\n}\n```\n\n> **Good to know**:\n> \n> *   AVIF generally takes 20% longer to encode but it compresses 20% smaller compared to WebP. This means that the first time an image is requested, it will typically be slower and then subsequent requests that are cached will be faster.\n> *   If you self-host with a Proxy/CDN in front of Next.js, you must configure the Proxy to forward the `Accept` header.\n\n## [Caching Behavior](#caching-behavior)\n\nThe following describes the caching algorithm for the default [loader](#loader). For all other loaders, please refer to your cloud provider's documentation.\n\nImages are optimized dynamically upon request and stored in the `<distDir>/cache/images` directory. The optimized image file will be served for subsequent requests until the expiration is reached. When a request is made that matches a cached but expired file, the expired image is served stale immediately. Then the image is optimized again in the background (also called revalidation) and saved to the cache with the new expiration date.\n\nThe cache status of an image can be determined by reading the value of the `x-nextjs-cache` response header. The possible values are the following:\n\n*   `MISS` - the path is not in the cache (occurs at most once, on the first visit)\n*   `STALE` - the path is in the cache but exceeded the revalidate time so it will be updated in the background\n*   `HIT` - the path is in the cache and has not exceeded the revalidate time\n\nThe expiration (or rather Max Age) is defined by either the [`minimumCacheTTL`](#minimumcachettl) configuration or the upstream image `Cache-Control` header, whichever is larger. Specifically, the `max-age` value of the `Cache-Control` header is used. If both `s-maxage` and `max-age` are found, then `s-maxage` is preferred. The `max-age` is also passed-through to any downstream clients including CDNs and browsers.\n\n*   You can configure [`minimumCacheTTL`](#minimumcachettl) to increase the cache duration when the upstream image does not include `Cache-Control` header or the value is very low.\n*   You can configure [`deviceSizes`](#devicesizes) and [`imageSizes`](#imagesizes) to reduce the total number of possible generated images.\n*   You can configure [formats](#formats) to disable multiple formats in favor of a single image format.\n\n### [`minimumCacheTTL`](#minimumcachettl)\n\nYou can configure the Time to Live (TTL) in seconds for cached optimized images. In many cases, it's better to use a [Static Image Import](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/images#local-images) which will automatically hash the file contents and cache the image forever with a `Cache-Control` header of `immutable`.\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    minimumCacheTTL: 60,\n  },\n}\n```\n\nThe expiration (or rather Max Age) of the optimized image is defined by either the `minimumCacheTTL` or the upstream image `Cache-Control` header, whichever is larger.\n\nIf you need to change the caching behavior per image, you can configure [`headers`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/headers) to set the `Cache-Control` header on the upstream image (e.g. `/some-asset.jpg`, not `/_next/image` itself).\n\nThere is no mechanism to invalidate the cache at this time, so its best to keep `minimumCacheTTL` low. Otherwise you may need to manually change the [`src`](#src) prop or delete `<distDir>/cache/images`.\n\n### [`disableStaticImages`](#disablestaticimages)\n\nThe default behavior allows you to import static files such as `import icon from './icon.png'` and then pass that to the `src` property.\n\nIn some cases, you may wish to disable this feature if it conflicts with other plugins that expect the import to behave differently.\n\nYou can disable static image imports inside your `next.config.js`:\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    disableStaticImages: true,\n  },\n}\n```\n\n### [`dangerouslyAllowSVG`](#dangerouslyallowsvg)\n\nThe default [loader](#loader) does not optimize SVG images for a few reasons. First, SVG is a vector format meaning it can be resized losslessly. Second, SVG has many of the same features as HTML/CSS, which can lead to vulnerabilities without proper [Content Security Policy (CSP) headers](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/headers#content-security-policy).\n\nTherefore, we recommended using the [`unoptimized`](#unoptimized) prop when the [`src`](#src) prop is known to be SVG. This happens automatically when `src` ends with `\".svg\"`.\n\nHowever, if you need to serve SVG images with the default Image Optimization API, you can set `dangerouslyAllowSVG` inside your `next.config.js`:\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    dangerouslyAllowSVG: true,\n    contentDispositionType: 'attachment',\n    contentSecurityPolicy: \"default-src 'self'; script-src 'none'; sandbox;\",\n  },\n}\n```\n\nIn addition, it is strongly recommended to also set `contentDispositionType` to force the browser to download the image, as well as `contentSecurityPolicy` to prevent scripts embedded in the image from executing.\n\n## [Animated Images](#animated-images)\n\nThe default [loader](#loader) will automatically bypass Image Optimization for animated images and serve the image as-is.\n\nAuto-detection for animated files is best-effort and supports GIF, APNG, and WebP. If you want to explicitly bypass Image Optimization for a given animated image, use the [unoptimized](#unoptimized) prop.\n\n## [Responsive Images](#responsive-images)\n\nThe default generated `srcset` contains `1x` and `2x` images in order to support different device pixel ratios. However, you may wish to render a responsive image that stretches with the viewport. In that case, you'll need to set [`sizes`](#sizes) as well as `style` (or `className`).\n\nYou can render a responsive image using one of the following methods below.\n\n### [Responsive image using a static import](#responsive-image-using-a-static-import)\n\nIf the source image is not dynamic, you can statically import to create a responsive image:\n\n```\nimport Image from 'next/image'\nimport me from '../photos/me.jpg'\n \nexport default function Author() {\n  return (\n    <Image\n      src={me}\n      alt=\"Picture of the author\"\n      sizes=\"100vw\"\n      style={{\n        width: '100%',\n        height: 'auto',\n      }}\n    />\n  )\n}\n```\n\nTry it out:\n\n*   [Demo the image responsive to viewport](https://image-component.nextjs.gallery/responsive)\n\n### [Responsive image with aspect ratio](#responsive-image-with-aspect-ratio)\n\nIf the source image is a dynamic or a remote url, you will also need to provide `width` and `height` to set the correct aspect ratio of the responsive image:\n\n```\nimport Image from 'next/image'\n \nexport default function Page({ photoUrl }) {\n  return (\n    <Image\n      src={photoUrl}\n      alt=\"Picture of the author\"\n      sizes=\"100vw\"\n      style={{\n        width: '100%',\n        height: 'auto',\n      }}\n      width={500}\n      height={300}\n    />\n  )\n}\n```\n\nTry it out:\n\n*   [Demo the image responsive to viewport](https://image-component.nextjs.gallery/responsive)\n\n### [Responsive image with `fill`](#responsive-image-with-fill)\n\nIf you don't know the aspect ratio, you will need to set the [`fill`](#fill) prop and set `position: relative` on the parent. Optionally, you can set `object-fit` style depending on the desired stretch vs crop behavior:\n\n```\nimport Image from 'next/image'\n \nexport default function Page({ photoUrl }) {\n  return (\n    <div style={{ position: 'relative', width: '300px', height: '500px' }}>\n      <Image\n        src={photoUrl}\n        alt=\"Picture of the author\"\n        sizes=\"300px\"\n        fill\n        style={{\n          objectFit: 'contain',\n        }}\n      />\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nTry it out:\n\n*   [Demo the `fill` prop](https://image-component.nextjs.gallery/fill)\n\n## [Theme Detection CSS](#theme-detection-css)\n\nIf you want to display a different image for light and dark mode, you can create a new component that wraps two `<Image>` components and reveals the correct one based on a CSS media query.\n\n```\n.imgDark {\n  display: none;\n}\n \n@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {\n  .imgLight {\n    display: none;\n  }\n  .imgDark {\n    display: unset;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n```\nimport styles from './theme-image.module.css'\nimport Image, { ImageProps } from 'next/image'\n \ntype Props = Omit<ImageProps, 'src' | 'priority' | 'loading'> & {\n  srcLight: string\n  srcDark: string\n}\n \nconst ThemeImage = (props: Props) => {\n  const { srcLight, srcDark, ...rest } = props\n \n  return (\n    <>\n      <Image {...rest} src={srcLight} className={styles.imgLight} />\n      <Image {...rest} src={srcDark} className={styles.imgDark} />\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n> **Good to know**: The default behavior of `loading=\"lazy\"` ensures that only the correct image is loaded. You cannot use `priority` or `loading=\"eager\"` because that would cause both images to load. Instead, you can use [`fetchPriority=\"high\"`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/HTMLImageElement/fetchPriority).\n\nTry it out:\n\n*   [Demo light/dark mode theme detection](https://image-component.nextjs.gallery/theme)\n\n## [getImageProps](#getimageprops)\n\nFor more advanced use cases, you can call `getImageProps()` to get the props that would be passed to the underlying `<img>` element, and instead pass to them to another component, style, canvas, etc.\n\nThis also avoid calling React `useState()` so it can lead to better performance, but it cannot be used with the [`placeholder`](#placeholder) prop because the placeholder will never be removed.\n\n### [Theme Detection Picture](#theme-detection-picture)\n\nIf you want to display a different image for light and dark mode, you can use the [`<picture>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/picture) element to display a different image based on the user's [preferred color scheme](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme).\n\n```\nimport { getImageProps } from 'next/image'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  const common = { alt: 'Theme Example', width: 800, height: 400 }\n  const {\n    props: { srcSet: dark },\n  } = getImageProps({ ...common, src: '/dark.png' })\n  const {\n    props: { srcSet: light, ...rest },\n  } = getImageProps({ ...common, src: '/light.png' })\n \n  return (\n    <picture>\n      <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcSet={dark} />\n      <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcSet={light} />\n      <img {...rest} />\n    </picture>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n### [Art Direction](#art-direction)\n\nIf you want to display a different image for mobile and desktop, sometimes called [Art Direction](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images#art_direction), you can provide different `src`, `width`, `height`, and `quality` props to `getImageProps()`.\n\n```\nimport { getImageProps } from 'next/image'\n \nexport default function Home() {\n  const common = { alt: 'Art Direction Example', sizes: '100vw' }\n  const {\n    props: { srcSet: desktop },\n  } = getImageProps({\n    ...common,\n    width: 1440,\n    height: 875,\n    quality: 80,\n    src: '/desktop.jpg',\n  })\n  const {\n    props: { srcSet: mobile, ...rest },\n  } = getImageProps({\n    ...common,\n    width: 750,\n    height: 1334,\n    quality: 70,\n    src: '/mobile.jpg',\n  })\n \n  return (\n    <picture>\n      <source media=\"(min-width: 1000px)\" srcSet={desktop} />\n      <source media=\"(min-width: 500px)\" srcSet={mobile} />\n      <img {...rest} style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }} />\n    </picture>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n### [Background CSS](#background-css)\n\nYou can even convert the `srcSet` string to the [`image-set()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/image/image-set) CSS function to optimize a background image.\n\n```\nimport { getImageProps } from 'next/image'\n \nfunction getBackgroundImage(srcSet = '') {\n  const imageSet = srcSet\n    .split(', ')\n    .map((str) => {\n      const [url, dpi] = str.split(' ')\n      return `url(\"${url}\") ${dpi}`\n    })\n    .join(', ')\n  return `image-set(${imageSet})`\n}\n \nexport default function Home() {\n  const {\n    props: { srcSet },\n  } = getImageProps({ alt: '', width: 128, height: 128, src: '/img.png' })\n  const backgroundImage = getBackgroundImage(srcSet)\n  const style = { height: '100vh', width: '100vw', backgroundImage }\n \n  return (\n    <main style={style}>\n      <h1>Hello World</h1>\n    </main>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n## [Known Browser Bugs](#known-browser-bugs)\n\nThis `next/image` component uses browser native [lazy loading](https://caniuse.com/loading-lazy-attr), which may fallback to eager loading for older browsers before Safari 15.4. When using the blur-up placeholder, older browsers before Safari 12 will fallback to empty placeholder. When using styles with `width`/`height` of `auto`, it is possible to cause [Layout Shift](https://web.dev/cls/) on older browsers before Safari 15 that don't [preserve the aspect ratio](https://caniuse.com/mdn-html_elements_img_aspect_ratio_computed_from_attributes). For more details, see [this MDN video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-d_SoCHeWE).\n\n*   [Safari 15 - 16.3](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=243601) display a gray border while loading.

Possible solutions:\n    *   Use CSS `@supports (font: -apple-system-body) and (-webkit-appearance: none) { img[loading=\"lazy\"] { clip-path: inset(0.6px) } }`\n    *   Use [`priority`](#priority) if the image is above the fold\n*   [Firefox 67+](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1556156) displays a white background while loading.

By breaking a strict SPA into individual HTML files, Next.js can avoid loading unnecessary JavaScript code on the client-side, reducing the bundle size and enabling faster page loads.\n\nSince Next.js supports this static export, it can be deployed and hosted on any web server that can serve HTML/CSS/JS static assets.\n\n> **Good to know**: We recommend using the App Router for enhanced static export support.\n\n## [Configuration](#configuration)\n\nTo enable a static export, change the output mode inside `next.config.js`:\n\n```\n/**\n * @type {import('next').NextConfig}\n */\nconst nextConfig = {\n  output: 'export',\n \n  // Optional: Change links `/me` -> `/me/` and emit `/me.html` -> `/me/index.html`\n  // trailingSlash: true,\n \n  // Optional: Prevent automatic `/me` -> `/me/`, instead preserve `href`\n  // skipTrailingSlashRedirect: true,\n \n  // Optional: Change the output directory `out` -> `dist`\n  // distDir: 'dist',\n}\n \nmodule.exports = nextConfig\n```\n\nAfter running `next build`, Next.js will produce an `out` folder which contains the HTML/CSS/JS assets for your application.\n\nYou can utilize [`getStaticProps`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-static-props) and [`getStaticPaths`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-static-paths) to generate an HTML file for each page in your `pages` directory (or more for [dynamic routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes)).\n\n## [Supported Features](#supported-features-1)\n\nThe majority of core Next.js features needed to build a static site are supported, including:\n\n*   [Dynamic Routes when using `getStaticPaths`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes)\n*   Prefetching with `next/link`\n*   Preloading JavaScript\n*   [Dynamic Imports](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/lazy-loading)\n*   Any styling options (e.g. CSS Modules, styled-jsx)\n*   [Client-side data fetching](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/client-side)\n*   [`getStaticProps`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-static-props)\n*   [`getStaticPaths`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-static-paths)\n\n### [Image Optimization](#image-optimization)\n\n[Image Optimization](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/images) through `next/image` can be used with a static export by defining a custom image loader in `next.config.js`. For example, you can optimize images with a service like Cloudinary:\n\n```\n/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */\nconst nextConfig = {\n  output: 'export',\n  images: {\n    loader: 'custom',\n    loaderFile: './my-loader.ts',\n  },\n}\n \nmodule.exports = nextConfig\n```\n\nThis custom loader will define how to fetch images from a remote source. For example, the following loader will construct the URL for Cloudinary:\n\n```\nexport default function cloudinaryLoader({\n  src,\n  width,\n  quality,\n}: {\n  src: string\n  width: number\n  quality?: number\n}) {\n  const params = ['f_auto', 'c_limit', `w_${width}`, `q_${quality || 'auto'}`]\n  return `https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/${params.join(\n    ','\n  )}${src}`\n}\n```\n\nYou can then use `next/image` in your application, defining relative paths to the image in Cloudinary:\n\n```\nimport Image from 'next/image'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return <Image alt=\"turtles\" src=\"/turtles.jpg\" width={300} height={300} />\n}\n```\n\n## [Unsupported Features](#unsupported-features)\n\nFeatures that require a Node.js server, or dynamic logic that cannot be computed during the build process, are **not** supported:\n\n*   [Internationalized Routing](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/internationalization)\n*   [API Routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes)\n*   [Rewrites](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/next-config-js/rewrites)\n*   [Redirects](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/next-config-js/redirects)\n*   [Headers](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/next-config-js/headers)\n*   [Middleware](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/middleware)\n*   [Incremental Static Regeneration](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/incremental-static-regeneration)\n*   [Image Optimization](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/images) with the default `loader`\n*   [Draft Mode](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/draft-mode)\n*   [`getStaticPaths` with `fallback: true`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/get-static-paths#fallback-true)\n*   [`getStaticPaths` with `fallback: 'blocking'`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/get-static-paths#fallback-blocking)\n*   [`getServerSideProps`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-server-side-props)\n\n## [Deploying](#deploying)\n\nWith a static export, Next.js can be deployed and hosted on any web server that can serve HTML/CSS/JS static assets.\n\nWhen running `next build`, Next.js generates the static export into the `out` folder. For example, let's say you have the following routes:\n\n*   `/`\n*   `/blog/[id]`\n\nAfter running `next build`, Next.js will generate the following files:\n\n*   `/out/index.html`\n*   `/out/404.html`\n*   `/out/blog/post-1.html`\n*   `/out/blog/post-2.html`\n\nIf you are using a static host like Nginx, you can configure rewrites from incoming requests to the correct files:\n\n```\nserver {\n  listen 80;\n  server_name acme.com;\n \n  root /var/www/out;\n \n  location / {\n      try_files $uri $uri.html $uri/ =404;\n  }\n \n  # This is necessary when `trailingSlash: false`.\n  # You can omit this when `trailingSlash: true`.\n  location /blog/ {\n      rewrite ^/blog/(.*)$ /blog/$1.html break;\n  }\n \n  error_page 404 /404.html;\n  location = /404.html {\n      internal;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## [Version History](#version-history)\n\n| Version | Changes |\n| --- | --- |\n| `v14.0.0` | `next export` has been removed in favor of `\"output\": \"export\"` |\n| `v13.4.0` | App Router (Stable) adds enhanced static export support, including using React Server Components and Route Handlers. |\n| `v13.3.0` | `next export` is deprecated and replaced with `\"output\": \"export\"` |",

    "markdown": "# Components: <Script> | Next.js\n\nThis API reference will help you understand how to use [props](#props) available for the Script Component. For features and usage, please see the [Optimizing Scripts](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/scripts) page.\n\n```\nimport Script from 'next/script'\n \nexport default function Dashboard() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Script src=\"https://example.com/script.js\" />\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n## [Props](#props)\n\nHere's a summary of the props available for the Script Component:\n\n| Prop | Example | Type | Required |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| [`src`](#src) | `src=\"http://example.com/script\"` | String | Required unless inline script is used |\n| [`strategy`](#strategy) | `strategy=\"lazyOnload\"` | String | \\-  |\n| [`onLoad`](#onload) | `onLoad={onLoadFunc}` | Function | \\-  |\n| [`onReady`](#onready) | `onReady={onReadyFunc}` | Function | \\-  |\n| [`onError`](#onerror) | `onError={onErrorFunc}` | Function | \\-  |\n\n## [Required Props](#required-props)\n\nThe `<Script />` component requires the following properties.\n\n### [`src`](#src)\n\nA path string specifying the URL of an external script. This can be either an absolute external URL or an internal path. The `src` property is required unless an inline script is used.\n\n## [Optional Props](#optional-props)\n\nThe `<Script />` component accepts a number of additional properties beyond those which are required.\n\n### [`strategy`](#strategy)\n\nThe loading strategy of the script. There are four different strategies that can be used:\n\n*   `beforeInteractive`: Load before any Next.js code and before any page hydration occurs.\n*   `afterInteractive`: (**default**) Load early but after some hydration on the page occurs.\n*   `lazyOnload`: Load during browser idle time.\n*   `worker`: (experimental) Load in a web worker.\n\n### [`beforeInteractive`](#beforeinteractive)\n\nScripts that load with the `beforeInteractive` strategy are injected into the initial HTML from the server, downloaded before any Next.js module, and executed in the order they are placed before _any_ hydration occurs on the page.\n\nScripts denoted with this strategy are preloaded and fetched before any first-party code, but their execution does not block page hydration from occurring.\n\n`beforeInteractive` scripts must be placed inside the `Document` Component (`pages/_document.js`) and are designed to load scripts that are needed by the entire site (i.e. the script will load when any page in the application has been loaded server-side).\n\n**This strategy should only be used for critical scripts that need to be fetched before any part of the page becomes interactive.**\n\n```\nimport { Html, Head, Main, NextScript } from 'next/document'\nimport Script from 'next/script'\n \nexport default function Document() {\n  return (\n    <Html>\n      <Head />\n      <body>\n        <Main />\n        <NextScript />\n        <Script\n          src=\"https://example.com/script.js\"\n          strategy=\"beforeInteractive\"\n        />\n      </body>\n    </Html>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n> **Good to know**: Scripts with `beforeInteractive` will always be injected inside the `head` of the HTML document regardless of where it's placed in the component.\n\nSome examples of scripts that should be loaded as soon as possible with `beforeInteractive` include:\n\n*   Bot detectors\n*   Cookie consent managers\n\n### [`afterInteractive`](#afterinteractive)\n\nScripts that use the `afterInteractive` strategy are injected into the HTML client-side and will load after some (or all) hydration occurs on the page. **This is the default strategy** of the Script component and should be used for any script that needs to load as soon as possible but not before any first-party Next.js code.\n\n`afterInteractive` scripts can be placed inside of any page or layout and will only load and execute when that page (or group of pages) is opened in the browser.\n\n```\nimport Script from 'next/script'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Script src=\"https://example.com/script.js\" strategy=\"afterInteractive\" />\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nSome examples of scripts that are good candidates for `afterInteractive` include:\n\n*   Tag managers\n*   Analytics\n\n### [`lazyOnload`](#lazyonload)\n\nScripts that use the `lazyOnload` strategy are injected into the HTML client-side during browser idle time and will load after all resources on the page have been fetched. This strategy should be used for any background or low priority scripts that do not need to load early.\n\n`lazyOnload` scripts can be placed inside of any page or layout and will only load and execute when that page (or group of pages) is opened in the browser.\n\n```\nimport Script from 'next/script'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Script src=\"https://example.com/script.js\" strategy=\"lazyOnload\" />\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nExamples of scripts that do not need to load immediately and can be fetched with `lazyOnload` include:\n\n*   Chat support plugins\n*   Social media widgets\n\n### [`worker`](#worker)\n\n> **Warning:** The `worker` strategy is not yet stable and does not yet work with the [`app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/defining-routes) directory. Use with caution.\n\nScripts that use the `worker` strategy are off-loaded to a web worker in order to free up the main thread and ensure that only critical, first-party resources are processed on it. While this strategy can be used for any script, it is an advanced use case that is not guaranteed to support all third-party scripts.\n\nTo use `worker` as a strategy, the `nextScriptWorkers` flag must be enabled in `next.config.js`:\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  experimental: {\n    nextScriptWorkers: true,\n  },\n}\n```\n\n`worker` scripts can **only currently be used in the `pages/` directory**:\n\n```\nimport Script from 'next/script'\n \nexport default function Home() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Script src=\"https://example.com/script.js\" strategy=\"worker\" />\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n### [`onLoad`](#onload)\n\n> **Warning:** `onLoad` does not yet work with Server Components and can only be used in Client Components. Further, `onLoad` can't be used with `beforeInteractive` – consider using `onReady` instead.\n\nSome third-party scripts require users to run JavaScript code once after the script has finished loading in order to instantiate content or call a function. If you are loading a script with either afterInteractive or lazyOnload as a loading strategy, you can execute code after it has loaded using the onLoad property.\n\nHere's an example of executing a lodash method only after the library has been loaded.\n\n```\n'use client'\n \nimport Script from 'next/script'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Script\n        src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/lodash.js/4.17.20/lodash.min.js\"\n        onLoad={() => {\n          console.log(_.sample([1, 2, 3, 4]))\n        }}\n      />\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n### [`onReady`](#onready)\n\n> **Warning:** `onReady` does not yet work with Server Components and can only be used in Client Components.\n\nSome third-party scripts require users to run JavaScript code after the script has finished loading and every time the component is mounted (after a route navigation for example). You can execute code after the script's load event when it first loads and then after every subsequent component re-mount using the onReady property.\n\nHere's an example of how to re-instantiate a Google Maps JS embed every time the component is mounted:\n\n```\nimport { useRef } from 'react'\nimport Script from 'next/script'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  const mapRef = useRef()\n \n  return (\n    <>\n      <div ref={mapRef}></div>\n      <Script\n        id=\"google-maps\"\n        src=\"https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js\"\n        onReady={() => {\n          new google.maps.Map(mapRef.current, {\n            center: { lat: -34.397, lng: 150.644 },\n            zoom: 8,\n          })\n        }}\n      />\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n### [`onError`](#onerror)\n\n> **Warning:** `onError` does not yet work with Server Components and can only be used in Client Components. `onError` cannot be used with the `beforeInteractive` loading strategy.\n\nSometimes it is helpful to catch when a script fails to load. These errors can be handled with the onError property:\n\n```\nimport Script from 'next/script'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Script\n        src=\"https://example.com/script.js\"\n        onError={(e: Error) => {\n          console.error('Script failed to load', e)\n        }}\n      />\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n## [Version History](#version-history)\n\n| Version | Changes |\n| --- | --- |\n| `v13.0.0` | `beforeInteractive` and `afterInteractive` is modified to support `app`. |\n| `v12.2.4` | `onReady` prop added. |\n| `v12.2.2` | Allow `next/script` with `beforeInteractive` to be placed in `_document`. |\n| `v11.0.0` | `next/script` introduced. |",

Ensure the returned object from `getInitialProps` is a plain `Object`, and not using `Date`, `Map` or `Set`.\n> *   For the initial page load, `getInitialProps` will run on the server only. `getInitialProps` will then also run on the client when navigating to a different route with the [`next/link`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/components/link) component or by using [`next/router`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/use-router).\n> *   If `getInitialProps` is used in a custom `_app.js`, and the page being navigated to is using `getServerSideProps`, then `getInitialProps` will also run on the server.\n\n## [Context Object](#context-object)\n\n`getInitialProps` receives a single argument called `context`, which is an object with the following properties:\n\n| Name | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `pathname` | Current route, the path of the page in `/pages` |\n| `query` | Query string of the URL, parsed as an object |\n| `asPath` | `String` of the actual path (including the query) shown in the browser |\n| `req` | [HTTP request object](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_incomingmessage) (server only) |\n| `res` | [HTTP response object](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_serverresponse) (server only) |\n| `err` | Error object if any error is encountered during the rendering |\n\n## [Caveats](#caveats)\n\n*   `getInitialProps` can only be used in `pages/` top level files, and not in nested components. To have nested data fetching at the component level, consider exploring the [App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching).\n*   Regardless of whether your route is static or dynamic, any data returned from `getInitialProps` as `props` will be able to be examined on the client-side in the initial HTML. This is to allow the page to be [hydrated](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/hydrate) correctly. Make sure that you don't pass any sensitive information that shouldn't be available on the client in `props`.",

    "markdown": "# Upgrading: Codemods | Next.js\n\nCodemods are transformations that run on your codebase programmatically. This allows a large number of changes to be programmatically applied without having to manually go through every file.\n\nNext.js provides Codemod transformations to help upgrade your Next.js codebase when an API is updated or deprecated.\n\n## [Usage](#usage)\n\nIn your terminal, navigate (`cd`) into your project's folder, then run:\n\n```\nnpx @next/codemod <transform> <path>\n```\n\nReplacing `<transform>` and `<path>` with appropriate values.\n\n*   `transform` - name of transform\n*   `path` - files or directory to transform\n*   `--dry` Do a dry-run, no code will be edited\n*   `--print` Prints the changed output for comparison\n\n## [Next.js Codemods](#nextjs-codemods)\n\n### [14.0](#140)\n\n#### [Migrate `ImageResponse` imports](#migrate-imageresponse-imports)\n\n##### [`next-og-import`](#next-og-import)\n\n```\nnpx @next/codemod@latest next-og-import .\n```\n\nThis codemod moves transforms imports from `next/server` to `next/og` for usage of [Dynamic OG Image Generation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/metadata#dynamic-image-generation).\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nimport { ImageResponse } from 'next/server'\n```\n\nTransforms into:\n\n```\nimport { ImageResponse } from 'next/og'\n```\n\n#### [Use `viewport` export](#use-viewport-export)\n\n##### [`metadata-to-viewport-export`](#metadata-to-viewport-export)\n\n```\nnpx @next/codemod@latest metadata-to-viewport-export .\n```\n\nThis codemod migrates certain viewport metadata to `viewport` export.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nexport const metadata = {\n  title: 'My App',\n  themeColor: 'dark',\n  viewport: {\n    width: 1,\n  },\n}\n```\n\nTransforms into:\n\n```\nexport const metadata = {\n  title: 'My App',\n}\n \nexport const viewport = {\n  width: 1,\n  themeColor: 'dark',\n}\n```\n\n### [13.2](#132)\n\n#### [Use Built-in Font](#use-built-in-font)\n\n##### [`built-in-next-font`](#built-in-next-font)\n\n```\nnpx @next/codemod@latest built-in-next-font .\n```\n\nThis codemod uninstalls the `@next/font` package and transforms `@next/font` imports into the built-in `next/font`.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nimport { Inter } from '@next/font/google'\n```\n\nTransforms into:\n\n```\nimport { Inter } from 'next/font/google'\n```\n\n### [13.0](#130)\n\n#### [Rename Next Image Imports](#rename-next-image-imports)\n\n##### [`next-image-to-legacy-image`](#next-image-to-legacy-image)\n\n```\nnpx @next/codemod@latest next-image-to-legacy-image .\n```\n\nSafely renames `next/image` imports in existing Next.js 10, 11, or 12 applications to `next/legacy/image` in Next.js 13. Also renames `next/future/image` to `next/image`.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nimport Image1 from 'next/image'\nimport Image2 from 'next/future/image'\n \nexport default function Home() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <Image1 src=\"/test.jpg\" width=\"200\" height=\"300\" />\n      <Image2 src=\"/test.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"400\" />\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nTransforms into:\n\n```\n// 'next/image' becomes 'next/legacy/image'\nimport Image1 from 'next/legacy/image'\n// 'next/future/image' becomes 'next/image'\nimport Image2 from 'next/image'\n \nexport default function Home() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <Image1 src=\"/test.jpg\" width=\"200\" height=\"300\" />\n      <Image2 src=\"/test.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"400\" />\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n#### [Migrate to the New Image Component](#migrate-to-the-new-image-component)\n\n##### [`next-image-experimental`](#next-image-experimental)\n\n```\nnpx @next/codemod@latest next-image-experimental .\n```\n\nDangerously migrates from `next/legacy/image` to the new `next/image` by adding inline styles and removing unused props.\n\n*   Removes `layout` prop and adds `style`.\n*   Removes `objectFit` prop and adds `style`.\n*   Removes `objectPosition` prop and adds `style`.\n*   Removes `lazyBoundary` prop.\n*   Removes `lazyRoot` prop.\n\n#### [Remove `<a>` Tags From Link Components](#remove-a-tags-from-link-components)\n\n##### [`new-link`](#new-link)\n\n```\nnpx @next/codemod@latest new-link .\n```\n\nRemove `<a>` tags inside [Link Components](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/components/link), or add a `legacyBehavior` prop to Links that cannot be auto-fixed.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\n<Link href=\"/about\">\n  <a>About</a>\n</Link>\n// transforms into\n<Link href=\"/about\">\n  About\n</Link>\n \n<Link href=\"/about\">\n  <a onClick={() => console.log('clicked')}>About</a>\n</Link>\n// transforms into\n<Link href=\"/about\" onClick={() => console.log('clicked')}>\n  About\n</Link>\n```\n\nIn cases where auto-fixing can't be applied, the `legacyBehavior` prop is added. This allows your app to keep functioning using the old behavior for that particular link.\n\n```\nconst Component = () => <a>About</a>\n \n<Link href=\"/about\">\n  <Component />\n</Link>\n// becomes\n<Link href=\"/about\" legacyBehavior>\n  <Component />\n</Link>\n```\n\n### [11](#11)\n\n#### [Migrate from CRA](#migrate-from-cra)\n\n##### [`cra-to-next`](#cra-to-next)\n\n```\nnpx @next/codemod cra-to-next\n```\n\nMigrates a Create React App project to Next.js; creating a Pages Router and necessary config to match behavior. Client-side only rendering is leveraged initially to prevent breaking compatibility due to `window` usage during SSR and can be enabled seamlessly to allow the gradual adoption of Next.js specific features.\n\nPlease share any feedback related to this transform [in this discussion](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/25858).\n\n### [10](#10)\n\n#### [Add React imports](#add-react-imports)\n\n##### [`add-missing-react-import`](#add-missing-react-import)\n\n```\nnpx @next/codemod add-missing-react-import\n```\n\nTransforms files that do not import `React` to include the import in order for the new [React JSX transform](https://reactjs.org/blog/2020/09/22/introducing-the-new-jsx-transform.html) to work.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nexport default class Home extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return <div>Hello World</div>\n  }\n}\n```\n\nTransforms into:\n\n```\nimport React from 'react'\nexport default class Home extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return <div>Hello World</div>\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### [9](#9)\n\n#### [Transform Anonymous Components into Named Components](#transform-anonymous-components-into-named-components)\n\n##### [`name-default-component`](#name-default-component)\n\n```\nnpx @next/codemod name-default-component\n```\n\n**Versions 9 and above.**\n\nTransforms anonymous components into named components to make sure they work with [Fast Refresh](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-9-4#fast-refresh).\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nexport default function () {\n  return <div>Hello World</div>\n}\n```\n\nTransforms into:\n\n```\nexport default function MyComponent() {\n  return <div>Hello World</div>\n}\n```\n\nThe component will have a camel-cased name based on the name of the file, and it also works with arrow functions.\n\n### [8](#8)\n\n#### [Transform AMP HOC into page config](#transform-amp-hoc-into-page-config)\n\n##### [`withamp-to-config`](#withamp-to-config)\n\n```\nnpx @next/codemod withamp-to-config\n```\n\nTransforms the `withAmp` HOC into Next.js 9 page configuration.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\n// Before\nimport { withAmp } from 'next/amp'\n \nfunction Home() {\n  return <h1>My AMP Page</h1>\n}\n \nexport default withAmp(Home)\n```\n\n```\n// After\nexport default function Home() {\n  return <h1>My AMP Page</h1>\n}\n \nexport const config = {\n  amp: true,\n}\n```\n\n### [6](#6)\n\n#### [Use `withRouter`](#use-withrouter)\n\n##### [`url-to-withrouter`](#url-to-withrouter)\n\n```\nnpx @next/codemod url-to-withrouter\n```\n\nTransforms the deprecated automatically injected `url` property on top level pages to using `withRouter` and the `router` property it injects. Read more here: [https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/url-deprecated](https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/url-deprecated)\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nimport React from 'react'\nexport default class extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    const { pathname } = this.props.url\n    return <div>Current pathname: {pathname}</div>\n  }\n}\n```\n\n```\nimport React from 'react'\nimport { withRouter } from 'next/router'\nexport default withRouter(\n  class extends React.Component {\n    render() {\n      const { pathname } = this.props.router\n      return <div>Current pathname: {pathname}</div>\n    }\n  }\n)\n```\n\nThis is one case.

    "markdown": "# Components: <Link> | Next.js\n\nExamples\n\n*   [Hello World](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/hello-world)\n*   [Active className on Link](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/active-class-name)\n\n`<Link>` is a React component that extends the HTML `<a>` element to provide [prefetching](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/linking-and-navigating#2-prefetching) and client-side navigation between routes. It is the primary way to navigate between routes in Next.js.\n\nFor an example, consider a `pages` directory with the following files:\n\n*   `pages/index.js`\n*   `pages/about.js`\n*   `pages/blog/[slug].js`\n\nWe can have a link to each of these pages like so:\n\n```\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n \nfunction Home() {\n  return (\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        <Link href=\"/\">Home</Link>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <Link href=\"/about\">About Us</Link>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <Link href=\"/blog/hello-world\">Blog Post</Link>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n  )\n}\n \nexport default Home\n```\n\n## [Props](#props)\n\nHere's a summary of the props available for the Link Component:\n\n| Prop | Example | Type | Required |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| [`href`](#href-required) | `href=\"/dashboard\"` | String or Object | Yes |\n| [`replace`](#replace) | `replace={false}` | Boolean | \\-  |\n| [`scroll`](#scroll) | `scroll={false}` | Boolean | \\-  |\n| [`prefetch`](#prefetch) | `prefetch={false}` | Boolean | \\-  |\n\n> **Good to know**: `<a>` tag attributes such as `className` or `target=\"_blank\"` can be added to `<Link>` as props and will be passed to the underlying `<a>` element.\n\n### [`href` (required)](#href-required)\n\nThe path or URL to navigate to.\n\n```\n<Link href=\"/dashboard\">Dashboard</Link>\n```\n\n`href` can also accept an object, for example:\n\n```\n// Navigate to /about?name=test\n<Link\n  href={{\n    pathname: '/about',\n    query: { name: 'test' },\n  }}\n>\n  About\n</Link>\n```\n\n### [`replace`](#replace)\n\n**Defaults to `false`.** When `true`, `next/link` will replace the current history state instead of adding a new URL into the [browser’s history](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/History_API) stack.\n\n```\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <Link href=\"/dashboard\" replace>\n      Dashboard\n    </Link>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n### [`scroll`](#scroll)\n\n**Defaults to `true`.** The default behavior of `<Link>` **is to scroll to the top of a new route or to maintain the scroll position for backwards and forwards navigation.** When `false`, `next/link` will _not_ scroll to the top of the page after a navigation.\n\n```\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <Link href=\"/dashboard\" scroll={false}>\n      Dashboard\n    </Link>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n> **Good to know**:\n> \n> *   Next.js will scroll to the [Page](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts#pages) if it is not visible in the viewport upon navigation.\n\n### [`prefetch`](#prefetch)\n\nPrefetching happens when a `<Link />` component enters the user's viewport (initially or through scroll). Next.js prefetches and loads the linked route (denoted by the `href`) and data in the background to improve the performance of client-side navigations. Prefetching is only enabled in production.\n\n*   **`true` (default)**: The full route and its data will be prefetched.\n*   `false`: Prefetching will not happen when entering the viewport, but will happen on hover. If you want to completely remove fetching on hover as well, consider using an `<a>` tag or [incrementally adopting](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/upgrading/app-router-migration) the App Router, which enables disabling prefetching on hover too.\n\n```\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <Link href=\"/dashboard\" prefetch={false}>\n      Dashboard\n    </Link>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n## [Other Props](#other-props)\n\n### [`legacyBehavior`](#legacybehavior)\n\nAn `<a>` element is no longer required as a child of `<Link>`. Add the `legacyBehavior` prop to use the legacy behavior or remove the `<a>` to upgrade. A [codemod is available](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/upgrading/codemods#new-link) to automatically upgrade your code.\n\n> **Good to know**: when `legacyBehavior` is not set to `true`, all [`anchor`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a) tag properties can be passed to `next/link` as well such as, `className`, `onClick`, etc.\n\n### [`passHref`](#passhref)\n\nForces `Link` to send the `href` property to its child. Defaults to `false`\n\n### [`scroll`](#scroll-1)\n\nScroll to the top of the page after a navigation. Defaults to `true`\n\n### [`shallow`](#shallow)\n\nUpdate the path of the current page without rerunning [`getStaticProps`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-static-props), [`getServerSideProps`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-server-side-props) or [`getInitialProps`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/get-initial-props). Defaults to `false`\n\n### [`locale`](#locale)\n\nThe active locale is automatically prepended. `locale` allows for providing a different locale. When `false` `href` has to include the locale as the default behavior is disabled.\n\n## [Examples](#examples)\n\n### [Linking to Dynamic Routes](#linking-to-dynamic-routes)\n\nFor dynamic routes, it can be handy to use template literals to create the link's path.\n\nFor example, you can generate a list of links to the dynamic route `pages/blog/[slug].js`\n\n```\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n \nfunction Posts({ posts }) {\n  return (\n    <ul>\n      {posts.map((post) => (\n        <li key={post.id}>\n          <Link href={`/blog/${post.slug}`}>{post.title}</Link>\n        </li>\n      ))}\n    </ul>\n  )\n}\n \nexport default Posts\n```\n\n### [If the child is a custom component that wraps an `<a>` tag](#if-the-child-is-a-custom-component-that-wraps-an-a-tag)\n\nIf the child of `Link` is a custom component that wraps an `<a>` tag, you must add `passHref` to `Link`. This is necessary if you’re using libraries like [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/). Without this, the `<a>` tag will not have the `href` attribute, which hurts your site's accessibility and might affect SEO. If you're using [ESLint](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/eslint#eslint-plugin), there is a built-in rule `next/link-passhref` to ensure correct usage of `passHref`.\n\n```\nimport Link from 'next/link'\nimport styled from 'styled-components'\n \n// This creates a custom component that wraps an <a> tag\nconst RedLink = styled.a`\n  color: red;\n`\n \nfunction NavLink({ href, name }) {\n  return (\n    <Link href={href} passHref legacyBehavior>\n      <RedLink>{name}</RedLink>\n    </Link>\n  )\n}\n \nexport default NavLink\n```\n\n*   If you’re using [emotion](https://emotion.sh/)’s JSX pragma feature (`@jsx jsx`), you must use `passHref` even if you use an `<a>` tag directly.\n*   The component should support `onClick` property to trigger navigation correctly\n\n### [If the child is a functional component](#if-the-child-is-a-functional-component)\n\nIf the child of `Link` is a functional component, in addition to using `passHref` and `legacyBehavior`, you must wrap the component in [`React.forwardRef`](https://react.dev/reference/react/forwardRef):\n\n```\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n \n// `onClick`, `href`, and `ref` need to be passed to the DOM element\n// for proper handling\nconst MyButton = React.forwardRef(({ onClick, href }, ref) => {\n  return (\n    <a href={href} onClick={onClick} ref={ref}>\n      Click Me\n    </a>\n  )\n})\n \nfunction Home() {\n  return (\n    <Link href=\"/about\" passHref legacyBehavior>\n      <MyButton />\n    </Link>\n  )\n}\n \nexport default Home\n```\n\n### [With URL Object](#with-url-object)\n\n`Link` can also receive a URL object and it will automatically format it to create the URL string. Here's how to do it:\n\n```\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n \nfunction Home() {\n  return (\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        <Link\n          href={{\n            pathname: '/about',\n            query: { name: 'test' },\n          }}\n        >\n          About us\n        </Link>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <Link\n          href={{\n            pathname: '/blog/[slug]',\n            query: { slug: 'my-post' },\n          }}\n        >\n          Blog Post\n        </Link>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n  )\n}\n \nexport default Home\n```\n\nThe above example has a link to:\n\n*   A predefined route: `/about?name=test`\n*   A [dynamic route](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes): `/blog/my-post`\n\nYou can use every property as defined in the [Node.js URL module documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/url.html#url_url_strings_and_url_objects).\n\n### [Replace the URL instead of push](#replace-the-url-instead-of-push)\n\nThe default behavior of the `Link` component is to `push` a new URL into the `history` stack. You can use the `replace` prop to prevent adding a new entry, as in the following example:\n\n```\n<Link href=\"/about\" replace>\n  About us\n</Link>\n```\n\n### [Disable scrolling to the top of the page](#disable-scrolling-to-the-top-of-the-page)\n\nThe default behavior of `Link` is to scroll to the top of the page. When there is a hash defined it will scroll to the specific id, like a normal `<a>` tag. To prevent scrolling to the top / hash `scroll={false}` can be added to `Link`:\n\n```\n<Link href=\"/#hashid\" scroll={false}>\n  Disables scrolling to the top\n</Link>\n```\n\n### [Middleware](#middleware)\n\nIt's common to use [Middleware](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware) for authentication or other purposes that involve rewriting the user to a different page. In order for the `<Link />` component to properly prefetch links with rewrites via Middleware, you need to tell Next.js both the URL to display and the URL to prefetch. This is required to avoid un-necessary fetches to middleware to know the correct route to prefetch.\n\nFor example, if you want to serve a `/dashboard` route that has authenticated and visitor views, you may add something similar to the following in your Middleware to redirect the user to the correct page:\n\n```\nexport function middleware(req) {\n  const nextUrl = req.nextUrl\n  if (nextUrl.pathname === '/dashboard') {\n    if (req.cookies.authToken) {\n      return NextResponse.rewrite(new URL('/auth/dashboard', req.url))\n    } else {\n      return NextResponse.rewrite(new URL('/public/dashboard', req.url))\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this case, you would want to use the following code in your `<Link />` component:\n\n```\nimport Link from 'next/link'\nimport useIsAuthed from './hooks/useIsAuthed'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  const isAuthed = useIsAuthed()\n  const path = isAuthed ? '/auth/dashboard' : '/public/dashboard'\n  return (\n    <Link as=\"/dashboard\" href={path}>\n      Dashboard\n    </Link>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n> **Good to know**: If you're using [Dynamic Routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes), you'll need to adapt your `as` and `href` props. For example, if you have a Dynamic Route like `/dashboard/authed/[user]` that you want to present differently via middleware, you would write: `<Link href={{ pathname: '/dashboard/authed/[user]', query: { user: username } }} as=\"/dashboard/[user]\">Profile</Link>`.\n\n## [Version History](#version-history)\n\n| Version | Changes |\n| --- | --- |\n| `v13.0.0` | No longer requires a child `<a>` tag. A [codemod](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/upgrading/codemods#remove-a-tags-from-link-components) is provided to automatically update your codebase. |\n| `v10.0.0` | `href` props pointing to a dynamic route are automatically resolved and no longer require an `as` prop. |\n| `v8.0.0` | Improved prefetching performance. |\n| `v1.0.0` | `next/link` introduced. |",

    "markdown": "# Configuring: AMP | Next.js\n\nExamples\n\n*   [AMP](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/amp)\n\nWith Next.js you can turn any React page into an AMP page, with minimal config, and without leaving React.\n\nYou can read more about AMP in the official [amp.dev](https://amp.dev/) site.\n\n## [Enabling AMP](#enabling-amp)\n\nTo enable AMP support for a page, and to learn more about the different AMP configs, read the [API documentation for `next/amp`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/amp).\n\n## [Caveats](#caveats)\n\n*   Only CSS-in-JS is supported. [CSS Modules](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/styling) aren't supported by AMP pages at the moment. You can [contribute CSS Modules support to Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/10549).\n\n## [Adding AMP Components](#adding-amp-components)\n\nThe AMP community provides [many components](https://amp.dev/documentation/components/) to make AMP pages more interactive. Next.js will automatically import all components used on a page and there is no need to manually import AMP component scripts:\n\n```\nexport const config = { amp: true }\n \nfunction MyAmpPage() {\n  const date = new Date()\n \n  return (\n    <div>\n      <p>Some time: {date.toJSON()}</p>\n      <amp-timeago\n        width=\"0\"\n        height=\"15\"\n        datetime={date.toJSON()}\n        layout=\"responsive\"\n      >\n        .\n      </amp-timeago>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n \nexport default MyAmpPage\n```\n\nThe above example uses the [`amp-timeago`](https://amp.dev/documentation/components/amp-timeago/?format=websites) component.\n\nBy default, the latest version of a component is always imported. If you want to customize the version, you can use `next/head`, as in the following example:\n\n```\nimport Head from 'next/head'\n \nexport const config = { amp: true }\n \nfunction MyAmpPage() {\n  const date = new Date()\n \n  return (\n    <div>\n      <Head>\n        <script\n          async\n          key=\"amp-timeago\"\n          custom-element=\"amp-timeago\"\n          src=\"https://cdn.ampproject.org/v0/amp-timeago-0.1.js\"\n        />\n      </Head>\n \n      <p>Some time: {date.toJSON()}</p>\n      <amp-timeago\n        width=\"0\"\n        height=\"15\"\n        datetime={date.toJSON()}\n        layout=\"responsive\"\n      >\n        .\n      </amp-timeago>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n \nexport default MyAmpPage\n```\n\n## [AMP Validation](#amp-validation)\n\nAMP pages are automatically validated with [amphtml-validator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/amphtml-validator) during development. Errors and warnings will appear in the terminal where you started Next.js.\n\nPages are also validated during [Static HTML export](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/deploying/static-exports) and any warnings / errors will be printed to the terminal. Any AMP errors will cause the export to exit with status code `1` because the export is not valid AMP.\n\n### [Custom Validators](#custom-validators)\n\nYou can set up custom AMP validator in `next.config.js` as shown below:\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  amp: {\n    validator: './custom_validator.js',\n  },\n}\n```\n\n### [Skip AMP Validation](#skip-amp-validation)\n\nTo turn off AMP validation add the following code to `next.config.js`\n\n```\nexperimental: {\n  amp: {\n    skipValidation: true\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### [AMP in Static HTML Export](#amp-in-static-html-export)\n\nWhen using [Static HTML export](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/deploying/static-exports) statically prerender pages, Next.js will detect if the page supports AMP and change the exporting behavior based on that.\n\nFor example, the hybrid AMP page `pages/about.js` would output:\n\n*   `out/about.html` - HTML page with client-side React runtime\n*   `out/about.amp.html` - AMP page\n\nAnd if `pages/about.js` is an AMP-only page, then it would output:\n\n*   `out/about.html` - Optimized AMP page\n\nNext.js will automatically insert a link to the AMP version of your page in the HTML version, so you don't have to, like so:\n\n```\n<link rel=\"amphtml\" href=\"/about.amp.html\" />\n```\n\nAnd the AMP version of your page will include a link to the HTML page:\n\n```\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"/about\" />\n```\n\nWhen [`trailingSlash`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/next-config-js/trailingSlash) is enabled the exported pages for `pages/about.js` would be:\n\n*   `out/about/index.html` - HTML page\n*   `out/about.amp/index.html` - AMP page\n\n## [TypeScript](#typescript)\n\nAMP currently doesn't have built-in types for TypeScript, but it's in their roadmap ([#13791](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/issues/13791)).\n\nAs a workaround you can manually create a file called `amp.d.ts` inside your project and add these [custom types](https://stackoverflow.com/a/50601125).",

    "markdown": "# Configuring: MDX | Next.js\n\n## Markdown and MDX\n\n[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) is a lightweight markup language used to format text. It allows you to write using plain text syntax and convert it to structurally valid HTML. It's commonly used for writing content on websites and blogs.\n\nYou write...\n\n```\nI **love** using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```\n<p>I <strong>love</strong> using <a href=\"https://nextjs.org/\">Next.js</a></p>\n```\n\n[MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) is a superset of markdown that lets you write [JSX](https://react.dev/learn/writing-markup-with-jsx) directly in your markdown files. It is a powerful way to add dynamic interactivity and embed React components within your content.\n\nNext.js can support both local MDX content inside your application, as well as remote MDX files fetched dynamically on the server. The Next.js plugin handles transforming markdown and React components into HTML, including support for usage in Server Components (the default in App Router).\n\nThe `@next/mdx` package is used to configure Next.js so it can process markdown and MDX. **It sources data from local files**, allowing you to create pages with a `.mdx` extension, directly in your `/pages` or `/app` directory.\n\nLet's walk through how to configure and use MDX with Next.js.\n\n## [Getting Started](#getting-started)\n\nInstall packages needed to render MDX:\n\n```\nnpm install @next/mdx @mdx-js/loader @mdx-js/react @types/mdx\n```\n\nUpdate the `next.config.js` file at your project's root to configure it to use MDX:\n\n```\nconst withMDX = require('@next/mdx')()\n \n/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */\nconst nextConfig = {\n  // Configure `pageExtensions` to include MDX files\n  pageExtensions: ['js', 'jsx', 'mdx', 'ts', 'tsx'],\n  // Optionally, add any other Next.js config below\n}\n \nmodule.exports = withMDX(nextConfig)\n```\n\nThen, create a new MDX page within the `/pages` directory:\n\n```\n  your-project\n  ├── pages\n  │   └── my-mdx-page.mdx\n  └── package.json\n```\n\nNow you can use markdown and import React components directly inside your MDX page:\n\n```\nimport { MyComponent } from 'my-components'\n \n# Welcome to my MDX page!\n \nThis is some **bold** and _italics_ text.\n \nThis is a list in markdown:\n \n- One\n- Two\n- Three\n \nCheckout my React component:\n \n<MyComponent />\n```\n\nNavigating to the `/my-mdx-page` route should display your rendered MDX.\n\n## [Remote MDX](#remote-mdx)\n\nIf your markdown or MDX files or content lives _somewhere else_, you can fetch it dynamically on the server. This is useful for content stored in a separate local folder, CMS, database, or anywhere else. A popular community package for this use is [`next-mdx-remote`](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote#react-server-components-rsc--nextjs-app-directory-support).\n\n> **Good to know**: Please proceed with caution. MDX compiles to JavaScript and is executed on the server. You should only fetch MDX content from a trusted source, otherwise this can lead to remote code execution (RCE).\n\nThe following example uses `next-mdx-remote`:\n\n```\nimport { serialize } from 'next-mdx-remote/serialize'\nimport { MDXRemote, MDXRemoteSerializeResult } from 'next-mdx-remote'\n \ninterface Props {\n  mdxSource: MDXRemoteSerializeResult\n}\n \nexport default function RemoteMdxPage({ mdxSource }: Props) {\n  return <MDXRemote {...mdxSource} />\n}\n \nexport async function getStaticProps() {\n  // MDX text - can be from a local file, database, CMS, fetch, anywhere...\n  const res = await fetch('https:...')\n  const mdxText = await res.text()\n  const mdxSource = await serialize(mdxText)\n  return { props: { mdxSource } }\n}\n```\n\nNavigating to the `/my-mdx-page-remote` route should display your rendered MDX.\n\n## [Layouts](#layouts)\n\nTo share a layout around MDX pages, create a layout component:\n\n```\nexport default function MdxLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {\n  // Create any shared layout or styles here\n  return <div style={{ color: 'blue' }}>{children}</div>\n}\n```\n\nThen, import the layout component into the MDX page, wrap the MDX content in the layout, and export it:\n\n```\nimport MdxLayout from '../components/mdx-layout'\n \n# Welcome to my MDX page!\n \nexport default function MDXPage({ children }) {\n  return <MdxLayout>{children}</MdxLayout>\n \n}\n```\n\n## [Remark and Rehype Plugins](#remark-and-rehype-plugins)\n\nYou can optionally provide `remark` and `rehype` plugins to transform the MDX content.\n\nFor example, you can use `remark-gfm` to support GitHub Flavored Markdown.\n\nSince the `remark` and `rehype` ecosystem is ESM only, you'll need to use `next.config.mjs` as the configuration file.\n\n```\nimport remarkGfm from 'remark-gfm'\nimport createMDX from '@next/mdx'\n \n/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */\nconst nextConfig = {\n  // Configure `pageExtensions`` to include MDX files\n  pageExtensions: ['js', 'jsx', 'mdx', 'ts', 'tsx'],\n  // Optionally, add any other Next.js config below\n}\n \nconst withMDX = createMDX({\n  // Add markdown plugins here, as desired\n  options: {\n    remarkPlugins: [remarkGfm],\n    rehypePlugins: [],\n  },\n})\n \n// Wrap MDX and Next.js config with each other\nexport default withMDX(nextConfig)\n```\n\n## [Frontmatter](#frontmatter)\n\nFrontmatter is a YAML like key/value pairing that can be used to store data about a page. `@next/mdx` does **not** support frontmatter by default, though there are many solutions for adding frontmatter to your MDX content, such as:\n\n*   [remark-frontmatter](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-frontmatter)\n*   [remark-mdx-frontmatter](https://github.com/remcohaszing/remark-mdx-frontmatter)\n*   [gray-matter](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/gray-matter).\n\nTo access page metadata with `@next/mdx`, you can export a metadata object from within the `.mdx` file:\n\n```\nexport const metadata = {\n  author: 'John Doe',\n}\n \n# My MDX page\n```\n\n## [Custom Elements](#custom-elements)\n\nOne of the pleasant aspects of using markdown, is that it maps to native `HTML` elements, making writing fast, and intuitive:\n\n```\nThis is a list in markdown:\n \n- One\n- Two\n- Three\n```\n\nThe above generates the following `HTML`:\n\n```\n<p>This is a list in markdown:</p>\n \n<ul>\n  <li>One</li>\n  <li>Two</li>\n  <li>Three</li>\n</ul>\n```\n\nWhen you want to style your own elements for a custom feel to your website or application, you can pass in shortcodes. These are your own custom components that map to `HTML` elements.\n\nTo do this, create a `mdx-components.tsx` file at the root of your application (the parent folder of `pages/` or `src/`) and add custom elements:\n\n```\nimport type { MDXComponents } from 'mdx/types'\nimport Image, { ImageProps } from 'next/image'\n \n// This file allows you to provide custom React components\n// to be used in MDX files. You can import and use any\n// React component you want, including inline styles,\n// components from other libraries, and more.\n \nexport function useMDXComponents(components: MDXComponents): MDXComponents {\n  return {\n    // Allows customizing built-in components, e.g. to add styling.\n    h1: ({ children }) => <h1 style={{ fontSize: '100px' }}>{children}</h1>,\n    img: (props) => (\n      <Image\n        sizes=\"100vw\"\n        style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }}\n        {...(props as ImageProps)}\n      />\n    ),\n    ...components,\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## [Deep Dive: How do you transform markdown into HTML?](#deep-dive-how-do-you-transform-markdown-into-html)\n\nReact does not natively understand markdown. The markdown plaintext needs to first be transformed into HTML. This can be accomplished with `remark` and `rehype`.\n\n`remark` is an ecosystem of tools around markdown. `rehype` is the same, but for HTML. For example, the following code snippet transforms markdown into HTML:\n\n```\nimport { unified } from 'unified'\nimport remarkParse from 'remark-parse'\nimport remarkRehype from 'remark-rehype'\nimport rehypeSanitize from 'rehype-sanitize'\nimport rehypeStringify from 'rehype-stringify'\n \nmain()\n \nasync function main() {\n  const file = await unified()\n    .use(remarkParse) // Convert into markdown AST\n    .use(remarkRehype) // Transform to HTML AST\n    .use(rehypeSanitize) // Sanitize HTML input\n    .use(rehypeStringify) // Convert AST into serialized HTML\n    .process('Hello, Next.js!')\n \n  console.log(String(file)) // <p>Hello, Next.js!</p>\n}\n```\n\nThe `remark` and `rehype` ecosystem contains plugins for [syntax highlighting](https://github.com/atomiks/rehype-pretty-code), [linking headings](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-autolink-headings), [generating a table of contents](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-toc), and more.\n\nWhen using `@next/mdx` as shown above, you **do not** need to use `remark` or `rehype` directly, as it is handled for you. We're describing it here for a deeper understanding of what the `@next/mdx` package is doing underneath.\n\n## [Using the Rust-based MDX compiler (Experimental)](#using-the-rust-based-mdx-compiler-experimental)\n\nNext.js supports a new MDX compiler written in Rust. This compiler is still experimental and is not recommended for production use. To use the new compiler, you need to configure `next.config.js` when you pass it to `withMDX`:\n\n```\nmodule.exports = withMDX({\n  experimental: {\n    mdxRs: true,\n  },\n})\n```\n\n## [Helpful Links](#helpful-links)\n\n*   [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/)\n*   [`@next/mdx`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@next/mdx)\n*   [remark](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark)\n*   [rehype](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype)\n*   [Markdoc](https://markdoc.dev/docs/nextjs)",

    "markdown": "# Components: <Image> (Legacy) | Next.js\n\nExamples\n\n*   [Legacy Image Component](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/image-legacy-component)\n\nStarting with Next.js 13, the `next/image` component was rewritten to improve both the performance and developer experience. In order to provide a backwards compatible upgrade solution, the old `next/image` was renamed to `next/legacy/image`.\n\nView the **new** [`next/image` API Reference](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/components/image)\n\n## [Comparison](#comparison)\n\nCompared to `next/legacy/image`, the new `next/image` component has the following changes:\n\n*   Removes `<span>` wrapper around `<img>` in favor of [native computed aspect ratio](https://caniuse.com/mdn-html_elements_img_aspect_ratio_computed_from_attributes)\n*   Adds support for canonical `style` prop\n    *   Removes `layout` prop in favor of `style` or `className`\n    *   Removes `objectFit` prop in favor of `style` or `className`\n    *   Removes `objectPosition` prop in favor of `style` or `className`\n*   Removes `IntersectionObserver` implementation in favor of [native lazy loading](https://caniuse.com/loading-lazy-attr)\n    *   Removes `lazyBoundary` prop since there is no native equivalent\n    *   Removes `lazyRoot` prop since there is no native equivalent\n*   Removes `loader` config in favor of [`loader`](#loader) prop\n*   Changed `alt` prop from optional to required\n*   Changed `onLoadingComplete` callback to receive reference to `<img>` element\n\n## [Required Props](#required-props)\n\nThe `<Image />` component requires the following properties.\n\n### [src](#src)\n\nMust be one of the following:\n\n*   A [statically imported](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/images#local-images) image file\n*   A path string. This can be either an absolute external URL, or an internal path depending on the [loader](#loader) prop or [loader configuration](#loader-configuration).\n\nWhen using an external URL, you must add it to [remotePatterns](#remote-patterns) in `next.config.js`.\n\n### [width](#width)\n\nThe `width` property can represent either the _rendered_ width or _original_ width in pixels, depending on the [`layout`](#layout) and [`sizes`](#sizes) properties.\n\nWhen using `layout=\"intrinsic\"` or `layout=\"fixed\"` the `width` property represents the _rendered_ width in pixels, so it will affect how large the image appears.\n\nWhen using `layout=\"responsive\"`, `layout=\"fill\"`, the `width` property represents the _original_ width in pixels, so it will only affect the aspect ratio.\n\nThe `width` property is required, except for [statically imported images](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/images#local-images), or those with `layout=\"fill\"`.\n\n### [height](#height)\n\nThe `height` property can represent either the _rendered_ height or _original_ height in pixels, depending on the [`layout`](#layout) and [`sizes`](#sizes) properties.\n\nWhen using `layout=\"intrinsic\"` or `layout=\"fixed\"` the `height` property represents the _rendered_ height in pixels, so it will affect how large the image appears.\n\nWhen using `layout=\"responsive\"`, `layout=\"fill\"`, the `height` property represents the _original_ height in pixels, so it will only affect the aspect ratio.\n\nThe `height` property is required, except for [statically imported images](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/images#local-images), or those with `layout=\"fill\"`.\n\n## [Optional Props](#optional-props)\n\nThe `<Image />` component accepts a number of additional properties beyond those which are required. This section describes the most commonly-used properties of the Image component. Find details about more rarely-used properties in the [Advanced Props](#advanced-props) section.\n\n### [layout](#layout)\n\nThe layout behavior of the image as the viewport changes size.\n\n| `layout` | Behavior | `srcSet` | `sizes` | Has wrapper and sizer |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `intrinsic` (default) | Scale _down_ to fit width of container, up to image size | `1x`, `2x` (based on [imageSizes](#image-sizes)) | N/A | yes |\n| `fixed` | Sized to `width` and `height` exactly | `1x`, `2x` (based on [imageSizes](#image-sizes)) | N/A | yes |\n| `responsive` | Scale to fit width of container | `640w`, `750w`, ... `2048w`, `3840w` (based on [imageSizes](#image-sizes) and [deviceSizes](#device-sizes)) | `100vw` | yes |\n| `fill` | Grow in both X and Y axes to fill container | `640w`, `750w`, ... `2048w`, `3840w` (based on [imageSizes](#image-sizes) and [deviceSizes](#device-sizes)) | `100vw` | yes |\n\n*   [Demo the `intrinsic` layout (default)](https://image-legacy-component.nextjs.gallery/layout-intrinsic)\n    *   When `intrinsic`, the image will scale the dimensions down for smaller viewports, but maintain the original dimensions for larger viewports.\n*   [Demo the `fixed` layout](https://image-legacy-component.nextjs.gallery/layout-fixed)\n    *   When `fixed`, the image dimensions will not change as the viewport changes (no responsiveness) similar to the native `img` element.\n*   [Demo the `responsive` layout](https://image-legacy-component.nextjs.gallery/layout-responsive)\n    *   When `responsive`, the image will scale the dimensions down for smaller viewports and scale up for larger viewports.\n    *   Ensure the parent element uses `display: block` in their stylesheet.\n*   [Demo the `fill` layout](https://image-legacy-component.nextjs.gallery/layout-fill)\n    *   When `fill`, the image will stretch both width and height to the dimensions of the parent element, provided the parent element is relative.\n    *   This is usually paired with the [`objectFit`](#objectfit) property.\n    *   Ensure the parent element has `position: relative` in their stylesheet.\n*   [Demo background image](https://image-legacy-component.nextjs.gallery/background)\n\n### [loader](#loader)\n\nA custom function used to resolve URLs. Setting the loader as a prop on the Image component overrides the default loader defined in the [`images` section of `next.config.js`](#loader-configuration).\n\nA `loader` is a function returning a URL string for the image, given the following parameters:\n\n*   [`src`](#src)\n*   [`width`](#width)\n*   [`quality`](#quality)\n\nHere is an example of using a custom loader:\n\n```\nimport Image from 'next/legacy/image'\n \nconst myLoader = ({ src, width, quality }) => {\n  return `https://example.com/${src}?w=${width}&q=${quality || 75}`\n}\n \nconst MyImage = (props) => {\n  return (\n    <Image\n      loader={myLoader}\n      src=\"me.png\"\n      alt=\"Picture of the author\"\n      width={500}\n      height={500}\n    />\n  )\n}\n```\n\n### [sizes](#sizes)\n\nA string that provides information about how wide the image will be at different breakpoints. The value of `sizes` will greatly affect performance for images using `layout=\"responsive\"` or `layout=\"fill\"`. It will be ignored for images using `layout=\"intrinsic\"` or `layout=\"fixed\"`.\n\nThe `sizes` property serves two important purposes related to image performance:\n\nFirst, the value of `sizes` is used by the browser to determine which size of the image to download, from `next/legacy/image`'s automatically-generated source set. When the browser chooses, it does not yet know the size of the image on the page, so it selects an image that is the same size or larger than the viewport. The `sizes` property allows you to tell the browser that the image will actually be smaller than full screen. If you don't specify a `sizes` value, a default value of `100vw` (full screen width) is used.\n\nSecond, the `sizes` value is parsed and used to trim the values in the automatically-created source set. If the `sizes` property includes sizes such as `50vw`, which represent a percentage of the viewport width, then the source set is trimmed to not include any values which are too small to ever be necessary.\n\nFor example, if you know your styling will cause an image to be full-width on mobile devices, in a 2-column layout on tablets, and a 3-column layout on desktop displays, you should include a sizes property such as the following:\n\n```\nimport Image from 'next/legacy/image'\nconst Example = () => (\n  <div className=\"grid-element\">\n    <Image\n      src=\"/example.png\"\n      layout=\"fill\"\n      sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw,\n              (max-width: 1200px) 50vw,\n              33vw\"\n    />\n  </div>\n)\n```\n\nThis example `sizes` could have a dramatic effect on performance metrics. Without the `33vw` sizes, the image selected from the server would be 3 times as wide as it needs to be. Because file size is proportional to the square of the width, without `sizes` the user would download an image that's 9 times larger than necessary.\n\nLearn more about `srcset` and `sizes`:\n\n*   [web.dev](https://web.dev/learn/design/responsive-images/#sizes)\n*   [mdn](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img#attr-sizes)\n\n### [quality](#quality)\n\nThe quality of the optimized image, an integer between `1` and `100` where `100` is the best quality. Defaults to `75`.\n\n### [priority](#priority)\n\nWhen true, the image will be considered high priority and [preload](https://web.dev/preload-responsive-images/). Lazy loading is automatically disabled for images using `priority`.\n\nYou should use the `priority` property on any image detected as the [Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)](https://nextjs.org/learn/seo/web-performance/lcp) element. It may be appropriate to have multiple priority images, as different images may be the LCP element for different viewport sizes.\n\nShould only be used when the image is visible above the fold. Defaults to `false`.\n\n### [placeholder](#placeholder)\n\nA placeholder to use while the image is loading. Possible values are `blur` or `empty`. Defaults to `empty`.\n\nWhen `blur`, the [`blurDataURL`](#blurdataurl) property will be used as the placeholder. If `src` is an object from a [static import](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/images#local-images) and the imported image is `.jpg`, `.png`, `.webp`, or `.avif`, then `blurDataURL` will be automatically populated.\n\nFor dynamic images, you must provide the [`blurDataURL`](#blurdataurl) property. Solutions such as [Plaiceholder](https://github.com/joe-bell/plaiceholder) can help with `base64` generation.\n\nWhen `empty`, there will be no placeholder while the image is loading, only empty space.\n\nTry it out:\n\n*   [Demo the `blur` placeholder](https://image-legacy-component.nextjs.gallery/placeholder)\n*   [Demo the shimmer effect with `blurDataURL` prop](https://image-legacy-component.nextjs.gallery/shimmer)\n*   [Demo the color effect with `blurDataURL` prop](https://image-legacy-component.nextjs.gallery/color)\n\n## [Advanced Props](#advanced-props)\n\nIn some cases, you may need more advanced usage. The `<Image />` component optionally accepts the following advanced properties.\n\n### [style](#style)\n\nAllows [passing CSS styles](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/style) to the underlying image element.\n\nNote that all `layout` modes apply their own styles to the image element, and these automatic styles take precedence over the `style` prop.\n\nAlso keep in mind that the required `width` and `height` props can interact with your styling. If you use styling to modify an image's `width`, you must set the `height=\"auto\"` style as well, or your image will be distorted.\n\n### [objectFit](#objectfit)\n\nDefines how the image will fit into its parent container when using `layout=\"fill\"`.\n\nThis value is passed to the [object-fit CSS property](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/object-fit) for the `src` image.\n\n### [objectPosition](#objectposition)\n\nDefines how the image is positioned within its parent element when using `layout=\"fill\"`.\n\nThis value is passed to the [object-position CSS property](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/object-position) applied to the image.\n\n### [onLoadingComplete](#onloadingcomplete)\n\nA callback function that is invoked once the image is completely loaded and the [placeholder](#placeholder) has been removed.\n\nThe `onLoadingComplete` function accepts one parameter, an object with the following properties:\n\n*   [`naturalWidth`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/HTMLImageElement/naturalWidth)\n*   [`naturalHeight`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/HTMLImageElement/naturalHeight)\n\n### [loading](#loading)\n\n> **Attention**: This property is only meant for advanced usage. Switching an image to load with `eager` will normally **hurt performance**.\n> \n> We recommend using the [`priority`](#priority) property instead, which properly loads the image eagerly for nearly all use cases.\n\nThe loading behavior of the image. Defaults to `lazy`.\n\nWhen `lazy`, defer loading the image until it reaches a calculated distance from the viewport.\n\nWhen `eager`, load the image immediately.\n\n[Learn more](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img#attr-loading)\n\n### [blurDataURL](#blurdataurl)\n\nA [Data URL](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/Data_URIs) to be used as a placeholder image before the `src` image successfully loads. Only takes effect when combined with [`placeholder=\"blur\"`](#placeholder).\n\nMust be a base64-encoded image. It will be enlarged and blurred, so a very small image (10px or less) is recommended. Including larger images as placeholders may harm your application performance.\n\nTry it out:\n\n*   [Demo the default `blurDataURL` prop](https://image-legacy-component.nextjs.gallery/placeholder)\n*   [Demo the shimmer effect with `blurDataURL` prop](https://image-legacy-component.nextjs.gallery/shimmer)\n*   [Demo the color effect with `blurDataURL` prop](https://image-legacy-component.nextjs.gallery/color)\n\nYou can also [generate a solid color Data URL](https://png-pixel.com/) to match the image.\n\n### [lazyBoundary](#lazyboundary)\n\nA string (with similar syntax to the margin property) that acts as the bounding box used to detect the intersection of the viewport with the image and trigger lazy [loading](#loading). Defaults to `\"200px\"`.\n\nIf the image is nested in a scrollable parent element other than the root document, you will also need to assign the [lazyRoot](#lazyroot) prop.\n\n[Learn more](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/IntersectionObserver/rootMargin)\n\n### [lazyRoot](#lazyroot)\n\nA React [Ref](https://react.dev/learn/referencing-values-with-refs) pointing to the scrollable parent element. Defaults to `null` (the document viewport).\n\nThe Ref must point to a DOM element or a React component that [forwards the Ref](https://react.dev/reference/react/forwardRef) to the underlying DOM element.\n\n**Example pointing to a DOM element**\n\n```\nimport Image from 'next/legacy/image'\nimport React from 'react'\n \nconst Example = () => {\n  const lazyRoot = React.useRef(null)\n \n  return (\n    <div ref={lazyRoot} style={{ overflowX: 'scroll', width: '500px' }}>\n      <Image lazyRoot={lazyRoot} src=\"/one.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" />\n      <Image lazyRoot={lazyRoot} src=\"/two.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" />\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n**Example pointing to a React component**\n\n```\nimport Image from 'next/legacy/image'\nimport React from 'react'\n \nconst Container = React.forwardRef((props, ref) => {\n  return (\n    <div ref={ref} style={{ overflowX: 'scroll', width: '500px' }}>\n      {props.children}\n    </div>\n  )\n})\n \nconst Example = () => {\n  const lazyRoot = React.useRef(null)\n \n  return (\n    <Container ref={lazyRoot}>\n      <Image lazyRoot={lazyRoot} src=\"/one.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" />\n      <Image lazyRoot={lazyRoot} src=\"/two.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" />\n    </Container>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n[Learn more](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/IntersectionObserver/root)\n\n### [unoptimized](#unoptimized)\n\nWhen true, the source image will be served as-is instead of changing quality, size, or format. Defaults to `false`.\n\n```\nimport Image from 'next/image'\n \nconst UnoptimizedImage = (props) => {\n  return <Image {...props} unoptimized />\n}\n```\n\nSince Next.js 12.3.0, this prop can be assigned to all images by updating `next.config.js` with the following configuration:\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    unoptimized: true,\n  },\n}\n```\n\n## [Other Props](#other-props)\n\nOther properties on the `<Image />` component will be passed to the underlying `img` element with the exception of the following:\n\n*   `srcSet`. Use [Device Sizes](#device-sizes) instead.\n*   `ref`. Use [`onLoadingComplete`](#onloadingcomplete) instead.\n*   `decoding`. It is always `\"async\"`.\n\n## [Configuration Options](#configuration-options)\n\n### [Remote Patterns](#remote-patterns)\n\nTo protect your application from malicious users, configuration is required in order to use external images. This ensures that only external images from your account can be served from the Next.js Image Optimization API. These external images can be configured with the `remotePatterns` property in your `next.config.js` file, as shown below:\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    remotePatterns: [\n      {\n        protocol: 'https',\n        hostname: 'example.com',\n        port: '',\n        pathname: '/account123/**',\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n}\n```\n\n> **Good to know**: The example above will ensure the `src` property of `next/legacy/image` must start with `https://example.com/account123/`. Any other protocol, hostname, port, or unmatched path will respond with 400 Bad Request.\n\nBelow is another example of the `remotePatterns` property in the `next.config.js` file:\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    remotePatterns: [\n      {\n        protocol: 'https',\n        hostname: '**.example.com',\n        port: '',\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n}\n```\n\n> **Good to know**: The example above will ensure the `src` property of `next/legacy/image` must start with `https://img1.example.com` or `https://me.avatar.example.com` or any number of subdomains. Any other protocol, port, or unmatched hostname will respond with 400 Bad Request.\n\nWildcard patterns can be used for both `pathname` and `hostname` and have the following syntax:\n\n*   `*` match a single path segment or subdomain\n*   `**` match any number of path segments at the end or subdomains at the beginning\n\nThe `**` syntax does not work in the middle of the pattern.\n\n> **Good to know**: When omitting `protocol`, `port` or `pathname`, then the wildcard `**` is implied. This is not recommended because it may allow malicious actors to optimize urls you did not intend.\n\n### [Domains](#domains)\n\n> **Warning**: Deprecated since Next.js 14 in favor of strict [`remotePatterns`](#remote-patterns) in order to protect your application from malicious users. Only use `domains` if you own all the content served from the domain.\n\nSimilar to [`remotePatterns`](#remote-patterns), the `domains` configuration can be used to provide a list of allowed hostnames for external images.\n\nHowever, the `domains` configuration does not support wildcard pattern matching and it cannot restrict protocol, port, or pathname.\n\nBelow is an example of the `domains` property in the `next.config.js` file:\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    domains: ['assets.acme.com'],\n  },\n}\n```\n\n### [Loader Configuration](#loader-configuration)\n\nIf you want to use a cloud provider to optimize images instead of using the Next.js built-in Image Optimization API, you can configure the `loader` and `path` prefix in your `next.config.js` file. This allows you to use relative URLs for the Image [`src`](#src) and automatically generate the correct absolute URL for your provider.\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    loader: 'imgix',\n    path: 'https://example.com/myaccount/',\n  },\n}\n```\n\n### [Built-in Loaders](#built-in-loaders)\n\nThe following Image Optimization cloud providers are included:\n\n*   Default: Works automatically with `next dev`, `next start`, or a custom server\n*   [Vercel](https://vercel.com/): Works automatically when you deploy on Vercel, no configuration necessary. [Learn more](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/image-optimization?utm_source=next-site&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=next-website)\n*   [Imgix](https://www.imgix.com/): `loader: 'imgix'`\n*   [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/): `loader: 'cloudinary'`\n*   [Akamai](https://www.akamai.com/): `loader: 'akamai'`\n*   Custom: `loader: 'custom'` use a custom cloud provider by implementing the [`loader`](#loader) prop on the `next/legacy/image` component\n\nIf you need a different provider, you can use the [`loader`](#loader) prop with `next/legacy/image`.\n\n> Images can not be optimized at build time using [`output: 'export'`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/deploying/static-exports), only on-demand. To use `next/legacy/image` with `output: 'export'`, you will need to use a different loader than the default. [Read more in the discussion.](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/19065)\n\n> The `next/legacy/image` component's default loader uses [`squoosh`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@squoosh/lib) because it is quick to install and suitable for a development environment. When using `next start` in your production environment, it is strongly recommended that you install [`sharp`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sharp) by running `npm i sharp` in your project directory. This is not necessary for Vercel deployments, as `sharp` is installed automatically.\n\n## [Advanced](#advanced)\n\nThe following configuration is for advanced use cases and is usually not necessary. If you choose to configure the properties below, you will override any changes to the Next.js defaults in future updates.\n\n### [Device Sizes](#device-sizes)\n\nIf you know the expected device widths of your users, you can specify a list of device width breakpoints using the `deviceSizes` property in `next.config.js`. These widths are used when the `next/legacy/image` component uses `layout=\"responsive\"` or `layout=\"fill\"` to ensure the correct image is served for user's device.\n\nIf no configuration is provided, the default below is used.\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    deviceSizes: [640, 750, 828, 1080, 1200, 1920, 2048, 3840],\n  },\n}\n```\n\n### [Image Sizes](#image-sizes)\n\nYou can specify a list of image widths using the `images.imageSizes` property in your `next.config.js` file. These widths are concatenated with the array of [device sizes](#device-sizes) to form the full array of sizes used to generate image [srcset](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/HTMLImageElement/srcset)s.\n\nThe reason there are two separate lists is that imageSizes is only used for images which provide a [`sizes`](#sizes) prop, which indicates that the image is less than the full width of the screen. **Therefore, the sizes in imageSizes should all be smaller than the smallest size in deviceSizes.**\n\nIf no configuration is provided, the default below is used.\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    imageSizes: [16, 32, 48, 64, 96, 128, 256, 384],\n  },\n}\n```\n\n### [Acceptable Formats](#acceptable-formats)\n\nThe default [Image Optimization API](#loader-configuration) will automatically detect the browser's supported image formats via the request's `Accept` header.\n\nIf the `Accept` head matches more than one of the configured formats, the first match in the array is used. Therefore, the array order matters. If there is no match (or the source image is [animated](#animated-images)), the Image Optimization API will fallback to the original image's format.\n\nIf no configuration is provided, the default below is used.\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    formats: ['image/webp'],\n  },\n}\n```\n\nYou can enable AVIF support with the following configuration.\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    formats: ['image/avif', 'image/webp'],\n  },\n}\n```\n\n> **Good to know**: AVIF generally takes 20% longer to encode but it compresses 20% smaller compared to WebP. This means that the first time an image is requested, it will typically be slower and then subsequent requests that are cached will be faster.\n\n## [Caching Behavior](#caching-behavior)\n\nThe following describes the caching algorithm for the default [loader](#loader). For all other loaders, please refer to your cloud provider's documentation.\n\nImages are optimized dynamically upon request and stored in the `<distDir>/cache/images` directory. The optimized image file will be served for subsequent requests until the expiration is reached. When a request is made that matches a cached but expired file, the expired image is served stale immediately. Then the image is optimized again in the background (also called revalidation) and saved to the cache with the new expiration date.\n\nThe cache status of an image can be determined by reading the value of the `x-nextjs-cache` (`x-vercel-cache` when deployed on Vercel) response header. The possible values are the following:\n\n*   `MISS` - the path is not in the cache (occurs at most once, on the first visit)\n*   `STALE` - the path is in the cache but exceeded the revalidate time so it will be updated in the background\n*   `HIT` - the path is in the cache and has not exceeded the revalidate time\n\nThe expiration (or rather Max Age) is defined by either the [`minimumCacheTTL`](#minimum-cache-ttl) configuration or the upstream image `Cache-Control` header, whichever is larger. Specifically, the `max-age` value of the `Cache-Control` header is used. If both `s-maxage` and `max-age` are found, then `s-maxage` is preferred. The `max-age` is also passed-through to any downstream clients including CDNs and browsers.\n\n*   You can configure [`minimumCacheTTL`](#minimum-cache-ttl) to increase the cache duration when the upstream image does not include `Cache-Control` header or the value is very low.\n*   You can configure [`deviceSizes`](#device-sizes) and [`imageSizes`](#image-sizes) to reduce the total number of possible generated images.\n*   You can configure [formats](#acceptable-formats) to disable multiple formats in favor of a single image format.\n\n### [Minimum Cache TTL](#minimum-cache-ttl)\n\nYou can configure the Time to Live (TTL) in seconds for cached optimized images. In many cases, it's better to use a [Static Image Import](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/images#local-images) which will automatically hash the file contents and cache the image forever with a `Cache-Control` header of `immutable`.\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    minimumCacheTTL: 60,\n  },\n}\n```\n\nThe expiration (or rather Max Age) of the optimized image is defined by either the `minimumCacheTTL` or the upstream image `Cache-Control` header, whichever is larger.\n\nIf you need to change the caching behavior per image, you can configure [`headers`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/next-config-js/headers) to set the `Cache-Control` header on the upstream image (e.g. `/some-asset.jpg`, not `/_next/image` itself).\n\nThere is no mechanism to invalidate the cache at this time, so its best to keep `minimumCacheTTL` low. Otherwise you may need to manually change the [`src`](#src) prop or delete `<distDir>/cache/images`.\n\n### [Disable Static Imports](#disable-static-imports)\n\nThe default behavior allows you to import static files such as `import icon from './icon.png'` and then pass that to the `src` property.\n\nIn some cases, you may wish to disable this feature if it conflicts with other plugins that expect the import to behave differently.\n\nYou can disable static image imports inside your `next.config.js`:\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    disableStaticImages: true,\n  },\n}\n```\n\n### [Dangerously Allow SVG](#dangerously-allow-svg)\n\nThe default [loader](#loader) does not optimize SVG images for a few reasons. First, SVG is a vector format meaning it can be resized losslessly. Second, SVG has many of the same features as HTML/CSS, which can lead to vulnerabilities without proper [Content Security Policy (CSP) headers](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/headers#content-security-policy).\n\nTherefore, we recommended using the [`unoptimized`](#unoptimized) prop when the [`src`](#src) prop is known to be SVG. This happens automatically when `src` ends with `\".svg\"`.\n\nHowever, if you need to serve SVG images with the default Image Optimization API, you can set `dangerouslyAllowSVG` inside your `next.config.js`:\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    dangerouslyAllowSVG: true,\n    contentDispositionType: 'attachment',\n    contentSecurityPolicy: \"default-src 'self'; script-src 'none'; sandbox;\",\n  },\n}\n```\n\nIn addition, it is strongly recommended to also set `contentDispositionType` to force the browser to download the image, as well as `contentSecurityPolicy` to prevent scripts embedded in the image from executing.\n\n### [Animated Images](#animated-images)\n\nThe default [loader](#loader) will automatically bypass Image Optimization for animated images and serve the image as-is.\n\nAuto-detection for animated files is best-effort and supports GIF, APNG, and WebP. If you want to explicitly bypass Image Optimization for a given animated image, use the [unoptimized](#unoptimized) prop.\n\n## [Version History](#version-history)\n\n| Version | Changes |\n| --- | --- |\n| `v13.0.0` | `next/image` renamed to `next/legacy/image` |",

    "markdown": "# Functions: getServerSideProps | Next.js\n\nWhen exporting a function called `getServerSideProps` (Server-Side Rendering) from a page, Next.js will pre-render this page on each request using the data returned by `getServerSideProps`. This is useful if you want to fetch data that changes often, and have the page update to show the most current data.\n\n```\nimport type { InferGetServerSidePropsType, GetServerSideProps } from 'next'\n \ntype Repo = {\n  name: string\n  stargazers_count: number\n}\n \nexport const getServerSideProps = (async () => {\n  // Fetch data from external API\n  const res = await fetch('https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js')\n  const repo: Repo = await res.json()\n  // Pass data to the page via props\n  return { props: { repo } }\n}) satisfies GetServerSideProps<{ repo: Repo }>\n \nexport default function Page({\n  repo,\n}: InferGetServerSidePropsType<typeof getServerSideProps>) {\n  return (\n    <main>\n      <p>{repo.stargazers_count}</p>\n    </main>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nYou can import modules in top-level scope for use in `getServerSideProps`. Imports used will **not be bundled for the client-side**. This means you can write **server-side code directly in `getServerSideProps`**, including fetching data from your database.\n\n## [Context parameter](#context-parameter)\n\nThe `context` parameter is an object containing the following keys:\n\n| Name | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `params` | If this page uses a [dynamic route](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes), `params` contains the route parameters. If the page name is `[id].js`, then `params` will look like `{ id: ... }`. |\n| `req` | [The `HTTP` IncomingMessage object](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_incomingmessage), with an additional `cookies` prop, which is an object with string keys mapping to string values of cookies. |\n| `res` | [The `HTTP` response object](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_serverresponse). |\n| `query` | An object representing the query string, including dynamic route parameters. |\n| `preview` | (Deprecated for `draftMode`) `preview` is `true` if the page is in the [Preview Mode](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/preview-mode) and `false` otherwise. |\n| `previewData` | (Deprecated for `draftMode`) The [preview](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/preview-mode) data set by `setPreviewData`. |\n| `draftMode` | `draftMode` is `true` if the page is in the [Draft Mode](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/draft-mode) and `false` otherwise. |\n| `resolvedUrl` | A normalized version of the request `URL` that strips the `_next/data` prefix for client transitions and includes original query values. |\n| `locale` | Contains the active locale (if enabled). |\n| `locales` | Contains all supported locales (if enabled). |\n| `defaultLocale` | Contains the configured default locale (if enabled). |\n\n## [getServerSideProps return values](#getserversideprops-return-values)\n\nThe `getServerSideProps` function should return an object with **any one of the following** properties:\n\n### [`props`](#props)\n\nThe `props` object is a key-value pair, where each value is received by the page component. It should be a [serializable object](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Glossary/Serialization) so that any props passed, could be serialized with [`JSON.stringify`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify).\n\n```\nexport async function getServerSideProps(context) {\n  return {\n    props: { message: `Next.js is awesome` }, // will be passed to the page component as props\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### [`notFound`](#notfound)\n\nThe `notFound` boolean allows the page to return a `404` status and [404 Page](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/custom-error#404-page). With `notFound: true`, the page will return a `404` even if there was a successfully generated page before. This is meant to support use cases like user-generated content getting removed by its author.\n\n```\nexport async function getServerSideProps(context) {\n  const res = await fetch(`https://.../data`)\n  const data = await res.json()\n \n  if (!data) {\n    return {\n      notFound: true,\n    }\n  }\n \n  return {\n    props: { data }, // will be passed to the page component as props\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### [`redirect`](#redirect)\n\nThe `redirect` object allows redirecting to internal and external resources. It should match the shape of `{ destination: string, permanent: boolean }`. In some rare cases, you might need to assign a custom status code for older `HTTP` clients to properly redirect. In these cases, you can use the `statusCode` property instead of the `permanent` property, but not both.\n\n```\nexport async function getServerSideProps(context) {\n  const res = await fetch(`https://.../data`)\n  const data = await res.json()\n \n  if (!data) {\n    return {\n      redirect: {\n        destination: '/',\n        permanent: false,\n      },\n    }\n  }\n \n  return {\n    props: {}, // will be passed to the page component as props\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## [Version History](#version-history)\n\n| Version | Changes |\n| --- | --- |\n| `v13.4.0` | [App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching) is now stable with simplified data fetching |\n| `v10.0.0` | `locale`, `locales`, `defaultLocale`, and `notFound` options added. |\n| `v9.3.0` | `getServerSideProps` introduced. |",

    "markdown": "# Upgrading: Migrating from Vite | Next.js\n\nThis guide will help you migrate an existing Vite application to Next.js.\n\n## [Why Switch?](#why-switch)\n\nThere are several reasons why you might want to switch from Vite to Next.js:\n\n### [Slow initial page loading time](#slow-initial-page-loading-time)\n\nIf you have built your application with the [default Vite plugin for React](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/tree/main/packages/plugin-react), your application is a purely client-side application. Client-side only applications, also known as single-page applications (SPAs), often experience slow initial page loading time. This happens due to a couple of reasons:\n\n1.  The browser needs to wait for the React code and your entire application bundle to download and run before your code is able to send requests to load some data.\n2.  Your application code grows with every new feature and extra dependency you add.\n\n### [No automatic code splitting](#no-automatic-code-splitting)\n\nThe previous issue of slow loading times can be somewhat managed with code splitting. However, if you try to do code splitting manually, you'll often make performance worse. It's easy to inadvertently introduce network waterfalls when code-splitting manually. Next.js provides automatic code splitting built into its router.\n\n### [Network waterfalls](#network-waterfalls)\n\nA common cause of poor performance occurs when applications make sequential client-server requests to fetch data. One common pattern for data fetching in an SPA is to initially render a placeholder, and then fetch data after the component has mounted. Unfortunately, this means that a child component that fetches data can't start fetching until the parent component has finished loading its own data.\n\nWhile fetching data on the client is supported with Next.js, it also gives you the option to shift data fetching to the server, which can eliminate client-server waterfalls.\n\n### [Fast and intentional loading states](#fast-and-intentional-loading-states)\n\nWith built-in support for [streaming through React Suspense](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/loading-ui-and-streaming#streaming-with-suspense), you can be more intentional about which parts of your UI you want to load first and in what order without introducing network waterfalls.\n\nThis enables you to build pages that are faster to load and eliminate [layout shifts](https://vercel.com/blog/how-core-web-vitals-affect-seo).\n\n### [Choose the data fetching strategy](#choose-the-data-fetching-strategy)\n\nDepending on your needs, Next.js allows you to choose your data fetching strategy on a page and component basis. You can decide to fetch at build time, at request time on the server, or on the client. For example, you can fetch data from your CMS and render your blog posts at build time, which can then be efficiently cached on a CDN.\n\n### [Middleware](#middleware)\n\n[Next.js Middleware](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware) allows you to run code on the server before a request is completed. This is especially useful to avoid having a flash of unauthenticated content when the user visits an authenticated-only page by redirecting the user to a login page. The middleware is also useful for experimentation and [internationalization](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/internationalization).\n\n### [Built-in Optimizations](#built-in-optimizations)\n\n[Images](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/images), [fonts](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts), and [third-party scripts](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/scripts) often have significant impact on an application's performance. Next.js comes with built-in components that automatically optimize those for you.\n\n## [Migration Steps](#migration-steps)\n\nOur goal with this migration is to get a working Next.js application as quickly as possible, so that you can then adopt Next.js features incrementally. To begin with, we'll keep it as a purely client-side application (SPA) without migrating your existing router. This helps minimize the chances of encountering issues during the migration process and reduces merge conflicts.\n\n### [Step 1: Install the Next.js Dependency](#step-1-install-the-nextjs-dependency)\n\nThe first thing you need to do is to install `next` as a dependency:\n\n### [Step 2: Create the Next.js Configuration File](#step-2-create-the-nextjs-configuration-file)\n\nCreate a `next.config.mjs` at the root of your project. This file will hold your [Next.js configuration options](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js).\n\n```\n/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */\nconst nextConfig = {\n  output: 'export', // Outputs a Single-Page Application (SPA).\n  distDir: './dist', // Changes the build output directory to `./dist/`.\n}\n \nexport default nextConfig\n```\n\n> **Good to know:** You can use either `.js` or `.mjs` for your Next.js configuration file.\n\n### [Step 3: Update TypeScript Configuration](#step-3-update-typescript-configuration)\n\nIf you're using TypeScript, you need to update your `tsconfig.json` file with the following changes to make it compatible with Next.js. If you're not using TypeScript, you can skip this step.\n\n1.  Remove the [project reference](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#references) to `tsconfig.node.json`\n2.  Add `./dist/types/**/*.ts` and `./next-env.d.ts` to the [`include` array](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#include)\n3.  Add `./node_modules` to the [`exclude` array](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#exclude)\n4.  Add `{ \"name\": \"next\" }` to the [`plugins` array in `compilerOptions`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#plugins): `\"plugins\": [{ \"name\": \"next\" }]`\n5.  Set [`esModuleInterop`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#esModuleInterop) to `true`: `\"esModuleInterop\": true`\n6.  Set [`jsx`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#jsx) to `preserve`: `\"jsx\": \"preserve\"`\n7.  Set [`allowJs`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#allowJs) to `true`: `\"allowJs\": true`\n8.  Set [`forceConsistentCasingInFileNames`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#forceConsistentCasingInFileNames) to `true`: `\"forceConsistentCasingInFileNames\": true`\n9.  Set [`incremental`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#incremental) to `true`: `\"incremental\": true`\n\nHere's an example of a working `tsconfig.json` with those changes:\n\n```\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"target\": \"ES2020\",\n    \"useDefineForClassFields\": true,\n    \"lib\": [\"ES2020\", \"DOM\", \"DOM.Iterable\"],\n    \"module\": \"ESNext\",\n    \"esModuleInterop\": true,\n    \"skipLibCheck\": true,\n    \"moduleResolution\": \"bundler\",\n    \"allowImportingTsExtensions\": true,\n    \"resolveJsonModule\": true,\n    \"isolatedModules\": true,\n    \"noEmit\": true,\n    \"jsx\": \"preserve\",\n    \"strict\": true,\n    \"noUnusedLocals\": true,\n    \"noUnusedParameters\": true,\n    \"noFallthroughCasesInSwitch\": true,\n    \"allowJs\": true,\n    \"forceConsistentCasingInFileNames\": true,\n    \"incremental\": true,\n    \"plugins\": [{ \"name\": \"next\" }]\n  },\n  \"include\": [\"./src\", \"./dist/types/**/*.ts\", \"./next-env.d.ts\"],\n  \"exclude\": [\"./node_modules\"]\n}\n```\n\nYou can find more information about configuring TypeScript on the [Next.js docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/typescript#typescript-plugin).\n\n### [Step 4: Create the Root Layout](#step-4-create-the-root-layout)\n\nA Next.js [App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app) application must include a [root layout](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts#root-layout-required) file, which is a [React Server Component](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components) that will wrap all pages in your application. This file is defined at the top level of the `app` directory.\n\nThe closest equivalent to the root layout file in a Vite application is the [`index.html` file](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#index-html-and-project-root), which contains your `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.\n\nIn this step, you'll convert your `index.html` file into a root layout file:\n\n1.  Create a new `app` directory in your `src` directory.\n2.  Create a new `layout.tsx` file inside that `app` directory:\n\n```\nexport default function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return null\n}\n```\n\n> **Good to know**: `.js`, `.jsx`, or `.tsx` extensions can be used for Layout files.\n\n3.  Copy the content of your `index.html` file into the previously created `<RootLayout>` component while replacing the `body.div#root` and `body.script` tags with `<div id=\"root\">{children}</div>`:\n\n```\nexport default function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <head>\n        <meta charset=\"UTF-8\" />\n        <link rel=\"icon\" type=\"image/svg+xml\" href=\"/icon.svg\" />\n        <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\" />\n        <title>My App</title>\n        <meta name=\"description\" content=\"My App is a...\" />\n      </head>\n      <body>\n        <div id=\"root\">{children}</div>\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n4.  Next.js already includes by default the [meta charset](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta#charset) and [meta viewport](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Viewport_meta_tag) tags, so you can safely remove those from your `<head>`:\n\n```\nexport default function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <head>\n        <link rel=\"icon\" type=\"image/svg+xml\" href=\"/icon.svg\" />\n        <title>My App</title>\n        <meta name=\"description\" content=\"My App is a...\" />\n      </head>\n      <body>\n        <div id=\"root\">{children}</div>\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n5.  Any [metadata files](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/metadata#file-based-metadata) such as `favicon.ico`, `icon.png`, `robots.txt` are automatically added to the application `<head>` tag as long as you have them placed into the top level of the `app` directory. After moving [all supported files](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/metadata#file-based-metadata) into the `app` directory you can safely delete their `<link>` tags:\n\n```\nexport default function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <head>\n        <title>My App</title>\n        <meta name=\"description\" content=\"My App is a...\" />\n      </head>\n      <body>\n        <div id=\"root\">{children}</div>\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n6.  Finally, Next.js can manage your last `<head>` tags with the [Metadata API](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/metadata). Move your final metadata info into an exported [`metadata` object](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-metadata#metadata-object):\n\n```\nimport type { Metadata } from 'next'\n \nexport const metadata: Metadata = {\n  title: 'My App',\n  description: 'My App is a...',\n}\n \nexport default function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <body>\n        <div id=\"root\">{children}</div>\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nWith the above changes, you shifted from declaring everything in your `index.html` to using Next.js' convention-based approach built into the framework ([Metadata API](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/metadata)). This approach enables you to more easily improve your SEO and web shareability of your pages.\n\n### [Step 5: Create the Entrypoint Page](#step-5-create-the-entrypoint-page)\n\nOn Next.js you declare an entrypoint for your application by creating a `page.tsx` file. The closest equivalent of this file on Vite is your `main.tsx` file. In this step, you’ll set up the entrypoint of your application.\n\n1.  **Create a `[[...slug]]` directory in your `app` directory.**\n\nSince in this guide we're aiming first to set up our Next.js as an SPA (Single Page Application), you need your page entrypoint to catch all possible routes of your application. For that, create a new `[[...slug]]` directory in your `app` directory.\n\nThis directory is what is called an [optional catch-all route segment](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes#optional-catch-all-segments). Next.js uses a file-system based router where [directories are used to define routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/defining-routes#creating-routes). This special directory will make sure that all routes of your application will be directed to its containing `page.tsx` file.\n\n2.  **Create a new `page.tsx` file inside the `app/[[...slug]]` directory with the following content:**\n\n```\nimport '../../index.css'\n \nexport function generateStaticParams() {\n  return [{ slug: [''] }]\n}\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return '...' // We'll update this\n}\n```\n\n> **Good to know**: `.js`, `.jsx`, or `.tsx` extensions can be used for Page files.\n\nThis file is a [Server Component](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components). When you run `next build`, the file is prerendered into a static asset. It does _not_ require any dynamic code.\n\nThis file imports our global CSS and tells [`generateStaticParams`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-static-params) we are only going to generate one route, the index route at `/`.\n\nNow, let's move the rest of our Vite application which will run client-only.\n\n```\n'use client'\n \nimport React from 'react'\nimport dynamic from 'next/dynamic'\n \nconst App = dynamic(() => import('../../App'), { ssr: false })\n \nexport function ClientOnly() {\n  return <App />\n}\n```\n\nThis file is a [Client Component](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/client-components), defined by the `'use client'` directive. Client Components are still [prerendered to HTML](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/client-components#how-are-client-components-rendered) on the server before being sent to the client.\n\nSince we want a client-only application to start, we can configure Next.js to disable prerendering from the `App` component down.\n\n```\nconst App = dynamic(() => import('../../App'), { ssr: false })\n```\n\nNow, update your entrypoint page to use the new component:\n\n```\nimport '../../index.css'\nimport { ClientOnly } from './client'\n \nexport function generateStaticParams() {\n  return [{ slug: [''] }]\n}\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return <ClientOnly />\n}\n```\n\n### [Step 6: Update Static Image Imports](#step-6-update-static-image-imports)\n\nNext.js handles static image imports slightly different from Vite. With Vite, importing an image file will return its public URL as a string:\n\n```\nimport image from './img.png' // `image` will be '/assets/img.2d8efhg.png' in production\n \nexport default function App() {\n  return <img src={image} />\n}\n```\n\nWith Next.js, static image imports return an object. The object can then be used directly with the Next.js [`<Image>` component](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/components/image), or you can use the object's `src` property with your existing `<img>` tag.\n\nThe `<Image>` component has the added benefits of [automatic image optimization](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/images). The `<Image>` component automatically sets the `width` and `height` attributes of the resulting `<img>` based on the image's dimensions. This prevents layout shifts when the image loads. However, this can cause issues if your app contains images with only one of their dimensions being styled without the other styled to `auto`. When not styled to `auto`, the dimension will default to the `<img>` dimension attribute's value, which can cause the image to appear distorted.\n\nKeeping the `<img>` tag will reduce the amount of changes in your application and prevent the above issues. You can then optionally later migrate to the `<Image>` component to take advantage of optimizing images by [configuring a loader](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/images#loaders), or moving to the default Next.js server which has automatic image optimization.\n\n1.  **Convert absolute import paths for images imported from `/public` into relative imports:**\n\n```\n// Before\nimport logo from '/logo.png'\n \n// After\nimport logo from '../public/logo.png'\n```\n\n2.  **Pass the image `src` property instead of the whole image object to your `<img>` tag:**\n\n```\n// Before\n<img src={logo} />\n \n// After\n<img src={logo.src} />\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can reference the public URL for the image asset based on the filename. For example, `public/logo.png` will serve the image at `/logo.png` for your application, which would be the `src` value.\n\n> **Warning:** If you're using TypeScript, you might encounter type errors when accessing the `src` property. You can safely ignore those for now. They will be fixed by the end of this guide.\n\n### [Step 7: Migrate the Environment Variables](#step-7-migrate-the-environment-variables)\n\nNext.js has support for `.env` [environment variables](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/environment-variables) similar to Vite. The main difference is the prefix used to expose environment variables on the client-side.\n\n*   Change all environment variables with the `VITE_` prefix to `NEXT_PUBLIC_`.\n\nVite exposes a few built-in environment variables on the special `import.meta.env` object which aren’t supported by Next.js. You need to update their usage as follows:\n\n*   `import.meta.env.MODE` ⇒ `process.env.NODE_ENV`\n*   `import.meta.env.PROD` ⇒ `process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'`\n*   `import.meta.env.DEV` ⇒ `process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'`\n*   `import.meta.env.SSR` ⇒ `typeof window !== 'undefined'`\n\nNext.js also doesn't provide a built-in `BASE_URL` environment variable. However, you can still configure one, if you need it:\n\n1.  **Add the following to your `.env` file:**\n\n```\n# ...\nNEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH=\"/some-base-path\"\n```\n\n2.  **Set [`basePath`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/basePath) to `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH` in your `next.config.mjs` file:**\n\n```\n/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */\nconst nextConfig = {\n  output: 'export', // Outputs a Single-Page Application (SPA).\n  distDir: './dist', // Changes the build output directory to `./dist/`.\n  basePath: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH, // Sets the base path to `/some-base-path`.\n}\n \nexport default nextConfig\n```\n\n3.  **Update `import.meta.env.BASE_URL` usages to `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH`**\n\n### [Step 8: Update Scripts in `package.json`](#step-8-update-scripts-in-packagejson)\n\nYou should now be able to run your application to test if you successfully migrated to Next.js. But before that, you need to update your `scripts` in your `package.json` with Next.js related commands, and add `.next` and `next-env.d.ts` to your `.gitignore`:\n\n```\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"dev\": \"next dev\",\n    \"build\": \"next build\",\n    \"start\": \"next start\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n```\n# ...\n.next\nnext-env.d.ts\ndist\n```\n\nNow run `npm run dev`, and open [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000/). You should see your application now running on Next.js.\n\n> **Example:** Check out [this pull request](https://github.com/inngest/vite-to-nextjs/pull/1) for a working example of a Vite application migrated to Next.js.\n\n### [Step 9: Clean Up](#step-9-clean-up)\n\nYou can now clean up your codebase from Vite related artifacts:\n\n*   Delete `main.tsx`\n*   Delete `index.html`\n*   Delete `vite-env.d.ts`\n*   Delete `tsconfig.node.json`\n*   Delete `vite.config.ts`\n*   Uninstall Vite dependencies\n\n## [Next Steps](#next-steps)\n\nIf everything went according to plan, you now have a functioning Next.js application running as a single-page application. However, you aren't yet taking advantage of most of Next.js' benefits, but you can now start making incremental changes to reap all the benefits. Here's what you might want to do next:\n\n*   Migrate from React Router to the [Next.js App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing) to get:\n    *   Automatic code splitting\n    *   [Streaming Server-Rendering](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/loading-ui-and-streaming)\n    *   [React Server Components](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components)\n*   [Optimize images with the `<Image>` component](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/images)\n*   [Optimize fonts with `next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts)\n*   [Optimize third-party scripts with the `<Script>` component](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/scripts)\n*   [Update your ESLint configuration to support Next.js rules](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/eslint)",

    "markdown": "# Configuring: Babel | Next.js\n\nExamples\n\n*   [Customizing babel configuration](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-custom-babel-config)\n\nNext.js includes the `next/babel` preset to your app, which includes everything needed to compile React applications and server-side code. But if you want to extend the default Babel configs, it's also possible.\n\n## [Adding Presets and Plugins](#adding-presets-and-plugins)\n\nTo start, you only need to define a `.babelrc` file (or `babel.config.js`) in the root directory of your project. If such a file is found, it will be considered as the _source of truth_, and therefore it needs to define what Next.js needs as well, which is the `next/babel` preset.\n\nHere's an example `.babelrc` file:\n\n```\n{\n  \"presets\": [\"next/babel\"],\n  \"plugins\": []\n}\n```\n\nYou can [take a look at this file](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/packages/next/src/build/babel/preset.ts) to learn about the presets included by `next/babel`.\n\nTo add presets/plugins **without configuring them**, you can do it this way:\n\n```\n{\n  \"presets\": [\"next/babel\"],\n  \"plugins\": [\"@babel/plugin-proposal-do-expressions\"]\n}\n```\n\n## [Customizing Presets and Plugins](#customizing-presets-and-plugins)\n\nTo add presets/plugins **with custom configuration**, do it on the `next/babel` preset like so:\n\n```\n{\n  \"presets\": [\n    [\n      \"next/babel\",\n      {\n        \"preset-env\": {},\n        \"transform-runtime\": {},\n        \"styled-jsx\": {},\n        \"class-properties\": {}\n      }\n    ]\n  ],\n  \"plugins\": []\n}\n```\n\nTo learn more about the available options for each config, visit babel's [documentation](https://babeljs.io/docs/) site.\n\n> **Good to know**:\n> \n> *   Next.js uses the [**current** Node.js version](https://github.com/nodejs/release#release-schedule) for server-side compilations.\n> *   The `modules` option on `\"preset-env\"` should be kept to `false`, otherwise webpack code splitting is turned off.",

    "markdown": "# Functions: getStaticPaths | Next.js\n\nWhen exporting a function called `getStaticPaths` from a page that uses [Dynamic Routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes), Next.js will statically pre-render all the paths specified by `getStaticPaths`.\n\n```\nimport type {\n  InferGetStaticPropsType,\n  GetStaticProps,\n  GetStaticPaths,\n} from 'next'\n \ntype Repo = {\n  name: string\n  stargazers_count: number\n}\n \nexport const getStaticPaths = (async () => {\n  return {\n    paths: [\n      {\n        params: {\n          name: 'next.js',\n        },\n      }, // See the \"paths\" section below\n    ],\n    fallback: true, // false or \"blocking\"\n  }\n}) satisfies GetStaticPaths\n \nexport const getStaticProps = (async (context) => {\n  const res = await fetch('https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js')\n  const repo = await res.json()\n  return { props: { repo } }\n}) satisfies GetStaticProps<{\n  repo: Repo\n}>\n \nexport default function Page({\n  repo,\n}: InferGetStaticPropsType<typeof getStaticProps>) {\n  return repo.stargazers_count\n}\n```\n\n## [getStaticPaths return values](#getstaticpaths-return-values)\n\nThe `getStaticPaths` function should return an object with the following **required** properties:\n\n### [`paths`](#paths)\n\nThe `paths` key determines which paths will be pre-rendered. For example, suppose that you have a page that uses [Dynamic Routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes) named `pages/posts/[id].js`. If you export `getStaticPaths` from this page and return the following for `paths`:\n\n```\nreturn {\n  paths: [\n    { params: { id: '1' }},\n    {\n      params: { id: '2' },\n      // with i18n configured the locale for the path can be returned as well\n      locale: \"en\",\n    },\n  ],\n  fallback: ...\n}\n```\n\nThen, Next.js will statically generate `/posts/1` and `/posts/2` during `next build` using the page component in `pages/posts/[id].js`.\n\nThe value for each `params` object must match the parameters used in the page name:\n\n*   If the page name is `pages/posts/[postId]/[commentId]`, then `params` should contain `postId` and `commentId`.\n*   If the page name uses [catch-all routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes#catch-all-segments) like `pages/[...slug]`, then `params` should contain `slug` (which is an array). If this array is `['hello', 'world']`, then Next.js will statically generate the page at `/hello/world`.\n*   If the page uses an [optional catch-all route](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes#optional-catch-all-segments), use `null`, `[]`, `undefined` or `false` to render the root-most route. For example, if you supply `slug: false` for `pages/[[...slug]]`, Next.js will statically generate the page `/`.\n\nThe `params` strings are **case-sensitive** and ideally should be normalized to ensure the paths are generated correctly. For example, if `WoRLD` is returned for a param it will only match if `WoRLD` is the actual path visited, not `world` or `World`.\n\nSeparate of the `params` object a `locale` field can be returned when [i18n is configured](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/internationalization), which configures the locale for the path being generated.\n\n### [`fallback: false`](#fallback-false)\n\nIf `fallback` is `false`, then any paths not returned by `getStaticPaths` will result in a **404 page**.\n\nWhen `next build` is run, Next.js will check if `getStaticPaths` returned `fallback: false`, it will then build **only** the paths returned by `getStaticPaths`. This option is useful if you have a small number of paths to create, or new page data is not added often. If you find that you need to add more paths, and you have `fallback: false`, you will need to run `next build` again so that the new paths can be generated.\n\nThe following example pre-renders one blog post per page called `pages/posts/[id].js`. The list of blog posts will be fetched from a CMS and returned by `getStaticPaths`. Then, for each page, it fetches the post data from a CMS using [`getStaticProps`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-static-props).\n\n```\nfunction Post({ post }) {\n  // Render post...\n}\n \n// This function gets called at build time\nexport async function getStaticPaths() {\n  // Call an external API endpoint to get posts\n  const res = await fetch('https://.../posts')\n  const posts = await res.json()\n \n  // Get the paths we want to pre-render based on posts\n  const paths = posts.map((post) => ({\n    params: { id: post.id },\n  }))\n \n  // We'll pre-render only these paths at build time.\n  // { fallback: false } means other routes should 404.\n  return { paths, fallback: false }\n}\n \n// This also gets called at build time\nexport async function getStaticProps({ params }) {\n  // params contains the post `id`.\n  // If the route is like /posts/1, then params.id is 1\n  const res = await fetch(`https://.../posts/${params.id}`)\n  const post = await res.json()\n \n  // Pass post data to the page via props\n  return { props: { post } }\n}\n \nexport default Post\n```\n\n### [`fallback: true`](#fallback-true)\n\nExamples\n\n*   [Static generation of a large number of pages](https://static-tweet.vercel.app/)\n\nIf `fallback` is `true`, then the behavior of `getStaticProps` changes in the following ways:\n\n*   The paths returned from `getStaticPaths` will be rendered to `HTML` at build time by `getStaticProps`.\n*   The paths that have not been generated at build time will **not** result in a 404 page. Instead, Next.js will serve a [“fallback”](#fallback-pages) version of the page on the first request to such a path. Web crawlers, such as Google, won't be served a fallback and instead the path will behave as in [`fallback: 'blocking'`](#fallback-blocking).\n*   When a page with `fallback: true` is navigated to through `next/link` or `next/router` (client-side) Next.js will _not_ serve a fallback and instead the page will behave as [`fallback: 'blocking'`](#fallback-blocking).\n*   In the background, Next.js will statically generate the requested path `HTML` and `JSON`. This includes running `getStaticProps`.\n*   When complete, the browser receives the `JSON` for the generated path. This will be used to automatically render the page with the required props. From the user’s perspective, the page will be swapped from the fallback page to the full page.\n*   At the same time, Next.js adds this path to the list of pre-rendered pages. Subsequent requests to the same path will serve the generated page, like other pages pre-rendered at build time.\n\n> **Good to know**: `fallback: true` is not supported when using [`output: 'export'`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/deploying/static-exports).\n\n#### [When is `fallback: true` useful?](#when-is-fallback-true-useful)\n\n`fallback: true` is useful if your app has a very large number of static pages that depend on data (such as a very large e-commerce site). If you want to pre-render all product pages, the builds would take a very long time.\n\nInstead, you may statically generate a small subset of pages and use `fallback: true` for the rest. When someone requests a page that is not generated yet, the user will see the page with a loading indicator or skeleton component.\n\nShortly after, `getStaticProps` finishes and the page will be rendered with the requested data. From now on, everyone who requests the same page will get the statically pre-rendered page.\n\nThis ensures that users always have a fast experience while preserving fast builds and the benefits of Static Generation.\n\n`fallback: true` will not _update_ generated pages, for that take a look at [Incremental Static Regeneration](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/incremental-static-regeneration).\n\n### [`fallback: 'blocking'`](#fallback-blocking)\n\nIf `fallback` is `'blocking'`, new paths not returned by `getStaticPaths` will wait for the `HTML` to be generated, identical to SSR (hence why _blocking_), and then be cached for future requests so it only happens once per path.\n\n`getStaticProps` will behave as follows:\n\n*   The paths returned from `getStaticPaths` will be rendered to `HTML` at build time by `getStaticProps`.\n*   The paths that have not been generated at build time will **not** result in a 404 page. Instead, Next.js will SSR on the first request and return the generated `HTML`.\n*   When complete, the browser receives the `HTML` for the generated path. From the user’s perspective, it will transition from \"the browser is requesting the page\" to \"the full page is loaded\". There is no flash of loading/fallback state.\n*   At the same time, Next.js adds this path to the list of pre-rendered pages. Subsequent requests to the same path will serve the generated page, like other pages pre-rendered at build time.\n\n`fallback: 'blocking'` will not _update_ generated pages by default. To update generated pages, use [Incremental Static Regeneration](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/incremental-static-regeneration) in conjunction with `fallback: 'blocking'`.\n\n> **Good to know**: `fallback: 'blocking'` is not supported when using [`output: 'export'`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/deploying/static-exports).\n\n### [Fallback pages](#fallback-pages)\n\nIn the “fallback” version of a page:\n\n*   The page’s props will be empty.\n*   Using the [router](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/use-router), you can detect if the fallback is being rendered, `router.isFallback` will be `true`.\n\nThe following example showcases using `isFallback`:\n\n```\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/router'\n \nfunction Post({ post }) {\n  const router = useRouter()\n \n  // If the page is not yet generated, this will be displayed\n  // initially until getStaticProps() finishes running\n  if (router.isFallback) {\n    return <div>Loading...</div>\n  }\n \n  // Render post...\n}\n \n// This function gets called at build time\nexport async function getStaticPaths() {\n  return {\n    // Only `/posts/1` and `/posts/2` are generated at build time\n    paths: [{ params: { id: '1' } }, { params: { id: '2' } }],\n    // Enable statically generating additional pages\n    // For example: `/posts/3`\n    fallback: true,\n  }\n}\n \n// This also gets called at build time\nexport async function getStaticProps({ params }) {\n  // params contains the post `id`.\n  // If the route is like /posts/1, then params.id is 1\n  const res = await fetch(`https://.../posts/${params.id}`)\n  const post = await res.json()\n \n  // Pass post data to the page via props\n  return {\n    props: { post },\n    // Re-generate the post at most once per second\n    // if a request comes in\n    revalidate: 1,\n  }\n}\n \nexport default Post\n```\n\n## [Version History](#version-history)",

    "markdown": "# next.config.js Options: exportPathMap | Next.js\n\n> This feature is exclusive to `next export` and currently **deprecated** in favor of `getStaticPaths` with `pages` or `generateStaticParams` with `app`.\n\nExamples\n\n*   [Static Export](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-static-export)\n\n`exportPathMap` allows you to specify a mapping of request paths to page destinations, to be used during export. Paths defined in `exportPathMap` will also be available when using [`next dev`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-cli#development).\n\nLet's start with an example, to create a custom `exportPathMap` for an app with the following pages:\n\n*   `pages/index.js`\n*   `pages/about.js`\n*   `pages/post.js`\n\nOpen `next.config.js` and add the following `exportPathMap` config:\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  exportPathMap: async function (\n    defaultPathMap,\n    { dev, dir, outDir, distDir, buildId }\n  ) {\n    return {\n      '/': { page: '/' },\n      '/about': { page: '/about' },\n      '/p/hello-nextjs': { page: '/post', query: { title: 'hello-nextjs' } },\n      '/p/learn-nextjs': { page: '/post', query: { title: 'learn-nextjs' } },\n      '/p/deploy-nextjs': { page: '/post', query: { title: 'deploy-nextjs' } },\n    }\n  },\n}\n```\n\n> **Good to know**: the `query` field in `exportPathMap` cannot be used with [automatically statically optimized pages](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/rendering/automatic-static-optimization) or [`getStaticProps` pages](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-static-props) as they are rendered to HTML files at build-time and additional query information cannot be provided during `next export`.\n\nThe pages will then be exported as HTML files, for example, `/about` will become `/about.html`.\n\n`exportPathMap` is an `async` function that receives 2 arguments: the first one is `defaultPathMap`, which is the default map used by Next.js. The second argument is an object with:\n\n*   `dev` - `true` when `exportPathMap` is being called in development. `false` when running `next export`. In development `exportPathMap` is used to define routes.\n*   `dir` - Absolute path to the project directory\n*   `outDir` - Absolute path to the `out/` directory ([configurable with `-o`](#customizing-the-output-directory)). When `dev` is `true` the value of `outDir` will be `null`.\n*   `distDir` - Absolute path to the `.next/` directory (configurable with the [`distDir`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/next-config-js/distDir) config)\n*   `buildId` - The generated build id\n\nThe returned object is a map of pages where the `key` is the `pathname` and the `value` is an object that accepts the following fields:\n\n*   `page`: `String` - the page inside the `pages` directory to render\n*   `query`: `Object` - the `query` object passed to `getInitialProps` when prerendering. Defaults to `{}`\n\n> The exported `pathname` can also be a filename (for example, `/readme.md`), but you may need to set the `Content-Type` header to `text/html` when serving its content if it is different than `.html`.\n\n## [Adding a trailing slash](#adding-a-trailing-slash)\n\nIt is possible to configure Next.js to export pages as `index.html` files and require trailing slashes, `/about` becomes `/about/index.html` and is routable via `/about/`. This was the default behavior prior to Next.js 9.\n\nTo switch back and add a trailing slash, open `next.config.js` and enable the `trailingSlash` config:\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  trailingSlash: true,\n}\n```\n\n## [Customizing the output directory](#customizing-the-output-directory)\n\n[`next export`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/deploying/static-exports) will use `out` as the default output directory, you can customize this using the `-o` argument, like so:\n\n> **Warning**: Using `exportPathMap` is deprecated and is overridden by `getStaticPaths` inside `pages`.

    "markdown": "# Upgrading: From Pages to App\n\nThis guide will help you:\n\n*   [Update your Next.js application from version 12 to version 13](#nextjs-version)\n*   [Upgrade features that work in both the `pages` and the `app` directories](#upgrading-new-features)\n*   [Incrementally migrate your existing application from `pages` to `app`](#migrating-from-pages-to-app)\n\n## [Upgrading](#upgrading)\n\n### [Node.js Version](#nodejs-version)\n\nThe minimum Node.js version is now **v18.17**. See the [Node.js documentation](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v18.x/api/) for more information.\n\n### [Next.js Version](#nextjs-version)\n\nTo update to Next.js version 13, run the following command using your preferred package manager:\n\n```\nnpm install next@latest react@latest react-dom@latest\n```\n\n### [ESLint Version](#eslint-version)\n\nIf you're using ESLint, you need to upgrade your ESLint version:\n\n```\nnpm install -D eslint-config-next@latest\n```\n\n> **Good to know**: You may need to restart the ESLint server in VS Code for the ESLint changes to take effect. Open the Command Palette (`cmd+shift+p` on Mac; `ctrl+shift+p` on Windows) and search for `ESLint: Restart ESLint Server`.\n\n## [Next Steps](#next-steps)\n\nAfter you've updated, see the following sections for next steps:\n\n*   [Upgrade new features](#upgrading-new-features): A guide to help you upgrade to new features such as the improved Image and Link Components.\n*   [Migrate from the `pages` to `app` directory](#migrating-from-pages-to-app): A step-by-step guide to help you incrementally migrate from the `pages` to the `app` directory.\n\n## [Upgrading New Features](#upgrading-new-features)\n\nNext.js 13 introduced the new [App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing) with new features and conventions. The new Router is available in the `app` directory and co-exists with the `pages` directory.\n\nUpgrading to Next.js 13 does **not** require using the new [App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing#the-app-router). You can continue using `pages` with new features that work in both directories, such as the updated [Image component](#image-component), [Link component](#link-component), [Script component](#script-component), and [Font optimization](#font-optimization).\n\n### [`<Image/>` Component](#image-component)\n\nNext.js 12 introduced new improvements to the Image Component with a temporary import: `next/future/image`. These improvements included less client-side JavaScript, easier ways to extend and style images, better accessibility, and native browser lazy loading.\n\nIn version 13, this new behavior is now the default for `next/image`.\n\nThere are two codemods to help you migrate to the new Image Component:\n\n*   [**`next-image-to-legacy-image` codemod**](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/upgrading/codemods#next-image-to-legacy-image): Safely and automatically renames `next/image` imports to `next/legacy/image`. Existing components will maintain the same behavior.\n*   [**`next-image-experimental` codemod**](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/upgrading/codemods#next-image-experimental): Dangerously adds inline styles and removes unused props. This will change the behavior of existing components to match the new defaults. To use this codemod, you need to run the `next-image-to-legacy-image` codemod first.\n\n### [`<Link>` Component](#link-component)\n\nThe [`<Link>` Component](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/linking-and-navigating#link-component) no longer requires manually adding an `<a>` tag as a child. This behavior was added as an experimental option in [version 12.2](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-12-2) and is now the default. In Next.js 13, `<Link>` always renders `<a>` and allows you to forward props to the underlying tag.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n \n// Next.js 12: `<a>` has to be nested otherwise it's excluded\n<Link href=\"/about\">\n  <a>About</a>\n</Link>\n \n// Next.js 13: `<Link>` always renders `<a>` under the hood\n<Link href=\"/about\">\n  About\n</Link>\n```\n\nTo upgrade your links to Next.js 13, you can use the [`new-link` codemod](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/upgrading/codemods#new-link).\n\n### [`<Script>` Component](#script-component)\n\nThe behavior of [`next/script`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/components/script) has been updated to support both `pages` and `app`, but some changes need to be made to ensure a smooth migration:\n\n*   Move any `beforeInteractive` scripts you previously included in `_document.js` to the root layout file (`app/layout.tsx`).\n*   The experimental `worker` strategy does not yet work in `app` and scripts denoted with this strategy will either have to be removed or modified to use a different strategy (e.g. `lazyOnload`).\n*   `onLoad`, `onReady`, and `onError` handlers will not work in Server Components so make sure to move them to a [Client Component](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components) or remove them altogether.\n\n### [Font Optimization](#font-optimization)\n\nPreviously, Next.js helped you optimize fonts by [inlining font CSS](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts). Version 13 introduces the new [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) module which gives you the ability to customize your font loading experience while still ensuring great performance and privacy. `next/font` is supported in both the `pages` and `app` directories.\n\nWhile [inlining CSS](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) still works in `pages`, it does not work in `app`. You should use [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) instead.\n\nSee the [Font Optimization](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) page to learn how to use `next/font`.\n\n## [Migrating from `pages` to `app`](#migrating-from-pages-to-app)\n\n> **🎥 Watch:** Learn how to incrementally adopt the App Router → [YouTube (16 minutes)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQMSietiFm0).\n\nMoving to the App Router may be the first time using React features that Next.js builds on top of such as Server Components, Suspense, and more. When combined with new Next.js features such as [special files](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing#file-conventions) and [layouts](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts#layouts), migration means new concepts, mental models, and behavioral changes to learn.\n\nWe recommend reducing the combined complexity of these updates by breaking down your migration into smaller steps. The `app` directory is intentionally designed to work simultaneously with the `pages` directory to allow for incremental page-by-page migration.\n\n*   The `app` directory supports nested routes _and_ layouts. [Learn more](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing).\n*   Use nested folders to [define routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/defining-routes) and a special `page.js` file to make a route segment publicly accessible. [Learn more](#step-4-migrating-pages).\n*   [Special file conventions](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing#file-conventions) are used to create UI for each route segment. The most common special files are `page.js` and `layout.js`.\n    *   Use `page.js` to define UI unique to a route.\n    *   Use `layout.js` to define UI that is shared across multiple routes.\n    *   `.js`, `.jsx`, or `.tsx` file extensions can be used for special files.\n*   You can colocate other files inside the `app` directory such as components, styles, tests, and more. [Learn more](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing).\n*   Data fetching functions like `getServerSideProps` and `getStaticProps` have been replaced with [a new API](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching) inside `app`. `getStaticPaths` has been replaced with [`generateStaticParams`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-static-params).\n*   `pages/_app.js` and `pages/_document.js` have been replaced with a single `app/layout.js` root layout. [Learn more](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts#root-layout-required).\n*   `pages/_error.js` has been replaced with more granular `error.js` special files. [Learn more](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/error-handling).\n*   `pages/404.js` has been replaced with the [`not-found.js`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/not-found) file.\n*   `pages/api/*` API Routes have been replaced with the [`route.js`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/route) (Route Handler) special file.\n\n### [Step 1: Creating the `app` directory](#step-1-creating-the-app-directory)\n\nUpdate to the latest Next.js version (requires 13.4 or greater):\n\nThen, create a new `app` directory at the root of your project (or `src/` directory).\n\n### [Step 2: Creating a Root Layout](#step-2-creating-a-root-layout)\n\nCreate a new `app/layout.tsx` file inside the `app` directory. This is a [root layout](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts#root-layout-required) that will apply to all routes inside `app`.\n\n```\nexport default function RootLayout({\n  // Layouts must accept a children prop.\n  // This will be populated with nested layouts or pages\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <body>{children}</body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n*   The `app` directory **must** include a root layout.\n*   The root layout must define `<html>`, and `<body>` tags since Next.js does not automatically create them\n*   The root layout replaces the `pages/_app.tsx` and `pages/_document.tsx` files.\n*   `.js`, `.jsx`, or `.tsx` extensions can be used for layout files.\n\nTo manage `<head>` HTML elements, you can use the [built-in SEO support](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/metadata):\n\n```\nimport { Metadata } from 'next'\n \nexport const metadata: Metadata = {\n  title: 'Home',\n  description: 'Welcome to Next.js',\n}\n```\n\n#### [Migrating `_document.js` and `_app.js`](#migrating-_documentjs-and-_appjs)\n\nIf you have an existing `_app` or `_document` file, you can copy the contents (e.g. global styles) to the root layout (`app/layout.tsx`). Styles in `app/layout.tsx` will _not_ apply to `pages/*`. You should keep `_app`/`_document` while migrating to prevent your `pages/*` routes from breaking. Once fully migrated, you can then safely delete them.\n\nIf you are using any React Context providers, they will need to be moved to a [Client Component](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/client-components).\n\n#### [Migrating the `getLayout()` pattern to Layouts (Optional)](#migrating-the-getlayout-pattern-to-layouts-optional)\n\nNext.js recommended adding a [property to Page components](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts#layout-pattern#per-page-layouts) to achieve per-page layouts in the `pages` directory. This pattern can be replaced with native support for [nested layouts](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts#layouts) in the `app` directory.\n\nSee before and after example\n\n**Before**\n\n```\nexport default function DashboardLayout({ children }) {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h2>My Dashboard</h2>\n      {children}\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n```\nimport DashboardLayout from '../components/DashboardLayout'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return <p>My Page</p>\n}\n \nPage.getLayout = function getLayout(page) {\n  return <DashboardLayout>{page}</DashboardLayout>\n}\n```\n\n**After**\n\n*   Remove the `Page.getLayout` property from `pages/dashboard/index.js` and follow the [steps for migrating pages](#step-4-migrating-pages) to the `app` directory.\n    \n    ```\n    export default function Page() {\n      return <p>My Page</p>\n    }\n    ```\n    \n*   Move the contents of `DashboardLayout` into a new [Client Component](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/client-components) to retain `pages` directory behavior.\n    \n    ```\n    'use client' // this directive should be at top of the file, before any imports.\n     \n    // This is a Client Component\n    export default function DashboardLayout({ children }) {\n      return (\n        <div>\n          <h2>My Dashboard</h2>\n          {children}\n        </div>\n      )\n    }\n    ```\n    \n*   Import the `DashboardLayout` into a new `layout.js` file inside the `app` directory.\n    \n    ```\n    import DashboardLayout from './DashboardLayout'\n     \n    // This is a Server Component\n    export default function Layout({ children }) {\n      return <DashboardLayout>{children}</DashboardLayout>\n    }\n    ```\n    \n*   You can incrementally move non-interactive parts of `DashboardLayout.js` (Client Component) into `layout.js` (Server Component) to reduce the amount of component JavaScript you send to the client.\n    \n\n### [Step 3: Migrating `next/head`](#step-3-migrating-nexthead)\n\nIn the `pages` directory, the `next/head` React component is used to manage `<head>` HTML elements such as `title` and `meta` . In the `app` directory, `next/head` is replaced with the new [built-in SEO support](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/metadata).\n\n**Before:**\n\n```\nimport Head from 'next/head'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Head>\n        <title>My page title</title>\n      </Head>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n**After:**\n\n```\nimport { Metadata } from 'next'\n \nexport const metadata: Metadata = {\n  title: 'My Page Title',\n}\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return '...'\n}\n```\n\n[See all metadata options](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-metadata).\n\n### [Step 4: Migrating Pages](#step-4-migrating-pages)\n\n*   Pages in the [`app` directory](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing) are [Server Components](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components) by default. This is different from the `pages` directory where pages are [Client Components](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/client-components).\n*   [Data fetching](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching) has changed in `app`. `getServerSideProps`, `getStaticProps` and `getInitialProps` have been replaced with a simpler API.\n*   The `app` directory uses nested folders to [define routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/defining-routes) and a special `page.js` file to make a route segment publicly accessible.\n*   | `pages` Directory | `app` Directory | Route |\n    | --- | --- | --- |\n    | `index.js` | `page.js` | `/` |\n    | `about.js` | `about/page.js` | `/about` |\n    | `blog/[slug].js` | `blog/[slug]/page.js` | `/blog/post-1` |\n    \n\nWe recommend breaking down the migration of a page into two main steps:\n\n*   Step 1: Move the default exported Page Component into a new Client Component.\n*   Step 2: Import the new Client Component into a new `page.js` file inside the `app` directory.\n\n> **Good to know**: This is the easiest migration path because it has the most comparable behavior to the `pages` directory.\n\n**Step 1: Create a new Client Component**\n\n*   Create a new separate file inside the `app` directory (i.e. `app/home-page.tsx` or similar) that exports a Client Component. To define Client Components, add the `'use client'` directive to the top of the file (before any imports).\n    *   Similar to the Pages Router, there is an [optimization step](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/client-components#full-page-load) to prerender Client Components to static HTML on the initial page load.\n*   Move the default exported page component from `pages/index.js` to `app/home-page.tsx`.\n\n```\n'use client'\n \n// This is a Client Component (same as components in the `pages` directory)\n// It receives data as props, has access to state and effects, and is\n// prerendered on the server during the initial page load.\nexport default function HomePage({ recentPosts }) {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      {recentPosts.map((post) => (\n        <div key={post.id}>{post.title}</div>\n      ))}\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n**Step 2: Create a new page**\n\n*   Create a new `app/page.tsx` file inside the `app` directory. This is a Server Component by default.\n    \n*   Import the `home-page.tsx` Client Component into the page.\n    \n*   If you were fetching data in `pages/index.js`, move the data fetching logic directly into the Server Component using the new [data fetching APIs](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/fetching-caching-and-revalidating). See the [data fetching upgrade guide](#step-6-migrating-data-fetching-methods) for more details.\n    \n    ```\n    // Import your Client Component\n    import HomePage from './home-page'\n     \n    async function getPosts() {\n      const res = await fetch('https://...')\n      const posts = await res.json()\n      return posts\n    }\n     \n    export default async function Page() {\n      // Fetch data directly in a Server Component\n      const recentPosts = await getPosts()\n      // Forward fetched data to your Client Component\n      return <HomePage recentPosts={recentPosts} />\n    }\n    ```\n    \n*   If your previous page used `useRouter`, you'll need to update to the new routing hooks. [Learn more](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-router).\n    \n*   Start your development server and visit [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000/). You should see your existing index route, now served through the app directory.\n    \n\n### [Step 5: Migrating Routing Hooks](#step-5-migrating-routing-hooks)\n\nA new router has been added to support the new behavior in the `app` directory.\n\nIn `app`, you should use the three new hooks imported from `next/navigation`: [`useRouter()`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-router), [`usePathname()`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-pathname), and [`useSearchParams()`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-search-params).\n\n*   The new `useRouter` hook is imported from `next/navigation` and has different behavior to the `useRouter` hook in `pages` which is imported from `next/router`.\n    *   The [`useRouter` hook imported from `next/router`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/use-router) is not supported in the `app` directory but can continue to be used in the `pages` directory.\n*   The new `useRouter` does not return the `pathname` string. Use the separate `usePathname` hook instead.\n*   The new `useRouter` does not return the `query` object. Use the separate `useSearchParams` hook instead.\n*   You can use `useSearchParams` and `usePathname` together to listen to page changes. See the [Router Events](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-router#router-events) section for more details.\n*   These new hooks are only supported in Client Components. They cannot be used in Server Components.\n\n```\n'use client'\n \nimport { useRouter, usePathname, useSearchParams } from 'next/navigation'\n \nexport default function ExampleClientComponent() {\n  const router = useRouter()\n  const pathname = usePathname()\n  const searchParams = useSearchParams()\n \n  // ...\n}\n```\n\nIn addition, the new `useRouter` hook has the following changes:\n\n*   `isFallback` has been removed because `fallback` has [been replaced](#replacing-fallback).\n*   The `locale`, `locales`, `defaultLocales`, `domainLocales` values have been removed because built-in i18n Next.js features are no longer necessary in the `app` directory. [Learn more about i18n](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/internationalization).\n*   `basePath` has been removed. The alternative will not be part of `useRouter`. It has not yet been implemented.\n*   `asPath` has been removed because the concept of `as` has been removed from the new router.\n*   `isReady` has been removed because it is no longer necessary. During [static rendering](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components#static-rendering-default), any component that uses the [`useSearchParams()`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-search-params) hook will skip the prerendering step and instead be rendered on the client at runtime.\n\n[View the `useRouter()` API reference](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-router).\n\n### [Step 6: Migrating Data Fetching Methods](#step-6-migrating-data-fetching-methods)\n\nThe `pages` directory uses `getServerSideProps` and `getStaticProps` to fetch data for pages. Inside the `app` directory, these previous data fetching functions are replaced with a [simpler API](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching) built on top of `fetch()` and `async` React Server Components.\n\n```\nexport default async function Page() {\n  // This request should be cached until manually invalidated.\n  // Similar to `getStaticProps`.\n  // `force-cache` is the default and can be omitted.\n  const staticData = await fetch(`https://...`, { cache: 'force-cache' })\n \n  // This request should be refetched on every request.\n  // Similar to `getServerSideProps`.\n  const dynamicData = await fetch(`https://...`, { cache: 'no-store' })\n \n  // This request should be cached with a lifetime of 10 seconds.\n  // Similar to `getStaticProps` with the `revalidate` option.\n  const revalidatedData = await fetch(`https://...`, {\n    next: { revalidate: 10 },\n  })\n \n  return <div>...</div>\n}\n```\n\n#### [Server-side Rendering (`getServerSideProps`)](#server-side-rendering-getserversideprops)\n\nIn the `pages` directory, `getServerSideProps` is used to fetch data on the server and forward props to the default exported React component in the file. The initial HTML for the page is prerendered from the server, followed by \"hydrating\" the page in the browser (making it interactive).\n\n```\n// `pages` directory\n \nexport async function getServerSideProps() {\n  const res = await fetch(`https://...`)\n  const projects = await res.json()\n \n  return { props: { projects } }\n}\n \nexport default function Dashboard({ projects }) {\n  return (\n    <ul>\n      {projects.map((project) => (\n        <li key={project.id}>{project.name}</li>\n      ))}\n    </ul>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nIn the `app` directory, we can colocate our data fetching inside our React components using [Server Components](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components). This allows us to send less JavaScript to the client, while maintaining the rendered HTML from the server.\n\nBy setting the `cache` option to `no-store`, we can indicate that the fetched data should [never be cached](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/fetching-caching-and-revalidating). This is similar to `getServerSideProps` in the `pages` directory.\n\n```\n// `app` directory\n \n// This function can be named anything\nasync function getProjects() {\n  const res = await fetch(`https://...`, { cache: 'no-store' })\n  const projects = await res.json()\n \n  return projects\n}\n \nexport default async function Dashboard() {\n  const projects = await getProjects()\n \n  return (\n    <ul>\n      {projects.map((project) => (\n        <li key={project.id}>{project.name}</li>\n      ))}\n    </ul>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n#### [Accessing Request Object](#accessing-request-object)\n\nIn the `pages` directory, you can retrieve request-based data based on the Node.js HTTP API.\n\nFor example, you can retrieve the `req` object from `getServerSideProps` and use it to retrieve the request's cookies and headers.\n\n```\n// `pages` directory\n \nexport async function getServerSideProps({ req, query }) {\n  const authHeader = req.getHeaders()['authorization'];\n  const theme = req.cookies['theme'];\n \n  return { props: { ... }}\n}\n \nexport default function Page(props) {\n  return ...\n}\n```\n\nThe `app` directory exposes new read-only functions to retrieve request data:\n\n*   [`headers()`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/headers): Based on the Web Headers API, and can be used inside [Server Components](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components) to retrieve request headers.\n*   [`cookies()`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/cookies): Based on the Web Cookies API, and can be used inside [Server Components](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components) to retrieve cookies.\n\n```\n// `app` directory\nimport { cookies, headers } from 'next/headers'\n \nasync function getData() {\n  const authHeader = headers().get('authorization')\n \n  return '...'\n}\n \nexport default async function Page() {\n  // You can use `cookies()` or `headers()` inside Server Components\n  // directly or in your data fetching function\n  const theme = cookies().get('theme')\n  const data = await getData()\n  return '...'\n}\n```\n\n#### [Static Site Generation (`getStaticProps`)](#static-site-generation-getstaticprops)\n\nIn the `pages` directory, the `getStaticProps` function is used to pre-render a page at build time. This function can be used to fetch data from an external API or directly from a database, and pass this data down to the entire page as it's being generated during the build.\n\n```\n// `pages` directory\n \nexport async function getStaticProps() {\n  const res = await fetch(`https://...`)\n  const projects = await res.json()\n \n  return { props: { projects } }\n}\n \nexport default function Index({ projects }) {\n  return projects.map((project) => <div>{project.name}</div>)\n}\n```\n\nIn the `app` directory, data fetching with [`fetch()`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/fetch) will default to `cache: 'force-cache'`, which will cache the request data until manually invalidated. This is similar to `getStaticProps` in the `pages` directory.\n\n```\n// `app` directory\n \n// This function can be named anything\nasync function getProjects() {\n  const res = await fetch(`https://...`)\n  const projects = await res.json()\n \n  return projects\n}\n \nexport default async function Index() {\n  const projects = await getProjects()\n \n  return projects.map((project) => <div>{project.name}</div>)\n}\n```\n\n#### [Dynamic paths (`getStaticPaths`)](#dynamic-paths-getstaticpaths)\n\nIn the `pages` directory, the `getStaticPaths` function is used to define the dynamic paths that should be pre-rendered at build time.\n\n```\n// `pages` directory\nimport PostLayout from '@/components/post-layout'\n \nexport async function getStaticPaths() {\n  return {\n    paths: [{ params: { id: '1' } }, { params: { id: '2' } }],\n  }\n}\n \nexport async function getStaticProps({ params }) {\n  const res = await fetch(`https://.../posts/${params.id}`)\n  const post = await res.json()\n \n  return { props: { post } }\n}\n \nexport default function Post({ post }) {\n  return <PostLayout post={post} />\n}\n```\n\nIn the `app` directory, `getStaticPaths` is replaced with [`generateStaticParams`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-static-params).\n\n[`generateStaticParams`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-static-params) behaves similarly to `getStaticPaths`, but has a simplified API for returning route parameters and can be used inside [layouts](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts). The return shape of `generateStaticParams` is an array of segments instead of an array of nested `param` objects or a string of resolved paths.\n\n```\n// `app` directory\nimport PostLayout from '@/components/post-layout'\n \nexport async function generateStaticParams() {\n  return [{ id: '1' }, { id: '2' }]\n}\n \nasync function getPost(params) {\n  const res = await fetch(`https://.../posts/${params.id}`)\n  const post = await res.json()\n \n  return post\n}\n \nexport default async function Post({ params }) {\n  const post = await getPost(params)\n \n  return <PostLayout post={post} />\n}\n```\n\nUsing the name `generateStaticParams` is more appropriate than `getStaticPaths` for the new model in the `app` directory. The `get` prefix is replaced with a more descriptive `generate`, which sits better alone now that `getStaticProps` and `getServerSideProps` are no longer necessary. The `Paths` suffix is replaced by `Params`, which is more appropriate for nested routing with multiple dynamic segments.\n\n* * *\n\n#### [Replacing `fallback`](#replacing-fallback)\n\nIn the `pages` directory, the `fallback` property returned from `getStaticPaths` is used to define the behavior of a page that isn't pre-rendered at build time. This property can be set to `true` to show a fallback page while the page is being generated, `false` to show a 404 page, or `blocking` to generate the page at request time.\n\n```\n// `pages` directory\n \nexport async function getStaticPaths() {\n  return {\n    paths: [],\n    fallback: 'blocking'\n  };\n}\n \nexport async function getStaticProps({ params }) {\n  ...\n}\n \nexport default function Post({ post }) {\n  return ...\n}\n```\n\nIn the `app` directory the [`config.dynamicParams` property](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/route-segment-config#dynamicparams) controls how params outside of [`generateStaticParams`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-static-params) are handled:\n\n*   **`true`**: (default) Dynamic segments not included in `generateStaticParams` are generated on demand.\n*   **`false`**: Dynamic segments not included in `generateStaticParams` will return a 404.\n\nThis replaces the `fallback: true | false | 'blocking'` option of `getStaticPaths` in the `pages` directory. The `fallback: 'blocking'` option is not included in `dynamicParams` because the difference between `'blocking'` and `true` is negligible with streaming.\n\n```\n// `app` directory\n \nexport const dynamicParams = true;\n \nexport async function generateStaticParams() {\n  return [...]\n}\n \nasync function getPost(params) {\n  ...\n}\n \nexport default async function Post({ params }) {\n  const post = await getPost(params);\n \n  return ...\n}\n```\n\nWith [`dynamicParams`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/route-segment-config#dynamicparams) set to `true` (the default), when a route segment is requested that hasn't been generated, it will be server-rendered and cached.\n\n#### [Incremental Static Regeneration (`getStaticProps` with `revalidate`)](#incremental-static-regeneration-getstaticprops-with-revalidate)\n\nIn the `pages` directory, the `getStaticProps` function allows you to add a `revalidate` field to automatically regenerate a page after a certain amount of time.\n\n```\n// `pages` directory\n \nexport async function getStaticProps() {\n  const res = await fetch(`https://.../posts`)\n  const posts = await res.json()\n \n  return {\n    props: { posts },\n    revalidate: 60,\n  }\n}\n \nexport default function Index({ posts }) {\n  return (\n    <Layout>\n      <PostList posts={posts} />\n    </Layout>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nIn the `app` directory, data fetching with [`fetch()`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/fetch) can use `revalidate`, which will cache the request for the specified amount of seconds.\n\n```\n// `app` directory\n \nasync function getPosts() {\n  const res = await fetch(`https://.../posts`, { next: { revalidate: 60 } })\n  const data = await res.json()\n \n  return data.posts\n}\n \nexport default async function PostList() {\n  const posts = await getPosts()\n \n  return posts.map((post) => <div>{post.name}</div>)\n}\n```\n\n#### [API Routes](#api-routes)\n\nAPI Routes continue to work in the `pages/api` directory without any changes. However, they have been replaced by [Route Handlers](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-handlers) in the `app` directory.\n\nRoute Handlers allow you to create custom request handlers for a given route using the Web [Request](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Request) and [Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Response) APIs.\n\n```\nexport async function GET(request: Request) {}\n```\n\n> **Good to know**: If you previously used API routes to call an external API from the client, you can now use [Server Components](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components) instead to securely fetch data. Learn more about [data fetching](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/fetching-caching-and-revalidating).\n\n### [Step 7: Styling](#step-7-styling)\n\nIn the `pages` directory, global stylesheets are restricted to only `pages/_app.js`. With the `app` directory, this restriction has been lifted. Global styles can be added to any layout, page, or component.\n\n*   [CSS Modules](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/styling/css-modules)\n*   [Tailwind CSS](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/styling/tailwind-css)\n*   [Global Styles](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/styling/css-modules#global-styles)\n*   [CSS-in-JS](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/styling/css-in-js)\n*   [External Stylesheets](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/styling/css-modules#external-stylesheets)\n*   [Sass](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/styling/sass)\n\n#### [Tailwind CSS](#tailwind-css)\n\nIf you're using Tailwind CSS, you'll need to add the `app` directory to your `tailwind.config.js` file:\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  content: [\n    './app/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}', // <-- Add this line\n    './pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}',\n    './components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}',\n  ],\n}\n```\n\nYou'll also need to import your global styles in your `app/layout.js` file:\n\n```\nimport '../styles/globals.css'\n \nexport default function RootLayout({ children }) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <body>{children}</body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nLearn more about [styling with Tailwind CSS](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/styling/tailwind-css)\n\n## [Codemods](#codemods)\n\nNext.js provides Codemod transformations to help upgrade your codebase when a feature is deprecated.

See [\"Customizing Plugins\"](#customizing-plugins) below for more information.\n\nClick to view the configuration to enable CSS Grid Layout\n\n```\n{\n  \"plugins\": [\n    \"postcss-flexbugs-fixes\",\n    [\n      \"postcss-preset-env\",\n      {\n        \"autoprefixer\": {\n          \"flexbox\": \"no-2009\",\n          \"grid\": \"autoplace\"\n        },\n        \"stage\": 3,\n        \"features\": {\n          \"custom-properties\": false\n        }\n      }\n    ]\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nCSS variables are not compiled because it is [not possible to safely do so](https://github.com/MadLittleMods/postcss-css-variables#caveats). If you must use variables, consider using something like [Sass variables](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/variables) which are compiled away by [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/).\n\n## [Customizing Target Browsers](#customizing-target-browsers)\n\nNext.js allows you to configure the target browsers (for [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) and compiled css features) through [Browserslist](https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist).\n\nTo customize browserslist, create a `browserslist` key in your `package.json` like so:\n\n```\n{\n  \"browserslist\": [\">0.3%\", \"not dead\", \"not op_mini all\"]\n}\n```\n\nYou can use the [browsersl.ist](https://browsersl.ist/?q=%3E0.3%25%2C+not+ie+11%2C+not+dead%2C+not+op_mini+all) tool to visualize what browsers you are targeting.\n\n## [CSS Modules](#css-modules)\n\nNo configuration is needed to support CSS Modules. To enable CSS Modules for a file, rename the file to have the extension `.module.css`.\n\nYou can learn more about [Next.js' CSS Module support here](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/styling).\n\n## [Customizing Plugins](#customizing-plugins)\n\n> **Warning**: When you define a custom PostCSS configuration file, Next.js **completely disables** the [default behavior](#default-behavior). Be sure to manually configure all the features you need compiled, including [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer). You also need to install any plugins included in your custom configuration manually, i.e. `npm install postcss-flexbugs-fixes postcss-preset-env`.\n\nTo customize the PostCSS configuration, create a `postcss.config.json` file in the root of your project.\n\nThis is the default configuration used by Next.js:\n\n```\n{\n  \"plugins\": [\n    \"postcss-flexbugs-fixes\",\n    [\n      \"postcss-preset-env\",\n      {\n        \"autoprefixer\": {\n          \"flexbox\": \"no-2009\"\n        },\n        \"stage\": 3,\n        \"features\": {\n          \"custom-properties\": false\n        }\n      }\n    ]\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n> **Good to know**: Next.js also allows the file to be named `.postcssrc.json`, or, to be read from the `postcss` key in `package.json`.\n\nIt is also possible to configure PostCSS with a `postcss.config.js` file, which is useful when you want to conditionally include plugins based on environment:\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  plugins:\n    process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'\n      ? [\n          'postcss-flexbugs-fixes',\n          [\n            'postcss-preset-env',\n            {\n              autoprefixer: {\n                flexbox: 'no-2009',\n              },\n              stage: 3,\n              features: {\n                'custom-properties': false,\n              },\n            },\n          ],\n        ]\n      : [\n          // No transformations in development\n        ],\n}\n```\n\n> **Good to know**: Next.js also allows the file to be named `.postcssrc.js`.\n\nDo **not use `require()`** to import the PostCSS Plugins. Plugins must be provided as strings.\n\n> **Good to know**: If your `postcss.config.js` needs to support other non-Next.js tools in the same project, you must use the interoperable object-based format instead:\n> \n> ```\n> module.exports = {\n>   plugins: {\n>     'postcss-flexbugs-fixes': {},\n>     'postcss-preset-env': {\n>       autoprefixer: {\n>         flexbox: 'no-2009',\n>       },\n>       stage: 3,\n>       features: {\n>         'custom-properties': false,\n>       },\n>     },\n>   },\n> }\n> ```",

    "markdown": "# Upgrading: Migrating from Create React App\n\nThis guide will help you migrate an existing Create React App site to Next.js.\n\n## [Why Switch?](#why-switch)\n\nThere are several reasons why you might want to switch from Create React App to Next.js:\n\n### [Slow initial page loading time](#slow-initial-page-loading-time)\n\nCreate React App uses purely client-side React. Client-side only applications, also known as single-page applications (SPAs), often experience slow initial page loading time. This happens due to a couple of reasons:\n\n1.  The browser needs to wait for the React code and your entire application bundle to download and run before your code is able to send requests to load data.\n2.  Your application code grows with every new feature and dependency you add.\n\n### [No automatic code splitting](#no-automatic-code-splitting)\n\nThe previous issue of slow loading times can be somewhat managed with code splitting. However, if you try to do code splitting manually, you'll often make performance worse. It's easy to inadvertently introduce network waterfalls when code-splitting manually. Next.js provides automatic code splitting built into its router.\n\n### [Network waterfalls](#network-waterfalls)\n\nA common cause of poor performance occurs when applications make sequential client-server requests to fetch data. One common pattern for data fetching in an SPA is to initially render a placeholder, and then fetch data after the component has mounted. Unfortunately, this means that a child component that fetches data can't start fetching until the parent component has finished loading its own data.\n\nWhile fetching data on the client is supported with Next.js, it also gives you the option to shift data fetching to the server, which can eliminate client-server waterfalls.\n\n### [Fast and intentional loading states](#fast-and-intentional-loading-states)\n\nWith built-in support for [streaming through React Suspense](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/loading-ui-and-streaming#streaming-with-suspense), you can be more intentional about which parts of your UI you want to load first and in what order without introducing network waterfalls.\n\nThis enables you to build pages that are faster to load and eliminate [layout shifts](https://vercel.com/blog/how-core-web-vitals-affect-seo).\n\n### [Choose the data fetching strategy](#choose-the-data-fetching-strategy)\n\nDepending on your needs, Next.js allows you to choose your data fetching strategy on a page and component basis. You can decide to fetch at build time, at request time on the server, or on the client. For example, you can fetch data from your CMS and render your blog posts at build time, which can then be efficiently cached on a CDN.\n\n### [Middleware](#middleware)\n\n[Next.js Middleware](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware) allows you to run code on the server before a request is completed. This is especially useful to avoid having a flash of unauthenticated content when the user visits an authenticated-only page by redirecting the user to a login page. The middleware is also useful for experimentation and [internationalization](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/internationalization).\n\n### [Built-in Optimizations](#built-in-optimizations)\n\n[Images](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/images), [fonts](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts), and [third-party scripts](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/scripts) often have significant impact on an application's performance. Next.js comes with built-in components that automatically optimize those for you.\n\n## [Migration Steps](#migration-steps)\n\nOur goal with this migration is to get a working Next.js application as quickly as possible, so that you can then adopt Next.js features incrementally. To begin with, we'll keep it as a purely client-side application (SPA) without migrating your existing router. This helps minimize the chances of encountering issues during the migration process and reduces merge conflicts.\n\n### [Step 1: Install the Next.js Dependency](#step-1-install-the-nextjs-dependency)\n\nThe first thing you need to do is to install `next` as a dependency:\n\n### [Step 2: Create the Next.js Configuration File](#step-2-create-the-nextjs-configuration-file)\n\nCreate a `next.config.mjs` at the root of your project. This file will hold your [Next.js configuration options](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js).\n\n```\n/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */\nconst nextConfig = {\n  output: 'export', // Outputs a Single-Page Application (SPA).\n  distDir: './dist', // Changes the build output directory to `./dist/`.\n}\n \nexport default nextConfig\n```\n\n### [Step 3: Update TypeScript Configuration](#step-3-update-typescript-configuration)\n\nIf you're using TypeScript, you need to update your `tsconfig.json` file with the following changes to make it compatible with Next.js:\n\n```\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"target\": \"es5\",\n    \"lib\": [\"dom\", \"dom.iterable\", \"esnext\"],\n    \"allowJs\": true,\n    \"skipLibCheck\": true,\n    \"strict\": false,\n    \"forceConsistentCasingInFileNames\": true,\n    \"noEmit\": true,\n    \"esModuleInterop\": true,\n    \"module\": \"esnext\",\n    \"moduleResolution\": \"node\",\n    \"resolveJsonModule\": true,\n    \"isolatedModules\": true,\n    \"jsx\": \"preserve\",\n    \"baseUrl\": \".\",\n    \"incremental\": true,\n    \"plugins\": [\n      {\n        \"name\": \"next\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"strictNullChecks\": true\n  },\n  \"include\": [\n    \"next-env.d.ts\",\n    \"**/*.ts\",\n    \"**/*.tsx\",\n    \".next/types/**/*.ts\",\n    \"./dist/types/**/*.ts\"\n  ],\n  \"exclude\": [\"node_modules\"]\n}\n```\n\nYou can find more information about configuring TypeScript on the [Next.js docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/typescript#typescript-plugin).\n\n### [Step 4: Create the Root Layout](#step-4-create-the-root-layout)\n\nA Next.js [App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app) application must include a [root layout](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts#root-layout-required) file, which is a [React Server Component](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components) that will wrap all pages in your application. This file is defined at the top level of the `app` directory.\n\nThe closest equivalent to the root layout file in a CRA application is the `index.html` file, which contains your `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.\n\nIn this step, you'll convert your `index.html` file into a root layout file:\n\n1.  Create a new `app` directory in your `src` directory.\n2.  Create a new `layout.tsx` file inside that `app` directory:\n\n```\nexport default function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return null\n}\n```\n\n> **Good to know**: `.js`, `.jsx`, or `.tsx` extensions can be used for Layout files.\n\nCopy the content of your `index.html` file into the previously created `<RootLayout>` component while replacing the `body.div#root` and `body.script` tags with `<div id=\"root\">{children}</div>`:\n\n```\nexport default function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <head>\n        <meta charset=\"UTF-8\" />\n        <link rel=\"icon\" href=\"%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico\" />\n        <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" />\n        <title>React App</title>\n        <meta name=\"description\" content=\"Web site created...\" />\n      </head>\n      <body>\n        <div id=\"root\">{children}</div>\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n> **Good to know**: We'll ignore the [manifest file](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/metadata), additional iconography other than the favicon, and [testing configuration](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/testing), but if these are requirements, Next.js also supports these options.\n\n### [Step 5: Metadata](#step-5-metadata)\n\nNext.js already includes by default the [meta charset](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta#charset) and [meta viewport](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Viewport_meta_tag) tags, so you can safely remove those from your `<head>`:\n\n```\nexport default function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <head>\n        <link rel=\"icon\" href=\"%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico\" />\n        <title>React App</title>\n        <meta name=\"description\" content=\"Web site created...\" />\n      </head>\n      <body>\n        <div id=\"root\">{children}</div>\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nAny [metadata files](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/metadata#file-based-metadata) such as `favicon.ico`, `icon.png`, `robots.txt` are automatically added to the application `<head>` tag as long as you have them placed into the top level of the `app` directory. After moving [all supported files](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/metadata#file-based-metadata) into the `app` directory you can safely delete their `<link>` tags:\n\n```\nexport default function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <head>\n        <title>React App</title>\n        <meta name=\"description\" content=\"Web site created...\" />\n      </head>\n      <body>\n        <div id=\"root\">{children}</div>\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nFinally, Next.js can manage your last `<head>` tags with the [Metadata API](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/metadata). Move your final metadata info into an exported [`metadata` object](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-metadata#metadata-object):\n\n```\nimport type { Metadata } from 'next'\n \nexport const metadata: Metadata = {\n  title: 'React App',\n  description: 'Web site created with Next.js.',\n}\n \nexport default function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode\n}) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <body>\n        <div id=\"root\">{children}</div>\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nWith the above changes, you shifted from declaring everything in your `index.html` to using Next.js' convention-based approach built into the framework ([Metadata API](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/metadata)). This approach enables you to more easily improve your SEO and web shareability of your pages.\n\n### [Step 6: Styles](#step-6-styles)\n\nLike Create React App, Next.js has built-in support for [CSS Modules](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/styling/css-modules).\n\nIf you're using a global CSS file, import it into your `app/layout.tsx` file:\n\n```\nimport '../index.css'\n \n// ...\n```\n\nIf you're using Tailwind, you'll need to install `postcss` and `autoprefixer`:\n\n```\nnpm install postcss autoprefixer\n```\n\nThen, create a `postcss.config.js` file at the root of your project:\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  plugins: {\n    tailwindcss: {},\n    autoprefixer: {},\n  },\n}\n```\n\n### [Step 7: Create the Entrypoint Page](#step-7-create-the-entrypoint-page)\n\nOn Next.js you declare an entrypoint for your application by creating a `page.tsx` file. The closest equivalent of this file on CRA is your `src/index.tsx` file. In this step, you’ll set up the entry point of your application.\n\n**Create a `[[...slug]]` directory in your `app` directory.**\n\nSince this guide is aiming to first set up our Next.js as an SPA (Single Page Application), you need your page entry point to catch all possible routes of your application. For that, create a new `[[...slug]]` directory in your `app` directory.\n\nThis directory is what is called an [optional catch-all route segment](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes#optional-catch-all-segments). Next.js uses a file-system based router where [directories are used to define routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/defining-routes#creating-routes). This special directory will make sure that all routes of your application will be directed to its containing `page.tsx` file.\n\n**Create a new `page.tsx` file inside the `app/[[...slug]]` directory with the following content:**\n\n```\nimport '../../index.css'\n \nexport function generateStaticParams() {\n  return [{ slug: [''] }]\n}\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return '...' // We'll update this\n}\n```\n\nThis file is a [Server Component](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components). When you run `next build`, the file is prerendered into a static asset. It does _not_ require any dynamic code.\n\nThis file imports our global CSS and tells [`generateStaticParams`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-static-params) we are only going to generate one route, the index route at `/`.\n\nNow, let's move the rest of our CRA application which will run client-only.\n\n```\n'use client'\n \nimport React from 'react'\nimport dynamic from 'next/dynamic'\n \nconst App = dynamic(() => import('../../App'), { ssr: false })\n \nexport function ClientOnly() {\n  return <App />\n}\n```\n\nThis file is a [Client Component](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/client-components), defined by the `'use client'` directive. Client Components are still [prerendered to HTML](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/client-components#how-are-client-components-rendered) on the server before being sent to the client.\n\nSince we want a client-only application to start, we can configure Next.js to disable prerendering from the `App` component down.\n\n```\nconst App = dynamic(() => import('../../App'), { ssr: false })\n```\n\nNow, update your entrypoint page to use the new component:\n\n```\nimport '../../index.css'\nimport { ClientOnly } from './client'\n \nexport function generateStaticParams() {\n  return [{ slug: [''] }]\n}\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return <ClientOnly />\n}\n```\n\n### [Step 8: Update Static Image Imports](#step-8-update-static-image-imports)\n\nNext.js handles static image imports slightly different from CRA. With CRA, importing an image file will return its public URL as a string:\n\n```\nimport image from './img.png'\n \nexport default function App() {\n  return <img src={image} />\n}\n```\n\nWith Next.js, static image imports return an object. The object can then be used directly with the Next.js [`<Image>` component](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/components/image), or you can use the object's `src` property with your existing `<img>` tag.\n\nThe `<Image>` component has the added benefits of [automatic image optimization](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/images). The `<Image>` component automatically sets the `width` and `height` attributes of the resulting `<img>` based on the image's dimensions. This prevents layout shifts when the image loads. However, this can cause issues if your app contains images with only one of their dimensions being styled without the other styled to `auto`. When not styled to `auto`, the dimension will default to the `<img>` dimension attribute's value, which can cause the image to appear distorted.\n\nKeeping the `<img>` tag will reduce the amount of changes in your application and prevent the above issues. You can then optionally later migrate to the `<Image>` component to take advantage of optimizing images by [configuring a loader](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/images#loaders), or moving to the default Next.js server which has automatic image optimization.\n\n**Convert absolute import paths for images imported from `/public` into relative imports:**\n\n```\n// Before\nimport logo from '/logo.png'\n \n// After\nimport logo from '../public/logo.png'\n```\n\n**Pass the image `src` property instead of the whole image object to your `<img>` tag:**\n\n```\n// Before\n<img src={logo} />\n \n// After\n<img src={logo.src} />\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can reference the public URL for the image asset based on the filename. For example, `public/logo.png` will serve the image at `/logo.png` for your application, which would be the `src` value.\n\n> **Warning:** If you're using TypeScript, you might encounter type errors when accessing the `src` property. You can safely ignore those for now. They will be fixed by the end of this guide.\n\n### [Step 9: Migrate the Environment Variables](#step-9-migrate-the-environment-variables)\n\nNext.js has support for `.env` [environment variables](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/environment-variables) similar to CRA.\n\nThe main difference is the prefix used to expose environment variables on the client-side. Change all environment variables with the `REACT_APP_` prefix to `NEXT_PUBLIC_`.\n\n### [Step 10: Update Scripts in `package.json`](#step-10-update-scripts-in-packagejson)\n\nYou should now be able to run your application to test if you successfully migrated to Next.js. But before that, you need to update your `scripts` in your `package.json` with Next.js related commands, and add `.next`, `next-env.d.ts`, and `dist` to your `.gitignore` file:\n\n```\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"dev\": \"next dev\",\n    \"build\": \"next build\",\n    \"start\": \"next start\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n```\n# ...\n.next\nnext-env.d.ts\ndist\n```\n\nNow run `npm run dev`, and open [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000/). You should see your application now running on Next.js.\n\n### [Step 11: Clean Up](#step-11-clean-up)\n\nYou can now clean up your codebase from Create React App related artifacts:\n\n*   Delete `src/index.tsx`\n*   Delete `public/index.html`\n*   Delete `reportWebVitals` setup\n*   Uninstall CRA dependencies (`react-scripts`)\n\n## [Bundler Compatibility](#bundler-compatibility)\n\nCreate React App and Next.js both default to using webpack for bundling.\n\nWhen migrating your CRA application to Next.js, you might have a custom webpack configuration you're looking to migrate. Next.js supports providing a [custom webpack configuration](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/webpack).\n\nFurther, Next.js has support for [Turbopack](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/turbo) through `next dev --turbo` to improve your local dev performance. Turbopack supports some [webpack loaders](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/turbo) as well for compatibility and incremental adoption.\n\n## [Next Steps](#next-steps)\n\nIf everything went according to plan, you now have a functioning Next.js application running as a single-page application. However, you aren't yet taking advantage of most of Next.js' benefits, but you can now start making incremental changes to reap all the benefits. Here's what you might want to do next:\n\n*   Migrate from React Router to the [Next.js App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing) to get:\n    *   Automatic code splitting\n    *   [Streaming Server-Rendering](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/loading-ui-and-streaming)\n    *   [React Server Components](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components)\n*   [Optimize images with the `<Image>` component](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/images)\n*   [Optimize fonts with `next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts)\n*   [Optimize third-party scripts with the `<Script>` component](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/scripts)\n*   [Update your ESLint configuration to support Next.js rules](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/eslint)\n\n> **Good to know:** Using a static export [does not currently support](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/54393) using the `useParams` hook.",

The same build should be used and boot up multiple containers.\n\nIf you are rebuilding for each stage of your environment, you will need to generate a consistent build ID to use between containers. Use the `generateBuildId` command in `next.config.js`:\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  generateBuildId: async () => {\n    // This could be anything, using the latest git hash\n    return process.env.GIT_HASH\n  },\n}\n```",

    "markdown": "# Functions: getStaticProps | Next.js\n\nExporting a function called `getStaticProps` will pre-render a page at build time using the props returned from the function:\n\n```\nimport type { InferGetStaticPropsType, GetStaticProps } from 'next'\n \ntype Repo = {\n  name: string\n  stargazers_count: number\n}\n \nexport const getStaticProps = (async (context) => {\n  const res = await fetch('https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js')\n  const repo = await res.json()\n  return { props: { repo } }\n}) satisfies GetStaticProps<{\n  repo: Repo\n}>\n \nexport default function Page({\n  repo,\n}: InferGetStaticPropsType<typeof getStaticProps>) {\n  return repo.stargazers_count\n}\n```\n\nYou can import modules in top-level scope for use in `getStaticProps`. Imports used will **not be bundled for the client-side**. This means you can write **server-side code directly in `getStaticProps`**, including fetching data from your database.\n\n## [Context parameter](#context-parameter)\n\nThe `context` parameter is an object containing the following keys:\n\n| Name | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `params` | Contains the route parameters for pages using [dynamic routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes). For example, if the page name is `[id].js`, then `params` will look like `{ id: ... }`. You should use this together with `getStaticPaths`, which we'll explain later. |\n| `preview` | (Deprecated for `draftMode`) `preview` is `true` if the page is in the [Preview Mode](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/preview-mode) and `false` otherwise. |\n| `previewData` | (Deprecated for `draftMode`) The [preview](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/preview-mode) data set by `setPreviewData`. |\n| `draftMode` | `draftMode` is `true` if the page is in the [Draft Mode](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/draft-mode) and `false` otherwise. |\n| `locale` | Contains the active locale (if enabled). |\n| `locales` | Contains all supported locales (if enabled). |\n| `defaultLocale` | Contains the configured default locale (if enabled). |\n| `revalidateReason` | Provides a reason for why the function was called. Can be one of: \"build\" (run at build time), \"stale\" (revalidate period expired, or running in [development mode](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-static-props#runs-on-every-request-in-development)), \"on-demand\" (triggered via [on-demand revalidation](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/incremental-static-regeneration#on-demand-revalidation)) |\n\n## [getStaticProps return values](#getstaticprops-return-values)\n\nThe `getStaticProps` function should return an object containing either `props`, `redirect`, or `notFound` followed by an **optional** `revalidate` property.\n\n### [`props`](#props)\n\nThe `props` object is a key-value pair, where each value is received by the page component. It should be a [serializable object](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Glossary/Serialization) so that any props passed, could be serialized with [`JSON.stringify`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify).\n\n```\nexport async function getStaticProps(context) {\n  return {\n    props: { message: `Next.js is awesome` }, // will be passed to the page component as props\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### [`revalidate`](#revalidate)\n\nThe `revalidate` property is the amount in seconds after which a page re-generation can occur (defaults to `false` or no revalidation).\n\n```\n// This function gets called at build time on server-side.\n// It may be called again, on a serverless function, if\n// revalidation is enabled and a new request comes in\nexport async function getStaticProps() {\n  const res = await fetch('https://.../posts')\n  const posts = await res.json()\n \n  return {\n    props: {\n      posts,\n    },\n    // Next.js will attempt to re-generate the page:\n    // - When a request comes in\n    // - At most once every 10 seconds\n    revalidate: 10, // In seconds\n  }\n}\n```\n\nLearn more about [Incremental Static Regeneration](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/incremental-static-regeneration).\n\nThe cache status of a page leveraging ISR can be determined by reading the value of the `x-nextjs-cache` response header. The possible values are the following:\n\n*   `MISS` - the path is not in the cache (occurs at most once, on the first visit)\n*   `STALE` - the path is in the cache but exceeded the revalidate time so it will be updated in the background\n*   `HIT` - the path is in the cache and has not exceeded the revalidate time\n\n### [`notFound`](#notfound)\n\nThe `notFound` boolean allows the page to return a `404` status and [404 Page](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/custom-error#404-page). With `notFound: true`, the page will return a `404` even if there was a successfully generated page before. This is meant to support use cases like user-generated content getting removed by its author. Note, `notFound` follows the same `revalidate` behavior [described here](#revalidate).\n\n```\nexport async function getStaticProps(context) {\n  const res = await fetch(`https://.../data`)\n  const data = await res.json()\n \n  if (!data) {\n    return {\n      notFound: true,\n    }\n  }\n \n  return {\n    props: { data }, // will be passed to the page component as props\n  }\n}\n```\n\n> **Good to know**: `notFound` is not needed for [`fallback: false`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/get-static-paths#fallback-false) mode as only paths returned from `getStaticPaths` will be pre-rendered.\n\n### [`redirect`](#redirect)\n\nThe `redirect` object allows redirecting to internal or external resources. It should match the shape of `{ destination: string, permanent: boolean }`.\n\nIn some rare cases, you might need to assign a custom status code for older `HTTP` clients to properly redirect. In these cases, you can use the `statusCode` property instead of the `permanent` property, **but not both**. You can also set `basePath: false` similar to redirects in `next.config.js`.\n\n```\nexport async function getStaticProps(context) {\n  const res = await fetch(`https://...`)\n  const data = await res.json()\n \n  if (!data) {\n    return {\n      redirect: {\n        destination: '/',\n        permanent: false,\n        // statusCode: 301\n      },\n    }\n  }\n \n  return {\n    props: { data }, // will be passed to the page component as props\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIf the redirects are known at build-time, they should be added in [`next.config.js`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/next-config-js/redirects) instead.\n\n## [Reading files: Use `process.cwd()`](#reading-files-use-processcwd)\n\nFiles can be read directly from the filesystem in `getStaticProps`.\n\nIn order to do so you have to get the full path to a file.\n\nSince Next.js compiles your code into a separate directory you can't use `__dirname` as the path it returns will be different from the Pages Router.\n\nInstead you can use `process.cwd()` which gives you the directory where Next.js is being executed.\n\n```\nimport { promises as fs } from 'fs'\nimport path from 'path'\n \n// posts will be populated at build time by getStaticProps()\nfunction Blog({ posts }) {\n  return (\n    <ul>\n      {posts.map((post) => (\n        <li>\n          <h3>{post.filename}</h3>\n          <p>{post.content}</p>\n        </li>\n      ))}\n    </ul>\n  )\n}\n \n// This function gets called at build time on server-side.\n// It won't be called on client-side, so you can even do\n// direct database queries.\nexport async function getStaticProps() {\n  const postsDirectory = path.join(process.cwd(), 'posts')\n  const filenames = await fs.readdir(postsDirectory)\n \n  const posts = filenames.map(async (filename) => {\n    const filePath = path.join(postsDirectory, filename)\n    const fileContents = await fs.readFile(filePath, 'utf8')\n \n    // Generally you would parse/transform the contents\n    // For example you can transform markdown to HTML here\n \n    return {\n      filename,\n      content: fileContents,\n    }\n  })\n  // By returning { props: { posts } }, the Blog component\n  // will receive `posts` as a prop at build time\n  return {\n    props: {\n      posts: await Promise.all(posts),\n    },\n  }\n}\n \nexport default Blog\n```\n\n## [Version History](#version-history)",

    "markdown": "# Configuring: Custom Server | Next.js\n\nExamples\n\n*   [Custom Server](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/custom-server)\n*   [SSR Caching](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/ssr-caching)\n\nBy default, Next.js includes its own server with `next start`. If you have an existing backend, you can still use it with Next.js (this is not a custom server). A custom Next.js server allows you to start a server 100% programmatically in order to use custom server patterns. Most of the time, you will not need this - but it's available for complete customization.\n\n> **Good to know**:\n> \n> *   Before deciding to use a custom server, please keep in mind that it should only be used when the integrated router of Next.js can't meet your app requirements. A custom server will remove important performance optimizations, like **serverless functions** and **[Automatic Static Optimization](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/rendering/automatic-static-optimization).**\n> *   A custom server **cannot** be deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/solutions/nextjs).\n> *   Standalone output mode, does not trace custom server files and this mode outputs a separate minimal `server.js` file instead.\n\nTake a look at the following example of a custom server:\n\n```\nconst { createServer } = require('http')\nconst { parse } = require('url')\nconst next = require('next')\n \nconst dev = process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'\nconst hostname = 'localhost'\nconst port = 3000\n// when using middleware `hostname` and `port` must be provided below\nconst app = next({ dev, hostname, port })\nconst handle = app.getRequestHandler()\n \napp.prepare().then(() => {\n  createServer(async (req, res) => {\n    try {\n      // Be sure to pass `true` as the second argument to `url.parse`.\n      // This tells it to parse the query portion of the URL.\n      const parsedUrl = parse(req.url, true)\n      const { pathname, query } = parsedUrl\n \n      if (pathname === '/a') {\n        await app.render(req, res, '/a', query)\n      } else if (pathname === '/b') {\n        await app.render(req, res, '/b', query)\n      } else {\n        await handle(req, res, parsedUrl)\n      }\n    } catch (err) {\n      console.error('Error occurred handling', req.url, err)\n      res.statusCode = 500\n      res.end('internal server error')\n    }\n  })\n    .once('error', (err) => {\n      console.error(err)\n      process.exit(1)\n    })\n    .listen(port, () => {\n      console.log(`> Ready on http://${hostname}:${port}`)\n    })\n})\n```\n\n> `server.js` doesn't go through babel or webpack. Make sure the syntax and sources this file requires are compatible with the current node version you are running.\n\nTo run the custom server you'll need to update the `scripts` in `package.json` like so:\n\n```\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"dev\": \"node server.js\",\n    \"build\": \"next build\",\n    \"start\": \"NODE_ENV=production node server.js\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n* * *\n\nThe custom server uses the following import to connect the server with the Next.js application:\n\n```\nconst next = require('next')\nconst app = next({})\n```\n\nThe above `next` import is a function that receives an object with the following options:\n\n| Option | Type | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `conf` | `Object` | The same object you would use in [next.config.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/next-config-js). Defaults to `{}` |\n| `customServer` | `Boolean` | (_Optional_) Set to false when the server was created by Next.js |\n| `dev` | `Boolean` | (_Optional_) Whether or not to launch Next.js in dev mode. Defaults to `false` |\n| `dir` | `String` | (_Optional_) Location of the Next.js project. Defaults to `'.'` |\n| `quiet` | `Boolean` | (_Optional_) Hide error messages containing server information. Defaults to `false` |\n| `hostname` | `String` | (_Optional_) The hostname the server is running behind |\n| `port` | `Number` | (_Optional_) The port the server is running behind |\n| `httpServer` | `node:http#Server` | (_Optional_) The HTTP Server that Next.js is running behind |\n\nThe returned `app` can then be used to let Next.js handle requests as required.\n\n## [Disabling file-system routing](#disabling-file-system-routing)\n\nBy default, `Next` will serve each file in the `pages` folder under a pathname matching the filename. If your project uses a custom server, this behavior may result in the same content being served from multiple paths, which can present problems with SEO and UX.\n\nTo disable this behavior and prevent routing based on files in `pages`, open `next.config.js` and disable the `useFileSystemPublicRoutes` config:\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  useFileSystemPublicRoutes: false,\n}\n```\n\n> Note that `useFileSystemPublicRoutes` disables filename routes from SSR; client-side routing may still access those paths. When using this option, you should guard against navigation to routes you do not want programmatically.\n\n> You may also wish to configure the client-side router to disallow client-side redirects to filename routes; for that refer to [`router.beforePopState`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/use-router#routerbeforepopstate).",

See [Next.js Compiler](https://nextjs.org/docs/architecture/nextjs-compiler) for more info.\n*   The `next/image` import was renamed to `next/legacy/image`. The `next/future/image` import was renamed to `next/image`. A [codemod is available](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/upgrading/codemods#next-image-to-legacy-image) to safely and automatically rename your imports.\n*   The `next/link` child can no longer be `<a>`. Add the `legacyBehavior` prop to use the legacy behavior or remove the `<a>` to upgrade. A [codemod is available](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/upgrading/codemods#new-link) to automatically upgrade your code.\n*   The `target` configuration property has been removed and superseded by [Output File Tracing](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/next-config-js/output).\n\nNext.js 13 introduces a new [`app` directory](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing) with new features and conventions. However, upgrading to Next.js 13 does **not** require using the new [`app` directory](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing#the-app-router).\n\nYou can continue using `pages` with new features that work in both directories, such as the updated [Image component](#image-component), [Link component](#link-component), [Script component](#script-component), and [Font optimization](#font-optimization).\n\n### [`<Image/>` Component](#image-component)\n\nNext.js 12 introduced many improvements to the Image Component with a temporary import: `next/future/image`. These improvements included less client-side JavaScript, easier ways to extend and style images, better accessibility, and native browser lazy loading.\n\nStarting in Next.js 13, this new behavior is now the default for `next/image`.\n\nThere are two codemods to help you migrate to the new Image Component:\n\n*   [next-image-to-legacy-image](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/upgrading/codemods#next-image-to-legacy-image): This codemod will safely and automatically rename `next/image` imports to `next/legacy/image` to maintain the same behavior as Next.js 12. We recommend running this codemod to quickly update to Next.js 13 automatically.\n*   [next-image-experimental](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/upgrading/codemods#next-image-experimental): After running the previous codemod, you can optionally run this experimental codemod to upgrade `next/legacy/image` to the new `next/image`, which will remove unused props and add inline styles. Please note this codemod is experimental and only covers static usage (such as `<Image src={img} layout=\"responsive\" />`) but not dynamic usage (such as `<Image {...props} />`).\n\nAlternatively, you can manually update by following the [migration guide](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/upgrading/codemods#next-image-experimental) and also see the [legacy comparison](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/components/image-legacy#comparison).\n\n### [`<Link>` Component](#link-component)\n\nThe [`<Link>` Component](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/components/link) no longer requires manually adding an `<a>` tag as a child. This behavior was added as an experimental option in [version 12.2](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-12-2) and is now the default. In Next.js 13, `<Link>` always renders `<a>` and allows you to forward props to the underlying tag.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n \n// Next.js 12: `<a>` has to be nested otherwise it's excluded\n<Link href=\"/about\">\n  <a>About</a>\n</Link>\n \n// Next.js 13: `<Link>` always renders `<a>` under the hood\n<Link href=\"/about\">\n  About\n</Link>\n```\n\nTo upgrade your links to Next.js 13, you can use the [`new-link` codemod](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/upgrading/codemods#new-link).\n\n### [`<Script>` Component](#script-component)\n\nThe behavior of [`next/script`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/components/script) has been updated to support both `pages` and `app`. If incrementally adopting `app`, read the [upgrade guide](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/upgrading).\n\n### [Font Optimization](#font-optimization)\n\nPreviously, Next.js helped you optimize fonts by inlining font CSS. Version 13 introduces the new [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) module which gives you the ability to customize your font loading experience while still ensuring great performance and privacy.\n\nSee [Optimizing Fonts](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to learn how to use `next/font`.",

    "markdown": "# Configuring: Draft Mode | Next.js\n\nIn the [Pages documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts) and the [Data Fetching documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching), we talked about how to pre-render a page at build time (**Static Generation**) using `getStaticProps` and `getStaticPaths`.\n\nStatic Generation is useful when your pages fetch data from a headless CMS. However, it’s not ideal when you’re writing a draft on your headless CMS and want to view the draft immediately on your page. You’d want Next.js to render these pages at **request time** instead of build time and fetch the draft content instead of the published content. You’d want Next.js to bypass Static Generation only for this specific case.\n\nNext.js has a feature called **Draft Mode** which solves this problem. Here are instructions on how to use it.\n\n## [Step 1: Create and access the API route](#step-1-create-and-access-the-api-route)\n\n> Take a look at the [API Routes documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) first if you’re not familiar with Next.js API Routes.\n\nFirst, create the **API route**. It can have any name - e.g. `pages/api/draft.ts`\n\nIn this API route, you need to call `setDraftMode` on the response object.\n\n```\nexport default function handler(req, res) {\n  // ...\n  res.setDraftMode({ enable: true })\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\nThis will set a **cookie** to enable draft mode. Subsequent requests containing this cookie will trigger **Draft Mode** changing the behavior for statically generated pages (more on this later).\n\nYou can test this manually by creating an API route like below and accessing it from your browser manually:\n\n```\n// simple example for testing it manually from your browser.\nexport default function handler(req, res) {\n  res.setDraftMode({ enable: true })\n  res.end('Draft mode is enabled')\n}\n```\n\nIf you open your browser’s developer tools and visit `/api/draft`, you’ll notice a `Set-Cookie` response header with a cookie named `__prerender_bypass`.\n\n### [Securely accessing it from your Headless CMS](#securely-accessing-it-from-your-headless-cms)\n\nIn practice, you’d want to call this API route _securely_ from your headless CMS. The specific steps will vary depending on which headless CMS you’re using, but here are some common steps you could take.\n\nThese steps assume that the headless CMS you’re using supports setting **custom draft URLs**. If it doesn’t, you can still use this method to secure your draft URLs, but you’ll need to construct and access the draft URL manually.\n\n**First**, you should create a **secret token string** using a token generator of your choice. This secret will only be known by your Next.js app and your headless CMS. This secret prevents people who don’t have access to your CMS from accessing draft URLs.\n\n**Second**, if your headless CMS supports setting custom draft URLs, specify the following as the draft URL. This assumes that your draft API route is located at `pages/api/draft.ts`.\n\n```\nhttps://<your-site>/api/draft?secret=<token>&slug=<path>\n```\n\n*   `<your-site>` should be your deployment domain.\n*   `<token>` should be replaced with the secret token you generated.\n*   `<path>` should be the path for the page that you want to view. If you want to view `/posts/foo`, then you should use `&slug=/posts/foo`.\n\nYour headless CMS might allow you to include a variable in the draft URL so that `<path>` can be set dynamically based on the CMS’s data like so: `&slug=/posts/{entry.fields.slug}`\n\n**Finally**, in the draft API route:\n\n*   Check that the secret matches and that the `slug` parameter exists (if not, the request should fail).\n\n*   Call `res.setDraftMode`.\n*   Then redirect the browser to the path specified by `slug`. (The following example uses a [307 redirect](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/307)).\n\n```\nexport default async (req, res) => {\n  // Check the secret and next parameters\n  // This secret should only be known to this API route and the CMS\n  if (req.query.secret !== 'MY_SECRET_TOKEN' || !req.query.slug) {\n    return res.status(401).json({ message: 'Invalid token' })\n  }\n \n  // Fetch the headless CMS to check if the provided `slug` exists\n  // getPostBySlug would implement the required fetching logic to the headless CMS\n  const post = await getPostBySlug(req.query.slug)\n \n  // If the slug doesn't exist prevent draft mode from being enabled\n  if (!post) {\n    return res.status(401).json({ message: 'Invalid slug' })\n  }\n \n  // Enable Draft Mode by setting the cookie\n  res.setDraftMode({ enable: true })\n \n  // Redirect to the path from the fetched post\n  // We don't redirect to req.query.slug as that might lead to open redirect vulnerabilities\n  res.redirect(post.slug)\n}\n```\n\nIf it succeeds, then the browser will be redirected to the path you want to view with the draft mode cookie.\n\n## [Step 2: Update `getStaticProps`](#step-2-update-getstaticprops)\n\nThe next step is to update `getStaticProps` to support draft mode.\n\nIf you request a page which has `getStaticProps` with the cookie set (via `res.setDraftMode`), then `getStaticProps` will be called at **request time** (instead of at build time).\n\nFurthermore, it will be called with a `context` object where `context.draftMode` will be `true`.\n\n```\nexport async function getStaticProps(context) {\n  if (context.draftMode) {\n    // dynamic data\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWe used `res.setDraftMode` in the draft API route, so `context.draftMode` will be `true`.\n\nIf you’re also using `getStaticPaths`, then `context.params` will also be available.\n\n### [Fetch draft data](#fetch-draft-data)\n\nYou can update `getStaticProps` to fetch different data based on `context.draftMode`.\n\nFor example, your headless CMS might have a different API endpoint for draft posts. If so, you can modify the API endpoint URL like below:\n\n```\nexport async function getStaticProps(context) {\n  const url = context.draftMode\n    ? 'https://draft.example.com'\n    : 'https://production.example.com'\n  const res = await fetch(url)\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\nThat’s it! If you access the draft API route (with `secret` and `slug`) from your headless CMS or manually, you should now be able to see the draft content. And if you update your draft without publishing, you should be able to view the draft.\n\nSet this as the draft URL on your headless CMS or access manually, and you should be able to see the draft.\n\n```\nhttps://<your-site>/api/draft?secret=<token>&slug=<path>\n```\n\n## [More Details](#more-details)\n\n### [Clear the Draft Mode cookie](#clear-the-draft-mode-cookie)\n\nBy default, the Draft Mode session ends when the browser is closed.\n\nTo clear the Draft Mode cookie manually, create an API route that calls `setDraftMode({ enable: false })`:\n\n```\nexport default function handler(req, res) {\n  res.setDraftMode({ enable: false })\n}\n```\n\nThen, send a request to `/api/disable-draft` to invoke the API Route. If calling this route using [`next/link`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/components/link), you must pass `prefetch={false}` to prevent accidentally deleting the cookie on prefetch.\n\n### [Works with `getServerSideProps`](#works-with-getserversideprops)\n\nDraft Mode works with `getServerSideProps`, and is available as a `draftMode` key in the [`context`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/get-server-side-props#context-parameter) object.\n\n> **Good to know**: You shouldn't set the `Cache-Control` header when using Draft Mode because it cannot be bypassed. Instead, we recommend using [ISR](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/incremental-static-regeneration).\n\n### [Works with API Routes](#works-with-api-routes)\n\nAPI Routes will have access to `draftMode` on the request object. For example:\n\n```\nexport default function myApiRoute(req, res) {\n  if (req.draftMode) {\n    // get draft data\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### [Unique per `next build`](#unique-per-next-build)\n\nA new bypass cookie value will be generated each time you run `next build`.\n\nThis ensures that the bypass cookie can’t be guessed.\n\n> **Good to know**: To test Draft Mode locally over HTTP, your browser will need to allow third-party cookies and local storage access.",

To upgrade you can run the following command in the terminal:\n\n```\nnpm install react@latest react-dom@latest\n \nyarn add react@latest react-dom@latest\n \npnpm update react@latest react-dom@latest\n \nbun add react@latest react-dom@latest\n```\n\n#### [SWC replacing Babel](#swc-replacing-babel)\n\nNext.js now uses the Rust-based compiler [SWC](https://swc.rs/) to compile JavaScript/TypeScript. This new compiler is up to 17x faster than Babel when compiling individual files and up to 5x faster Fast Refresh.\n\nNext.js provides full backward compatibility with applications that have [custom Babel configuration](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/babel). All transformations that Next.js handles by default like styled-jsx and tree-shaking of `getStaticProps` / `getStaticPaths` / `getServerSideProps` have been ported to Rust.\n\nWhen an application has a custom Babel configuration, Next.js will automatically opt-out of using SWC for compiling JavaScript/Typescript and will fall back to using Babel in the same way that it was used in Next.js 11.\n\nMany of the integrations with external libraries that currently require custom Babel transformations will be ported to Rust-based SWC transforms in the near future. These include but are not limited to:\n\n*   Styled Components\n*   Emotion\n*   Relay\n\nIn order to prioritize transforms that will help you adopt SWC, please provide your `.babelrc` on [this feedback thread](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/30174).\n\n#### [SWC replacing Terser for minification](#swc-replacing-terser-for-minification)\n\nYou can opt-in to replacing Terser with SWC for minifying JavaScript up to 7x faster using a flag in `next.config.js`:\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  swcMinify: true,\n}\n```\n\nMinification using SWC is an opt-in flag to ensure it can be tested against more real-world Next.js applications before it becomes the default in Next.js 12.1. If you have feedback about minification, please leave it on [this feedback thread](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/30237).\n\n#### [Improvements to styled-jsx CSS parsing](#improvements-to-styled-jsx-css-parsing)\n\nOn top of the Rust-based compiler we've implemented a new CSS parser based on the one used for the styled-jsx Babel transform. This new parser has improved handling of CSS and now errors when invalid CSS is used that would previously slip through and cause unexpected behavior.\n\nBecause of this change invalid CSS will throw an error during development and `next build`. This change only affects styled-jsx usage.\n\n#### [`next/image` changed wrapping element](#nextimage-changed-wrapping-element)\n\n`next/image` now renders the `<img>` inside a `<span>` instead of `<div>`.\n\nIf your application has specific CSS targeting span such as `.container span`, upgrading to Next.js 12 might incorrectly match the wrapping element inside the `<Image>` component. You can avoid this by restricting the selector to a specific class such as `.container span.item` and updating the relevant component with that className, such as `<span className=\"item\" />`.\n\nIf your application has specific CSS targeting the `next/image` `<div>` tag, for example `.container div`, it may not match anymore. You can update the selector `.container span`, or preferably, add a new `<div className=\"wrapper\">` wrapping the `<Image>` component and target that instead such as `.container .wrapper`.\n\nThe `className` prop is unchanged and will still be passed to the underlying `<img>` element.\n\nSee the [documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/images#styling) for more info.\n\n#### [HMR connection now uses a WebSocket](#hmr-connection-now-uses-a-websocket)\n\nPreviously, Next.js used a [server-sent events](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events) connection to receive HMR events. Next.js 12 now uses a WebSocket connection.\n\nIn some cases when proxying requests to the Next.js dev server, you will need to ensure the upgrade request is handled correctly. For example, in `nginx` you would need to add the following configuration:\n\n```\nlocation /_next/webpack-hmr {\n    proxy_pass http://localhost:3000/_next/webpack-hmr;\n    proxy_http_version 1.1;\n    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;\n    proxy_set_header Connection \"upgrade\";\n}\n```\n\nIf you are using Apache (2.x), you can add the following configuration to enable web sockets to the server. Review the port, host name and server names.\n\n```\n<VirtualHost *:443>\n # ServerName yourwebsite.local\n ServerName \"${WEBSITE_SERVER_NAME}\"\n ProxyPass / http://localhost:3000/\n ProxyPassReverse / http://localhost:3000/\n # Next.js 12 uses websocket\n <Location /_next/webpack-hmr>\n    RewriteEngine On\n    RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} transport=websocket [NC]\n    RewriteCond %{HTTP:Upgrade} websocket [NC]\n    RewriteCond %{HTTP:Connection} upgrade [NC]\n    RewriteRule /(.*) ws://localhost:3000/_next/webpack-hmr/$1 [P,L]\n    ProxyPass ws://localhost:3000/_next/webpack-hmr retry=0 timeout=30\n    ProxyPassReverse ws://localhost:3000/_next/webpack-hmr\n </Location>\n</VirtualHost>\n```\n\nFor custom servers, such as `express`, you may need to use `app.all` to ensure the request is passed correctly, for example:\n\n```\napp.all('/_next/webpack-hmr', (req, res) => {\n  nextjsRequestHandler(req, res)\n})\n```\n\n#### [Webpack 4 support has been removed](#webpack-4-support-has-been-removed)\n\nIf you are already using webpack 5 you can skip this section.\n\nNext.js has adopted webpack 5 as the default for compilation in Next.js 11. As communicated in the [webpack 5 upgrading documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/webpack5) Next.js 12 removes support for webpack 4.\n\nIf your application is still using webpack 4 using the opt-out flag, you will now see an error linking to the [webpack 5 upgrading documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/webpack5).\n\n#### [`target` option deprecated](#target-option-deprecated)\n\nIf you do not have `target` in `next.config.js` you can skip this section.\n\nThe target option has been deprecated in favor of built-in support for tracing what dependencies are needed to run a page.\n\nDuring `next build`, Next.js will automatically trace each page and its dependencies to determine all of the files that are needed for deploying a production version of your application.\n\nIf you are currently using the `target` option set to `serverless`, please read the [documentation on how to leverage the new output](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/next-config-js/output).",

    "markdown": "# Configuring: Error Handling | Next.js\n\nThis documentation explains how you can handle development, server-side, and client-side errors.\n\n## [Handling Errors in Development](#handling-errors-in-development)\n\nWhen there is a runtime error during the development phase of your Next.js application, you will encounter an **overlay**. It is a modal that covers the webpage. It is **only** visible when the development server runs using `next dev` via `pnpm dev`, `npm run dev`, `yarn dev`, or `bun dev` and will not be shown in production. Fixing the error will automatically dismiss the overlay.\n\nHere is an example of an overlay:\n\n![Example of an overlay when in development mode](https://assets.vercel.com/image/upload/v1645118290/docs-assets/static/docs/error-handling/overlay.png)\n\n## [Handling Server Errors](#handling-server-errors)\n\nNext.js provides a static 500 page by default to handle server-side errors that occur in your application. You can also [customize this page](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/custom-error#customizing-the-500-page) by creating a `pages/500.js` file.\n\nHaving a 500 page in your application does not show specific errors to the app user.\n\nYou can also use [404 page](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/custom-error#404-page) to handle specific runtime error like `file not found`.\n\n## [Handling Client Errors](#handling-client-errors)\n\nReact [Error Boundaries](https://react.dev/reference/react/Component#catching-rendering-errors-with-an-error-boundary) is a graceful way to handle a JavaScript error on the client so that the other parts of the application continue working. In addition to preventing the page from crashing, it allows you to provide a custom fallback component and even log error information.\n\nTo use Error Boundaries for your Next.js application, you must create a class component `ErrorBoundary` and wrap the `Component` prop in the `pages/_app.js` file. This component will be responsible to:\n\n*   Render a fallback UI after an error is thrown\n*   Provide a way to reset the Application's state\n*   Log error information\n\nYou can create an `ErrorBoundary` class component by extending `React.Component`. For example:\n\n```\nclass ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props)\n \n    // Define a state variable to track whether is an error or not\n    this.state = { hasError: false }\n  }\n  static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {\n    // Update state so the next render will show the fallback UI\n \n    return { hasError: true }\n  }\n  componentDidCatch(error, errorInfo) {\n    // You can use your own error logging service here\n    console.log({ error, errorInfo })\n  }\n  render() {\n    // Check if the error is thrown\n    if (this.state.hasError) {\n      // You can render any custom fallback UI\n      return (\n        <div>\n          <h2>Oops, there is an error!</h2>\n          <button\n            type=\"button\"\n            onClick={() => this.setState({ hasError: false })}\n          >\n            Try again?\n          </button>\n        </div>\n      )\n    }\n \n    // Return children components in case of no error\n \n    return this.props.children\n  }\n}\n \nexport default ErrorBoundary\n```\n\nThe `ErrorBoundary` component keeps track of an `hasError` state. The value of this state variable is a boolean. When the value of `hasError` is `true`, then the `ErrorBoundary` component will render a fallback UI. Otherwise, it will render the children components.\n\nAfter creating an `ErrorBoundary` component, import it in the `pages/_app.js` file to wrap the `Component` prop in your Next.js application.\n\n```\n// Import the ErrorBoundary component\nimport ErrorBoundary from '../components/ErrorBoundary'\n \nfunction MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {\n  return (\n    // Wrap the Component prop with ErrorBoundary component\n    <ErrorBoundary>\n      <Component {...pageProps} />\n    </ErrorBoundary>\n  )\n}\n \nexport default MyApp\n```\n\nYou can learn more about [Error Boundaries](https://react.dev/reference/react/Component#catching-rendering-errors-with-an-error-boundary) in React's documentation.\n\n### [Reporting Errors](#reporting-errors)\n\nTo monitor client errors, use a service like [Sentry](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-sentry), Bugsnag or Datadog.",

    "markdown": "# next.config.js Options: headers | Next.js\n\nHeaders allow you to set custom HTTP headers on the response to an incoming request on a given path.\n\nTo set custom HTTP headers you can use the `headers` key in `next.config.js`:\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  async headers() {\n    return [\n      {\n        source: '/about',\n        headers: [\n          {\n            key: 'x-custom-header',\n            value: 'my custom header value',\n          },\n          {\n            key: 'x-another-custom-header',\n            value: 'my other custom header value',\n          },\n        ],\n      },\n    ]\n  },\n}\n```\n\n`headers` is an async function that expects an array to be returned holding objects with `source` and `headers` properties:\n\n*   `source` is the incoming request path pattern.\n*   `headers` is an array of response header objects, with `key` and `value` properties.\n*   `basePath`: `false` or `undefined` - if false the basePath won't be included when matching, can be used for external rewrites only.\n*   `locale`: `false` or `undefined` - whether the locale should not be included when matching.\n*   `has` is an array of [has objects](#header-cookie-and-query-matching) with the `type`, `key` and `value` properties.\n*   `missing` is an array of [missing objects](#header-cookie-and-query-matching) with the `type`, `key` and `value` properties.\n\nHeaders are checked before the filesystem which includes pages and `/public` files.\n\nIf two headers match the same path and set the same header key, the last header key will override the first. Using the below headers, the path `/hello` will result in the header `x-hello` being `world` due to the last header value set being `world`.\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  async headers() {\n    return [\n      {\n        source: '/:path*',\n        headers: [\n          {\n            key: 'x-hello',\n            value: 'there',\n          },\n        ],\n      },\n      {\n        source: '/hello',\n        headers: [\n          {\n            key: 'x-hello',\n            value: 'world',\n          },\n        ],\n      },\n    ]\n  },\n}\n```\n\n## [Path Matching](#path-matching)\n\nPath matches are allowed, for example `/blog/:slug` will match `/blog/hello-world` (no nested paths):\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  async headers() {\n    return [\n      {\n        source: '/blog/:slug',\n        headers: [\n          {\n            key: 'x-slug',\n            value: ':slug', // Matched parameters can be used in the value\n          },\n          {\n            key: 'x-slug-:slug', // Matched parameters can be used in the key\n            value: 'my other custom header value',\n          },\n        ],\n      },\n    ]\n  },\n}\n```\n\n### [Wildcard Path Matching](#wildcard-path-matching)\n\nTo match a wildcard path you can use `*` after a parameter, for example `/blog/:slug*` will match `/blog/a/b/c/d/hello-world`:\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  async headers() {\n    return [\n      {\n        source: '/blog/:slug*',\n        headers: [\n          {\n            key: 'x-slug',\n            value: ':slug*', // Matched parameters can be used in the value\n          },\n          {\n            key: 'x-slug-:slug*', // Matched parameters can be used in the key\n            value: 'my other custom header value',\n          },\n        ],\n      },\n    ]\n  },\n}\n```\n\n### [Regex Path Matching](#regex-path-matching)\n\nTo match a regex path you can wrap the regex in parenthesis after a parameter, for example `/blog/:slug(\\\\d{1,})` will match `/blog/123` but not `/blog/abc`:\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  async headers() {\n    return [\n      {\n        source: '/blog/:post(\\\\d{1,})',\n        headers: [\n          {\n            key: 'x-post',\n            value: ':post',\n          },\n        ],\n      },\n    ]\n  },\n}\n```\n\nThe following characters `(`, `)`, `{`, `}`, `:`, `*`, `+`, `?` are used for regex path matching, so when used in the `source` as non-special values they must be escaped by adding `\\\\` before them:\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  async headers() {\n    return [\n      {\n        // this will match `/english(default)/something` being requested\n        source: '/english\\\\(default\\\\)/:slug',\n        headers: [\n          {\n            key: 'x-header',\n            value: 'value',\n          },\n        ],\n      },\n    ]\n  },\n}\n```\n\n## [Header, Cookie, and Query Matching](#header-cookie-and-query-matching)\n\nTo only apply a header when header, cookie, or query values also match the `has` field or don't match the `missing` field can be used. Both the `source` and all `has` items must match and all `missing` items must not match for the header to be applied.\n\n`has` and `missing` items can have the following fields:\n\n*   `type`: `String` - must be either `header`, `cookie`, `host`, or `query`.\n*   `key`: `String` - the key from the selected type to match against.\n*   `value`: `String` or `undefined` - the value to check for, if undefined any value will match. A regex like string can be used to capture a specific part of the value, e.g. if the value `first-(?<paramName>.*)` is used for `first-second` then `second` will be usable in the destination with `:paramName`.\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  async headers() {\n    return [\n      // if the header `x-add-header` is present,\n      // the `x-another-header` header will be applied\n      {\n        source: '/:path*',\n        has: [\n          {\n            type: 'header',\n            key: 'x-add-header',\n          },\n        ],\n        headers: [\n          {\n            key: 'x-another-header',\n            value: 'hello',\n          },\n        ],\n      },\n      // if the header `x-no-header` is not present,\n      // the `x-another-header` header will be applied\n      {\n        source: '/:path*',\n        missing: [\n          {\n            type: 'header',\n            key: 'x-no-header',\n          },\n        ],\n        headers: [\n          {\n            key: 'x-another-header',\n            value: 'hello',\n          },\n        ],\n      },\n      // if the source, query, and cookie are matched,\n      // the `x-authorized` header will be applied\n      {\n        source: '/specific/:path*',\n        has: [\n          {\n            type: 'query',\n            key: 'page',\n            // the page value will not be available in the\n            // header key/values since value is provided and\n            // doesn't use a named capture group e.g. (?<page>home)\n            value: 'home',\n          },\n          {\n            type: 'cookie',\n            key: 'authorized',\n            value: 'true',\n          },\n        ],\n        headers: [\n          {\n            key: 'x-authorized',\n            value: ':authorized',\n          },\n        ],\n      },\n      // if the header `x-authorized` is present and\n      // contains a matching value, the `x-another-header` will be applied\n      {\n        source: '/:path*',\n        has: [\n          {\n            type: 'header',\n            key: 'x-authorized',\n            value: '(?<authorized>yes|true)',\n          },\n        ],\n        headers: [\n          {\n            key: 'x-another-header',\n            value: ':authorized',\n          },\n        ],\n      },\n      // if the host is `example.com`,\n      // this header will be applied\n      {\n        source: '/:path*',\n        has: [\n          {\n            type: 'host',\n            value: 'example.com',\n          },\n        ],\n        headers: [\n          {\n            key: 'x-another-header',\n            value: ':authorized',\n          },\n        ],\n      },\n    ]\n  },\n}\n```\n\nWhen leveraging [`basePath` support](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/basePath) with headers each `source` is automatically prefixed with the `basePath` unless you add `basePath: false` to the header:\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  basePath: '/docs',\n \n  async headers() {\n    return [\n      {\n        source: '/with-basePath', // becomes /docs/with-basePath\n        headers: [\n          {\n            key: 'x-hello',\n            value: 'world',\n          },\n        ],\n      },\n      {\n        source: '/without-basePath', // is not modified since basePath: false is set\n        headers: [\n          {\n            key: 'x-hello',\n            value: 'world',\n          },\n        ],\n        basePath: false,\n      },\n    ]\n  },\n}\n```\n\nWhen leveraging [`i18n` support](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/internationalization) with headers each `source` is automatically prefixed to handle the configured `locales` unless you add `locale: false` to the header. If `locale: false` is used you must prefix the `source` with a locale for it to be matched correctly.\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  i18n: {\n    locales: ['en', 'fr', 'de'],\n    defaultLocale: 'en',\n  },\n \n  async headers() {\n    return [\n      {\n        source: '/with-locale', // automatically handles all locales\n        headers: [\n          {\n            key: 'x-hello',\n            value: 'world',\n          },\n        ],\n      },\n      {\n        // does not handle locales automatically since locale: false is set\n        source: '/nl/with-locale-manual',\n        locale: false,\n        headers: [\n          {\n            key: 'x-hello',\n            value: 'world',\n          },\n        ],\n      },\n      {\n        // this matches '/' since `en` is the defaultLocale\n        source: '/en',\n        locale: false,\n        headers: [\n          {\n            key: 'x-hello',\n            value: 'world',\n          },\n        ],\n      },\n      {\n        // this gets converted to /(en|fr|de)/(.*) so will not match the top-level\n        // `/` or `/fr` routes like /:path* would\n        source: '/(.*)',\n        headers: [\n          {\n            key: 'x-hello',\n            value: 'world',\n          },\n        ],\n      },\n    ]\n  },\n}\n```\n\n## [Cache-Control](#cache-control)\n\nYou cannot set `Cache-Control` headers in `next.config.js` for pages or assets, as these headers will be overwritten in production to ensure that responses and static assets are cached effectively.\n\nIf you need to revalidate the cache of a page that has been [statically generated](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/rendering/static-site-generation), you can do so by setting the `revalidate` prop in the page's [`getStaticProps`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-static-props) function.\n\nYou can set the `Cache-Control` header in your [API Routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) by using the `res.setHeader` method:\n\n```\nimport type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next'\n \ntype ResponseData = {\n  message: string\n}\n \nexport default function handler(\n  req: NextApiRequest,\n  res: NextApiResponse<ResponseData>\n) {\n  res.setHeader('Cache-Control', 's-maxage=86400')\n  res.status(200).json({ message: 'Hello from Next.js!' })\n}\n```\n\n## [Options](#options)\n\n### [CORS](#cors)\n\n[Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) is a security feature that allows you to control which sites can access your resources. You can set the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header to allow a specific origin to access your API Endpoints.\n\n```\nasync headers() {\n    return [\n      {\n        source: \"/api/:path*\",\n        headers: [\n          {\n            key: \"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\",\n            value: \"*\", // Set your origin\n          },\n          {\n            key: \"Access-Control-Allow-Methods\",\n            value: \"GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS\",\n          },\n          {\n            key: \"Access-Control-Allow-Headers\",\n            value: \"Content-Type, Authorization\",\n          },\n        ],\n      },\n    ];\n  },\n```\n\n### [X-DNS-Prefetch-Control](#x-dns-prefetch-control)\n\n[This header](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-DNS-Prefetch-Control) controls DNS prefetching, allowing browsers to proactively perform domain name resolution on external links, images, CSS, JavaScript, and more. This prefetching is performed in the background, so the [DNS](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Glossary/DNS) is more likely to be resolved by the time the referenced items are needed. This reduces latency when the user clicks a link.\n\n```\n{\n  key: 'X-DNS-Prefetch-Control',\n  value: 'on'\n}\n```\n\n### [Strict-Transport-Security](#strict-transport-security)\n\n[This header](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security) informs browsers it should only be accessed using HTTPS, instead of using HTTP. Using the configuration below, all present and future subdomains will use HTTPS for a `max-age` of 2 years. This blocks access to pages or subdomains that can only be served over HTTP.\n\nIf you're deploying to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/edge-network/headers#strict-transport-security?utm_source=next-site&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=next-website), this header is not necessary as it's automatically added to all deployments unless you declare `headers` in your `next.config.js`.\n\n```\n{\n  key: 'Strict-Transport-Security',\n  value: 'max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload'\n}\n```\n\n### [X-Frame-Options](#x-frame-options)\n\n[This header](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Frame-Options) indicates whether the site should be allowed to be displayed within an `iframe`. This can prevent against clickjacking attacks.\n\n**This header has been superseded by CSP's `frame-ancestors` option**, which has better support in modern browsers (see [Content Security Policy](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/content-security-policy) for configuration details).\n\n```\n{\n  key: 'X-Frame-Options',\n  value: 'SAMEORIGIN'\n}\n```\n\n### [Permissions-Policy](#permissions-policy)\n\n[This header](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Permissions-Policy) allows you to control which features and APIs can be used in the browser. It was previously named `Feature-Policy`.\n\n```\n{\n  key: 'Permissions-Policy',\n  value: 'camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=(), browsing-topics=()'\n}\n```\n\n### [X-Content-Type-Options](#x-content-type-options)\n\n[This header](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Content-Type-Options) prevents the browser from attempting to guess the type of content if the `Content-Type` header is not explicitly set. This can prevent XSS exploits for websites that allow users to upload and share files.\n\nFor example, a user trying to download an image, but having it treated as a different `Content-Type` like an executable, which could be malicious. This header also applies to downloading browser extensions. The only valid value for this header is `nosniff`.\n\n```\n{\n  key: 'X-Content-Type-Options',\n  value: 'nosniff'\n}\n```\n\n### [Referrer-Policy](#referrer-policy)\n\n[This header](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Referrer-Policy) controls how much information the browser includes when navigating from the current website (origin) to another.\n\n```\n{\n  key: 'Referrer-Policy',\n  value: 'origin-when-cross-origin'\n}\n```\n\n### [Content-Security-Policy](#content-security-policy)\n\nLearn more about adding a [Content Security Policy](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/content-security-policy) to your application.\n\n## [Version History](#version-history)\n\n| Version | Changes |\n| --- | --- |\n| `v13.3.0` | `missing` added. |\n| `v10.2.0` | `has` added. |\n| `v9.5.0` | Headers added. |",

    "markdown": "# Configuring: Debugging | Next.js\n\nThis documentation explains how you can debug your Next.js frontend and backend code with full source maps support using either the [VS Code debugger](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging) or [Chrome DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools).\n\nAny debugger that can attach to Node.js can also be used to debug a Next.js application. You can find more details in the Node.js [Debugging Guide](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/debugging-getting-started/).\n\n## [Debugging with VS Code](#debugging-with-vs-code)\n\nCreate a file named `.vscode/launch.json` at the root of your project with the following content:\n\n```\n{\n  \"version\": \"0.2.0\",\n  \"configurations\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Next.js: debug server-side\",\n      \"type\": \"node-terminal\",\n      \"request\": \"launch\",\n      \"command\": \"npm run dev\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Next.js: debug client-side\",\n      \"type\": \"chrome\",\n      \"request\": \"launch\",\n      \"url\": \"http://localhost:3000\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Next.js: debug full stack\",\n      \"type\": \"node-terminal\",\n      \"request\": \"launch\",\n      \"command\": \"npm run dev\",\n      \"serverReadyAction\": {\n        \"pattern\": \"- Local:.+(https?://.+)\",\n        \"uriFormat\": \"%s\",\n        \"action\": \"debugWithChrome\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n`npm run dev` can be replaced with `yarn dev` if you're using Yarn or `pnpm dev` if you're using pnpm.\n\nIf you're [changing the port number](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/next-cli#development) your application starts on, replace the `3000` in `http://localhost:3000` with the port you're using instead.\n\nIf you're running Next.js from a directory other than root (for example, if you're using Turborepo) then you need to add `cwd` to the server-side and full stack debugging tasks. For example, `\"cwd\": \"${workspaceFolder}/apps/web\"`.\n\nNow go to the Debug panel (`Ctrl+Shift+D` on Windows/Linux, `⇧+⌘+D` on macOS), select a launch configuration, then press `F5` or select **Debug: Start Debugging** from the Command Palette to start your debugging session.\n\n## [Using the Debugger in Jetbrains WebStorm](#using-the-debugger-in-jetbrains-webstorm)\n\nClick the drop down menu listing the runtime configuration, and click `Edit Configurations...`. Create a `Javascript Debug` debug configuration with `http://localhost:3000` as the URL. Customize to your liking (e.g. Browser for debugging, store as project file), and click `OK`. Run this debug configuration, and the selected browser should automatically open. At this point, you should have 2 applications in debug mode: the NextJS node application, and the client/ browser application.\n\n### [Client-side code](#client-side-code)\n\nStart your development server as usual by running `next dev`, `npm run dev`, or `yarn dev`. Once the server starts, open `http://localhost:3000` (or your alternate URL) in Chrome. Next, open Chrome's Developer Tools (`Ctrl+Shift+J` on Windows/Linux, `⌥+⌘+I` on macOS), then go to the **Sources** tab.\n\nNow, any time your client-side code reaches a [`debugger`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/debugger) statement, code execution will pause and that file will appear in the debug area. You can also press `Ctrl+P` on Windows/Linux or `⌘+P` on macOS to search for a file and set breakpoints manually. Note that when searching here, your source files will have paths starting with `webpack://_N_E/./`.\n\n### [Server-side code](#server-side-code)\n\nTo debug server-side Next.js code with Chrome DevTools, you need to pass the [`--inspect`](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#cli_inspect_host_port) flag to the underlying Node.js process:\n\n```\nNODE_OPTIONS='--inspect' next dev\n```\n\nIf you're using `npm run dev` or `yarn dev` then you should update the `dev` script on your `package.json`:\n\n```\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"dev\": \"NODE_OPTIONS='--inspect' next dev\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nLaunching the Next.js dev server with the `--inspect` flag will look something like this:\n\n```\nDebugger listening on ws://127.0.0.1:9229/0cf90313-350d-4466-a748-cd60f4e47c95\nFor help, see: https://nodejs.org/en/docs/inspector\nready - started server on 0.0.0.0:3000, url: http://localhost:3000\n```\n\n> Be aware that running `NODE_OPTIONS='--inspect' npm run dev` or `NODE_OPTIONS='--inspect' yarn dev` won't work. This would try to start multiple debuggers on the same port: one for the npm/yarn process and one for Next.js. You would then get an error like `Starting inspector on 127.0.0.1:9229 failed: address already in use` in your console.\n\nOnce the server starts, open a new tab in Chrome and visit `chrome://inspect`, where you should see your Next.js application inside the **Remote Target** section. Click **inspect** under your application to open a separate DevTools window, then go to the **Sources** tab.\n\nDebugging server-side code here works much like debugging client-side code with Chrome DevTools, except that when you search for files here with `Ctrl+P` or `⌘+P`, your source files will have paths starting with `webpack://{application-name}/./` (where `{application-name}` will be replaced with the name of your application according to your `package.json` file).\n\n### [Debugging on Windows](#debugging-on-windows)\n\nWindows users may run into an issue when using `NODE_OPTIONS='--inspect'` as that syntax is not supported on Windows platforms. To get around this, install the [`cross-env`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cross-env) package as a development dependency (`-D` with `npm` and `yarn`) and replace the `dev` script with the following.\n\n```\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"dev\": \"cross-env NODE_OPTIONS='--inspect' next dev\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n`cross-env` will set the `NODE_OPTIONS` environment variable regardless of which platform you are on (including Mac, Linux, and Windows) and allow you to debug consistently across devices and operating systems.\n\n> **Good to know**: Ensure Windows Defender is disabled on your machine. This external service will check _every file read_, which has been reported to greatly increase Fast Refresh time with `next dev`. This is a known issue, not related to Next.js, but it does affect Next.js development.\n\n## [More information](#more-information)\n\nTo learn more about how to use a JavaScript debugger, take a look at the following documentation:\n\n*   [Node.js debugging in VS Code: Breakpoints](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/nodejs-debugging#_breakpoints)\n*   [Chrome DevTools: Debug JavaScript](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/javascript)",

    "url": "https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/upgrading/version-11",
    "markdown": "# Upgrading: Version 11 | Next.js\n\nTo upgrade to version 11, run the following command:\n\n```\nnpm i next@11 react@17 react-dom@17\n```\n\n```\nyarn add next@11 react@17 react-dom@17\n```\n\n```\npnpm up next@11 react@17 react-dom@17\n```\n\n```\nbun add next@11 react@17 react-dom@17\n```\n\n> **Good to know:** If you are using TypeScript, ensure you also upgrade `@types/react` and `@types/react-dom` to their corresponding versions.\n\n### [Webpack 5](#webpack-5)\n\nWebpack 5 is now the default for all Next.js applications. If you did not have a custom webpack configuration, your application is already using webpack 5. If you do have a custom webpack configuration, you can refer to the [Next.js webpack 5 documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/webpack5) for upgrade guidance.\n\n### [Cleaning the `distDir` is now a default](#cleaning-the-distdir-is-now-a-default)\n\nThe build output directory (defaults to `.next`) is now cleared by default except for the Next.js caches. You can refer to [the cleaning `distDir` RFC](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/6009) for more information.\n\nIf your application was relying on this behavior previously you can disable the new default behavior by adding the `cleanDistDir: false` flag in `next.config.js`.\n\n### [`PORT` is now supported for `next dev` and `next start`](#port-is-now-supported-for-next-dev-and-next-start)\n\nNext.js 11 supports the `PORT` environment variable to set the port the application runs on. Using `-p`/`--port` is still recommended but if you were prohibited from using `-p` in any way you can now use `PORT` as an alternative:\n\nExample:\n\n### [`next.config.js` customization to import images](#nextconfigjs-customization-to-import-images)\n\nNext.js 11 supports static image imports with `next/image`. This new feature relies on being able to process image imports. If you previously added the `next-images` or `next-optimized-images` packages you can either move to the new built-in support using `next/image` or disable the feature:\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  images: {\n    disableStaticImages: true,\n  },\n}\n```\n\n### [Remove `super.componentDidCatch()` from `pages/_app.js`](#remove-supercomponentdidcatch-from-pages_appjs)\n\nThe `next/app` component's `componentDidCatch` was deprecated in Next.js 9 as it's no longer needed and has since been a no-op. In Next.js 11, it was removed.\n\nIf your `pages/_app.js` has a custom `componentDidCatch` method you can remove `super.componentDidCatch` as it is no longer needed.\n\n### [Remove `Container` from `pages/_app.js`](#remove-container-from-pages_appjs)\n\nThis export was deprecated in Next.js 9 as it's no longer needed and has since been a no-op with a warning during development. In Next.js 11 it was removed.\n\nIf your `pages/_app.js` imports `Container` from `next/app` you can remove `Container` as it was removed. Learn more in [the documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/app-container-deprecated).\n\n### [Remove `props.url` usage from page components](#remove-propsurl-usage-from-page-components)\n\nThis property was deprecated in Next.js 4 and has since shown a warning during development. With the introduction of `getStaticProps` / `getServerSideProps` these methods already disallowed the usage of `props.url`. In Next.js 11, it was removed completely.\n\nYou can learn more in [the documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/url-deprecated).\n\n### [Remove `unsized` property on `next/image`](#remove-unsized-property-on-nextimage)\n\nThe `unsized` property on `next/image` was deprecated in Next.js 10.0.1. You can use `layout=\"fill\"` instead. In Next.js 11 `unsized` was removed.\n\n### [Remove `modules` property on `next/dynamic`](#remove-modules-property-on-nextdynamic)\n\nThe `modules` and `render` option for `next/dynamic` were deprecated in Next.js 9.5. This was done in order to make the `next/dynamic` API closer to `React.lazy`. In Next.js 11, the `modules` and `render` options were removed.\n\nThis option hasn't been mentioned in the documentation since Next.js 8 so it's less likely that your application is using it.\n\nIf your application does use `modules` and `render` you can refer to [the documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/next-dynamic-modules).\n\n### [Remove `Head.rewind`](#remove-headrewind)\n\n`Head.rewind` has been a no-op since Next.js 9.5, in Next.js 11 it was removed. You can safely remove your usage of `Head.rewind`.\n\n### [Moment.js locales excluded by default](#momentjs-locales-excluded-by-default)\n\nMoment.js includes translations for a lot of locales by default. Next.js now automatically excludes these locales by default to optimize bundle size for applications using Moment.js.\n\nTo load a specific locale use this snippet:\n\n```\nimport moment from 'moment'\nimport 'moment/locale/ja'\n \nmoment.locale('ja')\n```\n\nYou can opt-out of this new default by adding `excludeDefaultMomentLocales: false` to `next.config.js` if you do not want the new behavior, do note it's highly recommended to not disable this new optimization as it significantly reduces the size of Moment.js.\n\n### [Update usage of `router.events`](#update-usage-of-routerevents)\n\nIn case you're accessing `router.events` during rendering, in Next.js 11 `router.events` is no longer provided during pre-rendering. Ensure you're accessing `router.events` in `useEffect`:\n\n```\nuseEffect(() => {\n  const handleRouteChange = (url, { shallow }) => {\n    console.log(\n      `App is changing to ${url} ${\n        shallow ? 'with' : 'without'\n      } shallow routing`\n    )\n  }\n \n  router.events.on('routeChangeStart', handleRouteChange)\n \n  // If the component is unmounted, unsubscribe\n  // from the event with the `off` method:\n  return () => {\n    router.events.off('routeChangeStart', handleRouteChange)\n  }\n}, [router])\n```\n\nIf your application uses `router.router.events` which was an internal property that was not public please make sure to use `router.events` as well.\n\n## [React 16 to 17](#react-16-to-17)\n\nReact 17 introduced a new [JSX Transform](https://reactjs.org/blog/2020/09/22/introducing-the-new-jsx-transform.html) that brings a long-time Next.js feature to the wider React ecosystem: Not having to `import React from 'react'` when using JSX. When using React 17 Next.js will automatically use the new transform. This transform does not make the `React` variable global, which was an unintended side-effect of the previous Next.js implementation. A [codemod is available](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/upgrading/codemods#add-missing-react-import) to automatically fix cases where you accidentally used `React` without importing it.\n\nMost applications already use the latest version of React, with Next.js 11 the minimum React version has been updated to 17.0.2.\n\nTo upgrade you can run the following command:\n\n```\nnpm install react@latest react-dom@latest\n```\n\nOr using `yarn`:\n\n```\nyarn add react@latest react-dom@latest\n```",

    "markdown": "# Functions: useReportWebVitals | Next.js\n\nThe `useReportWebVitals` hook allows you to report [Core Web Vitals](https://web.dev/vitals/), and can be used in combination with your analytics service.\n\n```\nimport { useReportWebVitals } from 'next/web-vitals'\n \nfunction MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {\n  useReportWebVitals((metric) => {\n    console.log(metric)\n  })\n \n  return <Component {...pageProps} />\n}\n```\n\n## [useReportWebVitals](#usereportwebvitals)\n\nThe `metric` object passed as the hook's argument consists of a number of properties:\n\n*   `id`: Unique identifier for the metric in the context of the current page load\n*   `name`: The name of the performance metric. Possible values include names of [Web Vitals](#web-vitals) metrics (TTFB, FCP, LCP, FID, CLS) specific to a web application.\n*   `delta`: The difference between the current value and the previous value of the metric. The value is typically in milliseconds and represents the change in the metric's value over time.\n*   `entries`: An array of [Performance Entries](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/PerformanceEntry) associated with the metric. These entries provide detailed information about the performance events related to the metric.\n*   `navigationType`: Indicates the [type of navigation](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/PerformanceNavigationTiming/type) that triggered the metric collection. Possible values include `\"navigate\"`, `\"reload\"`, `\"back_forward\"`, and `\"prerender\"`.\n*   `rating`: A qualitative rating of the metric value, providing an assessment of the performance. Possible values are `\"good\"`, `\"needs-improvement\"`, and `\"poor\"`. The rating is typically determined by comparing the metric value against predefined thresholds that indicate acceptable or suboptimal performance.\n*   `value`: The actual value or duration of the performance entry, typically in milliseconds. The value provides a quantitative measure of the performance aspect being tracked by the metric. The source of the value depends on the specific metric being measured and can come from various [Performance API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Performance_API)s.\n\n## [Web Vitals](#web-vitals)\n\n[Web Vitals](https://web.dev/vitals/) are a set of useful metrics that aim to capture the user experience of a web page. The following web vitals are all included:\n\n*   [Time to First Byte](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Glossary/Time_to_first_byte) (TTFB)\n*   [First Contentful Paint](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Glossary/First_contentful_paint) (FCP)\n*   [Largest Contentful Paint](https://web.dev/lcp/) (LCP)\n*   [First Input Delay](https://web.dev/fid/) (FID)\n*   [Cumulative Layout Shift](https://web.dev/cls/) (CLS)\n*   [Interaction to Next Paint](https://web.dev/inp/) (INP)\n\nYou can handle all the results of these metrics using the `name` property.\n\n```\nimport { useReportWebVitals } from 'next/web-vitals'\n \nfunction MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {\n  useReportWebVitals((metric) => {\n    switch (metric.name) {\n      case 'FCP': {\n        // handle FCP results\n      }\n      case 'LCP': {\n        // handle LCP results\n      }\n      // ...\n    }\n  })\n \n  return <Component {...pageProps} />\n}\n```\n\n## [Custom Metrics](#custom-metrics)\n\nIn addition to the core metrics listed above, there are some additional custom metrics that measure the time it takes for the page to hydrate and render:\n\n*   `Next.js-hydration`: Length of time it takes for the page to start and finish hydrating (in ms)\n*   `Next.js-route-change-to-render`: Length of time it takes for a page to start rendering after a route change (in ms)\n*   `Next.js-render`: Length of time it takes for a page to finish render after a route change (in ms)\n\nYou can handle all the results of these metrics separately:\n\n```\nimport { useReportWebVitals } from 'next/web-vitals'\n \nfunction MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {\n  useReportWebVitals((metric) => {\n    switch (metric.name) {\n      case 'Next.js-hydration':\n        // handle hydration results\n        break\n      case 'Next.js-route-change-to-render':\n        // handle route-change to render results\n        break\n      case 'Next.js-render':\n        // handle render results\n        break\n      default:\n        break\n    }\n  })\n \n  return <Component {...pageProps} />\n}\n```\n\nThese metrics work in all browsers that support the [User Timing API](https://caniuse.com/#feat=user-timing).\n\n## [Usage on Vercel](#usage-on-vercel)\n\n[Vercel Speed Insights](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/speed-insights) are automatically configured on Vercel deployments, and don't require the use of `useReportWebVitals`. This hook is useful in local development, or if you're using a different analytics service.\n\n## [Sending results to external systems](#sending-results-to-external-systems)\n\nYou can send results to any endpoint to measure and track real user performance on your site. For example:\n\n```\nuseReportWebVitals((metric) => {\n  const body = JSON.stringify(metric)\n  const url = 'https://example.com/analytics'\n \n  // Use `navigator.sendBeacon()` if available, falling back to `fetch()`.\n  if (navigator.sendBeacon) {\n    navigator.sendBeacon(url, body)\n  } else {\n    fetch(url, { body, method: 'POST', keepalive: true })\n  }\n})\n```\n\n> **Good to know**: If you use [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/), using the `id` value can allow you to construct metric distributions manually (to calculate percentiles, etc.)\n\n> ```\n> useReportWebVitals(metric => {\n>   // Use `window.gtag` if you initialized Google Analytics as this example:\n>   // https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/examples/with-google-analytics/pages/_app.js\n>   window.gtag('event', metric.name, {\n>     value: Math.round(metric.name === 'CLS' ? metric.value * 1000 : metric.value), // values must be integers\n>     event_label: metric.id, // id unique to current page load\n>     non_interaction: true, // avoids affecting bounce rate.\n>   });\n> }\n> ```\n> \n> Read more about [sending results to Google Analytics](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/web-vitals#send-the-results-to-google-analytics).",

The file must export a default function that returns a string, for example:\n\n```\nexport default function myImageLoader({ src, width, quality }) {\n  return `https://example.com/${src}?w=${width}&q=${quality || 75}`\n}\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can use the [`loader` prop](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/components/image#loader) to pass the function to each instance of `next/image`.\n\nTo learn more about configuring the behavior of the built-in [Image Optimization API](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/images) and the [Image Component](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/components/image), see [Image Configuration Options](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/components/image#configuration-options) for available options.\n\n## [Example Loader Configuration](#example-loader-configuration)\n\n*   [Akamai](#akamai)\n*   [AWS CloudFront](#aws-cloudfront)\n*   [Cloudinary](#cloudinary)\n*   [Cloudflare](#cloudflare)\n*   [Contentful](#contentful)\n*   [Fastly](#fastly)\n*   [Gumlet](#gumlet)\n*   [ImageEngine](#imageengine)\n*   [Imgix](#imgix)\n*   [Thumbor](#thumbor)\n*   [Sanity](#sanity)\n*   [Sirv](#sirv)\n*   [Supabase](#supabase)\n\n### [Akamai](#akamai)\n\n```\n// Docs: https://techdocs.akamai.com/ivm/reference/test-images-on-demand\nexport default function akamaiLoader({ src, width, quality }) {\n  return `https://example.com/${src}?imwidth=${width}`\n}\n```\n\n### [AWS CloudFront](#aws-cloudfront)\n\n```\n// Docs: https://aws.amazon.com/developer/application-security-performance/articles/image-optimization\nexport default function cloudfrontLoader({ src, width, quality }) {\n  const url = new URL(`https://example.com${src}`)\n  url.searchParams.set('format', 'auto')\n  url.searchParams.set('width', width.toString())\n  url.searchParams.set('quality', (quality || 75).toString())\n  return url.href\n```\n\n### [Cloudinary](#cloudinary)\n\n```\n// Demo: https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/w_300,c_limit,q_auto/turtles.jpg\nexport default function cloudinaryLoader({ src, width, quality }) {\n  const params = ['f_auto', 'c_limit', `w_${width}`, `q_${quality || 'auto'}`]\n  return `https://example.com/${params.join(',')}${src}`\n}\n```\n\n### [Cloudflare](#cloudflare)\n\n```\n// Docs: https://developers.cloudflare.com/images/url-format\nexport default function cloudflareLoader({ src, width, quality }) {\n  const params = [`width=${width}`, `quality=${quality || 75}`, 'format=auto']\n  return `https://example.com/cdn-cgi/image/${params.join(',')}/${src}`\n}\n```\n\n### [Contentful](#contentful)\n\n```\n// Docs: https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/references/images-api/\nexport default function contentfulLoader({ src, width, quality }) {\n  const url = new URL(`https://example.com${src}`)\n  url.searchParams.set('fm', 'webp')\n  url.searchParams.set('w', width.toString())\n  url.searchParams.set('q', (quality || 75).toString())\n  return url.href\n}\n```\n\n### [Fastly](#fastly)\n\n```\n// Docs: https://developer.fastly.com/reference/io/\nexport default function fastlyLoader({ src, width, quality }) {\n  const url = new URL(`https://example.com${src}`)\n  url.searchParams.set('auto', 'webp')\n  url.searchParams.set('width', width.toString())\n  url.searchParams.set('quality', (quality || 75).toString())\n  return url.href\n}\n```\n\n### [Gumlet](#gumlet)\n\n```\n// Docs: https://docs.gumlet.com/reference/image-transform-size\nexport default function gumletLoader({ src, width, quality }) {\n  const url = new URL(`https://example.com${src}`)\n  url.searchParams.set('format', 'auto')\n  url.searchParams.set('w', width.toString())\n  url.searchParams.set('q', (quality || 75).toString())\n  return url.href\n}\n```\n\n### [ImageEngine](#imageengine)\n\n```\n// Docs: https://support.imageengine.io/hc/en-us/articles/360058880672-Directives\nexport default function imageengineLoader({ src, width, quality }) {\n  const compression = 100 -

However, it’s not ideal when you’re writing a draft on your headless CMS and want to **preview** the draft immediately on your page. You’d want Next.js to render these pages at **request time** instead of build time and fetch the draft content instead of the published content. You’d want Next.js to bypass Static Generation only for this specific case.\n\nNext.js has a feature called **Preview Mode** which solves this problem. Here are instructions on how to use it.\n\n## [Step 1: Create and access a preview API route](#step-1-create-and-access-a-preview-api-route)\n\n> Take a look at the [API Routes documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) first if you’re not familiar with Next.js API Routes.\n\nFirst, create a **preview API route**. It can have any name - e.g. `pages/api/preview.js` (or `.ts` if using TypeScript).\n\nIn this API route, you need to call `setPreviewData` on the response object. The argument for `setPreviewData` should be an object, and this can be used by `getStaticProps` (more on this later). For now, we’ll use `{}`.\n\n```\nexport default function handler(req, res) {\n  // ...\n  res.setPreviewData({})\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n`res.setPreviewData` sets some **cookies** on the browser which turns on the preview mode. Any requests to Next.js containing these cookies will be considered as the **preview mode**, and the behavior for statically generated pages will change (more on this later).\n\nYou can test this manually by creating an API route like below and accessing it from your browser manually:\n\n```\n// simple example for testing it manually from your browser.\nexport default function handler(req, res) {\n  res.setPreviewData({})\n  res.end('Preview mode enabled')\n}\n```\n\nIf you open your browser’s developer tools and visit `/api/preview`, you’ll notice that the `__prerender_bypass` and `__next_preview_data` cookies will be set on this request.\n\n### [Securely accessing it from your Headless CMS](#securely-accessing-it-from-your-headless-cms)\n\nIn practice, you’d want to call this API route _securely_ from your headless CMS. The specific steps will vary depending on which headless CMS you’re using, but here are some common steps you could take.\n\nThese steps assume that the headless CMS you’re using supports setting **custom preview URLs**. If it doesn’t, you can still use this method to secure your preview URLs, but you’ll need to construct and access the preview URL manually.\n\n**First**, you should create a **secret token string** using a token generator of your choice. This secret will only be known by your Next.js app and your headless CMS. This secret prevents people who don’t have access to your CMS from accessing preview URLs.\n\n**Second**, if your headless CMS supports setting custom preview URLs, specify the following as the preview URL. This assumes that your preview API route is located at `pages/api/preview.js`.\n\n```\nhttps://<your-site>/api/preview?secret=<token>&slug=<path>\n```\n\n*   `<your-site>` should be your deployment domain.\n*   `<token>` should be replaced with the secret token you generated.\n*   `<path>` should be the path for the page that you want to preview. If you want to preview `/posts/foo`, then you should use `&slug=/posts/foo`.\n\nYour headless CMS might allow you to include a variable in the preview URL so that `<path>` can be set dynamically based on the CMS’s data like so: `&slug=/posts/{entry.fields.slug}`\n\n**Finally**, in the preview API route:\n\n*   Check that the secret matches and that the `slug` parameter exists (if not, the request should fail).\n\n*   Call `res.setPreviewData`.\n*   Then redirect the browser to the path specified by `slug`. (The following example uses a [307 redirect](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/307)).\n\n```\nexport default async (req, res) => {\n  // Check the secret and next parameters\n  // This secret should only be known to this API route and the CMS\n  if (req.query.secret !== 'MY_SECRET_TOKEN' || !req.query.slug) {\n    return res.status(401).json({ message: 'Invalid token' })\n  }\n \n  // Fetch the headless CMS to check if the provided `slug` exists\n  // getPostBySlug would implement the required fetching logic to the headless CMS\n  const post = await getPostBySlug(req.query.slug)\n \n  // If the slug doesn't exist prevent preview mode from being enabled\n  if (!post) {\n    return res.status(401).json({ message: 'Invalid slug' })\n  }\n \n  // Enable Preview Mode by setting the cookies\n  res.setPreviewData({})\n \n  // Redirect to the path from the fetched post\n  // We don't redirect to req.query.slug as that might lead to open redirect vulnerabilities\n  res.redirect(post.slug)\n}\n```\n\nIf it succeeds, then the browser will be redirected to the path you want to preview with the preview mode cookies being set.\n\n## [Step 2: Update `getStaticProps`](#step-2-update-getstaticprops)\n\nThe next step is to update `getStaticProps` to support the preview mode.\n\nIf you request a page which has `getStaticProps` with the preview mode cookies set (via `res.setPreviewData`), then `getStaticProps` will be called at **request time** (instead of at build time).\n\nFurthermore, it will be called with a `context` object where:\n\n*   `context.preview` will be `true`.\n*   `context.previewData` will be the same as the argument used for `setPreviewData`.\n\n```\nexport async function getStaticProps(context) {\n  // If you request this page with the preview mode cookies set:\n  //\n  // - context.preview will be true\n  // - context.previewData will be the same as\n  //   the argument used for `setPreviewData`.\n}\n```\n\nWe used `res.setPreviewData({})` in the preview API route, so `context.previewData` will be `{}`. You can use this to pass session information from the preview API route to `getStaticProps` if necessary.\n\nIf you’re also using `getStaticPaths`, then `context.params` will also be available.\n\n### [Fetch preview data](#fetch-preview-data)\n\nYou can update `getStaticProps` to fetch different data based on `context.preview` and/or `context.previewData`.\n\nFor example, your headless CMS might have a different API endpoint for draft posts. If so, you can use `context.preview` to modify the API endpoint URL like below:\n\n```\nexport async function getStaticProps(context) {\n  // If context.preview is true, append \"/preview\" to the API endpoint\n  // to request draft data instead of published data. This will vary\n  // based on which headless CMS you're using.\n  const res = await fetch(`https://.../${context.preview ? 'preview' : ''}`)\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\nThat’s it! If you access the preview API route (with `secret` and `slug`) from your headless CMS or manually, you should now be able to see the preview content. And if you update your draft without publishing, you should be able to preview the draft.\n\nSet this as the preview URL on your headless CMS or access manually, and you should be able to see the preview.\n\n```\nhttps://<your-site>/api/preview?secret=<token>&slug=<path>\n```\n\n## [More Details](#more-details)\n\n> **Good to know**: during rendering `next/router` exposes an `isPreview` flag, see the [router object docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/use-router#router-object) for more info.\n\n### [Specify the Preview Mode duration](#specify-the-preview-mode-duration)\n\n`setPreviewData` takes an optional second parameter which should be an options object. It accepts the following keys:\n\n*   `maxAge`: Specifies the number (in seconds) for the preview session to last for.\n*   `path`: Specifies the path the cookie should be applied under. Defaults to `/` enabling preview mode for all paths.\n\n```\nsetPreviewData(data, {\n  maxAge: 60 * 60, // The preview mode cookies expire in 1 hour\n  path: '/about', // The preview mode cookies apply to paths with /about\n})\n```\n\n### [Clear the Preview Mode cookies](#clear-the-preview-mode-cookies)\n\nBy default, no expiration date is set for Preview Mode cookies, so the preview session ends when the browser is closed.\n\nTo clear the Preview Mode cookies manually, create an API route that calls `clearPreviewData()`:\n\n```\nexport default function handler(req, res) {\n  res.clearPreviewData({})\n}\n```\n\nThen, send a request to `/api/clear-preview-mode-cookies` to invoke the API Route. If calling this route using [`next/link`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/components/link), you must pass `prefetch={false}` to prevent calling `clearPreviewData` during link prefetching.\n\nIf a path was specified in the `setPreviewData` call, you must pass the same path to `clearPreviewData`:\n\n```\nexport default function handler(req, res) {\n  const { path } = req.query\n \n  res.clearPreviewData({ path })\n}\n```\n\n### [`previewData` size limits](#previewdata-size-limits)\n\nYou can pass an object to `setPreviewData` and have it be available in `getStaticProps`. However, because the data will be stored in a cookie, there’s a size limitation. Currently, preview data is limited to 2KB.\n\n### [Works with `getServerSideProps`](#works-with-getserversideprops)\n\nThe preview mode works on `getServerSideProps` as well. It will also be available on the `context` object containing `preview` and `previewData`.\n\n> **Good to know**: You shouldn't set the `Cache-Control` header when using Preview Mode because it cannot be bypassed. Instead, we recommend using [ISR](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/incremental-static-regeneration).\n\n### [Works with API Routes](#works-with-api-routes)\n\nAPI Routes will have access to `preview` and `previewData` under the request object. For example:\n\n```\nexport default function myApiRoute(req, res) {\n  const isPreview = req.preview\n  const previewData = req.previewData\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n### [Unique per `next build`](#unique-per-next-build)\n\nBoth the bypass cookie value and the private key for encrypting the `previewData` change when `next build` is completed. This ensures that the bypass cookie can’t be guessed.\n\n> **Good to know**: To test Preview Mode locally over HTTP your browser will need to allow third-party cookies and local storage access.",

Therefore, `basePath`, `locale` and trailing slash (`trailingSlash: true`) are not included.\n*   `query`: `Object` - The query string parsed to an object, including [dynamic route](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes) parameters. It will be an empty object during prerendering if the page doesn't use [Server-side Rendering](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-server-side-props). Defaults to `{}`\n*   `asPath`: `String` - The path as shown in the browser including the search params and respecting the `trailingSlash` configuration. `basePath` and `locale` are not included.\n*   `isFallback`: `boolean` - Whether the current page is in [fallback mode](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/get-static-paths#fallback-true).\n*   `basePath`: `String` - The active [basePath](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/basePath) (if enabled).\n*   `locale`: `String` - The active locale (if enabled).\n*   `locales`: `String[]` - All supported locales (if enabled).\n*   `defaultLocale`: `String` - The current default locale (if enabled).\n*   `domainLocales`: `Array<{domain, defaultLocale, locales}>` - Any configured domain locales.\n*   `isReady`: `boolean` - Whether the router fields are updated client-side and ready for use. Should only be used inside of `useEffect` methods and not for conditionally rendering on the server. See related docs for use case with [automatically statically optimized pages](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/rendering/automatic-static-optimization)\n*   `isPreview`: `boolean` - Whether the application is currently in [preview mode](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/preview-mode).\n\n> Using the `asPath` field may lead to a mismatch between client and server if the page is rendered using server-side rendering or [automatic static optimization](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/rendering/automatic-static-optimization). Avoid using `asPath` until the `isReady` field is `true`.\n\nThe following methods are included inside `router`:\n\n### [router.push](#routerpush)\n\nHandles client-side transitions, this method is useful for cases where [`next/link`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/components/link) is not enough.\n\n```\nrouter.push(url, as, options)\n```\n\n*   `url`: `UrlObject | String` - The URL to navigate to (see [Node.JS URL module documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/url.html#legacy-urlobject) for `UrlObject` properties).\n*   `as`: `UrlObject | String` - Optional decorator for the path that will be shown in the browser URL bar. Before Next.js 9.5.3 this was used for dynamic routes.\n*   `options` - Optional object with the following configuration options:\n    *   `scroll` - Optional boolean, controls scrolling to the top of the page after navigation. Defaults to `true`\n    *   [`shallow`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/linking-and-navigating#shallow-routing): Update the path of the current page without rerunning [`getStaticProps`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-static-props), [`getServerSideProps`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-server-side-props) or [`getInitialProps`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/get-initial-props). Defaults to `false`\n    *   `locale` - Optional string, indicates locale of the new page\n\n> You don't need to use `router.push` for external URLs. [window.location](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Window/location) is better suited for those cases.\n\nNavigating to `pages/about.js`, which is a predefined route:\n\n```\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/router'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  const router = useRouter()\n \n  return (\n    <button type=\"button\" onClick={() => router.push('/about')}>\n      Click me\n    </button>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nNavigating `pages/post/[pid].js`, which is a dynamic route:\n\n```\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/router'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  const router = useRouter()\n \n  return (\n    <button type=\"button\" onClick={() => router.push('/post/abc')}>\n      Click me\n    </button>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nRedirecting the user to `pages/login.js`, useful for pages behind [authentication](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/authentication):\n\n```\nimport { useEffect } from 'react'\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/router'\n \n// Here you would fetch and return the user\nconst useUser = () => ({ user: null, loading: false })\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  const { user, loading } = useUser()\n  const router = useRouter()\n \n  useEffect(() => {\n    if (!(user || loading)) {\n      router.push('/login')\n    }\n  }, [user, loading])\n \n  return <p>Redirecting...</p>\n}\n```\n\n#### [Resetting state after navigation](#resetting-state-after-navigation)\n\nWhen navigating to the same page in Next.js, the page's state **will not** be reset by default as React does not unmount unless the parent component has changed.\n\n```\nimport Link from 'next/link'\nimport { useState } from 'react'\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/router'\n \nexport default function Page(props) {\n  const router = useRouter()\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Page: {router.query.slug}</h1>\n      <p>Count: {count}</p>\n      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increase count</button>\n      <Link href=\"/one\">one</Link> <Link href=\"/two\">two</Link>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nIn the above example, navigating between `/one` and `/two` **will not** reset the count . The `useState` is maintained between renders because the top-level React component, `Page`, is the same.\n\nIf you do not want this behavior, you have a couple of options:\n\n*   Manually ensure each state is updated using `useEffect`. In the above example, that could look like:\n    \n    ```\n    useEffect(() => {\n      setCount(0)\n    }, [router.query.slug])\n    ```\n    \n*   Use a React `key` to [tell React to remount the component](https://react.dev/learn/rendering-lists#keeping-list-items-in-order-with-key). To do this for all pages, you can use a custom app:\n    \n    ```\n    import { useRouter } from 'next/router'\n     \n    export default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {\n      const router = useRouter()\n      return <Component key={router.asPath} {...pageProps} />\n    }\n    ```\n    \n\n#### [With URL object](#with-url-object)\n\nYou can use a URL object in the same way you can use it for [`next/link`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/components/link#with-url-object). Works for both the `url` and `as` parameters:\n\n```\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/router'\n \nexport default function ReadMore({ post }) {\n  const router = useRouter()\n \n  return (\n    <button\n      type=\"button\"\n      onClick={() => {\n        router.push({\n          pathname: '/post/[pid]',\n          query: { pid: post.id },\n        })\n      }}\n    >\n      Click here to read more\n    </button>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n### [router.replace](#routerreplace)\n\nSimilar to the `replace` prop in [`next/link`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/components/link), `router.replace` will prevent adding a new URL entry into the `history` stack.\n\n```\nrouter.replace(url, as, options)\n```\n\n*   The API for `router.replace` is exactly the same as the API for [`router.push`](#routerpush).\n\nTake a look at the following example:\n\n```\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/router'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  const router = useRouter()\n \n  return (\n    <button type=\"button\" onClick={() => router.replace('/home')}>\n      Click me\n    </button>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n### [router.prefetch](#routerprefetch)\n\nPrefetch pages for faster client-side transitions. This method is only useful for navigations without [`next/link`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/components/link), as `next/link` takes care of prefetching pages automatically.\n\n> This is a production only feature. Next.js doesn't prefetch pages in development.\n\n```\nrouter.prefetch(url, as, options)\n```\n\n*   `url` - The URL to prefetch, including explicit routes (e.g. `/dashboard`) and dynamic routes (e.g. `/product/[id]`)\n*   `as` - Optional decorator for `url`. Before Next.js 9.5.3 this was used to prefetch dynamic routes.\n*   `options` - Optional object with the following allowed fields:\n    *   `locale` - allows providing a different locale from the active one. If `false`, `url` has to include the locale as the active locale won't be used.\n\nLet's say you have a login page, and after a login, you redirect the user to the dashboard. For that case, we can prefetch the dashboard to make a faster transition, like in the following example:\n\n```\nimport { useCallback, useEffect } from 'react'\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/router'\n \nexport default function Login() {\n  const router = useRouter()\n  const handleSubmit = useCallback((e) => {\n    e.preventDefault()\n \n    fetch('/api/login', {\n      method: 'POST',\n      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },\n      body: JSON.stringify({\n        /* Form data */\n      }),\n    }).then((res) => {\n      // Do a fast client-side transition to the already prefetched dashboard page\n      if (res.ok) router.push('/dashboard')\n    })\n  }, [])\n \n  useEffect(() => {\n    // Prefetch the dashboard page\n    router.prefetch('/dashboard')\n  }, [router])\n \n  return (\n    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>\n      {/* Form fields */}\n      <button type=\"submit\">Login</button>\n    </form>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n### [router.beforePopState](#routerbeforepopstate)\n\nIn some cases (for example, if using a [Custom Server](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/custom-server)), you may wish to listen to [popstate](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Events/popstate) and do something before the router acts on it.\n\n```\nrouter.beforePopState(cb)\n```\n\n*   `cb` - The function to run on incoming `popstate` events. The function receives the state of the event as an object with the following props:\n    *   `url`: `String` - the route for the new state. This is usually the name of a `page`\n    *   `as`: `String` - the url that will be shown in the browser\n    *   `options`: `Object` - Additional options sent by [router.push](#routerpush)\n\nIf `cb` returns `false`, the Next.js router will not handle `popstate`, and you'll be responsible for handling it in that case. See [Disabling file-system routing](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/custom-server#disabling-file-system-routing).\n\nYou could use `beforePopState` to manipulate the request, or force a SSR refresh, as in the following example:\n\n```\nimport { useEffect } from 'react'\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/router'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  const router = useRouter()\n \n  useEffect(() => {\n    router.beforePopState(({ url, as, options }) => {\n      // I only want to allow these two routes!\n      if (as !== '/' && as !== '/other') {\n        // Have SSR render bad routes as a 404.\n        window.location.href = as\n        return false\n      }\n \n      return true\n    })\n  }, [router])\n \n  return <p>Welcome to the page</p>\n}\n```\n\n### [router.back](#routerback)\n\nNavigate back in history. Equivalent to clicking the browser’s back button. It executes `window.history.back()`.\n\n```\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/router'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  const router = useRouter()\n \n  return (\n    <button type=\"button\" onClick={() => router.back()}>\n      Click here to go back\n    </button>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n### [router.reload](#routerreload)\n\nReload the current URL. Equivalent to clicking the browser’s refresh button. It executes `window.location.reload()`.\n\n```\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/router'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  const router = useRouter()\n \n  return (\n    <button type=\"button\" onClick={() => router.reload()}>\n      Click here to reload\n    </button>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n### [router.events](#routerevents)\n\nYou can listen to different events happening inside the Next.js Router. Here's a list of supported events:\n\n*   `routeChangeStart(url, { shallow })` - Fires when a route starts to change\n*   `routeChangeComplete(url, { shallow })` - Fires when a route changed completely\n*   `routeChangeError(err, url, { shallow })` - Fires when there's an error when changing routes, or a route load is cancelled\n    *   `err.cancelled` - Indicates if the navigation was cancelled\n*   `beforeHistoryChange(url, { shallow })` - Fires before changing the browser's history\n*   `hashChangeStart(url, { shallow })` - Fires when the hash will change but not the page\n*   `hashChangeComplete(url, { shallow })` - Fires when the hash has changed but not the page\n\n> **Good to know**: Here `url` is the URL shown in the browser, including the [`basePath`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/basePath).\n\nFor example, to listen to the router event `routeChangeStart`, open or create `pages/_app.js` and subscribe to the event, like so:\n\n```\nimport { useEffect } from 'react'\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/router'\n \nexport default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {\n  const router = useRouter()\n \n  useEffect(() => {\n    const handleRouteChange = (url, { shallow }) => {\n      console.log(\n        `App is changing to ${url} ${\n          shallow ? 'with' : 'without'\n        } shallow routing`\n      )\n    }\n \n    router.events.on('routeChangeStart', handleRouteChange)\n \n    // If the component is unmounted, unsubscribe\n    // from the event with the `off` method:\n    return () => {\n      router.events.off('routeChangeStart', handleRouteChange)\n    }\n  }, [router])\n \n  return <Component {...pageProps} />\n}\n```\n\n> We use a [Custom App](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/custom-app) (`pages/_app.js`) for this example to subscribe to the event because it's not unmounted on page navigations, but you can subscribe to router events on any component in your application.\n\nRouter events should be registered when a component mounts ([useEffect](https://react.dev/reference/react/useEffect) or [componentDidMount](https://react.dev/reference/react/Component#componentdidmount) / [componentWillUnmount](https://react.dev/reference/react/Component#componentwillunmount)) or imperatively when an event happens.\n\nIf a route load is cancelled (for example, by clicking two links rapidly in succession), `routeChangeError` will fire. And the passed `err` will contain a `cancelled` property set to `true`, as in the following example:\n\n```\nimport { useEffect } from 'react'\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/router'\n \nexport default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {\n  const router = useRouter()\n \n  useEffect(() => {\n    const handleRouteChangeError = (err, url) => {\n      if (err.cancelled) {\n        console.log(`Route to ${url} was cancelled!`)\n      }\n    }\n \n    router.events.on('routeChangeError', handleRouteChangeError)\n \n    // If the component is unmounted, unsubscribe\n    // from the event with the `off` method:\n    return () => {\n      router.events.off('routeChangeError', handleRouteChangeError)\n    }\n  }, [router])\n \n  return <Component {...pageProps} />\n}\n```\n\n## [Potential ESLint errors](#potential-eslint-errors)\n\nCertain methods accessible on the `router` object return a Promise. If you have the ESLint rule, [no-floating-promises](https://typescript-eslint.io/rules/no-floating-promises) enabled, consider disabling it either globally, or for the affected line.\n\nIf your application needs this rule, you should either `void` the promise – or use an `async` function, `await` the Promise, then void the function call. **This is not applicable when the method is called from inside an `onClick` handler**.\n\nThe affected methods are:\n\n*   `router.push`\n*   `router.replace`\n*   `router.prefetch`\n\n### [Potential solutions](#potential-solutions)\n\n```\nimport { useEffect } from 'react'\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/router'\n \n// Here you would fetch and return the user\nconst useUser = () => ({ user: null, loading: false })\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  const { user, loading } = useUser()\n  const router = useRouter()\n \n  useEffect(() => {\n    // disable the linting on the next line - This is the cleanest solution\n    // eslint-disable-next-line no-floating-promises\n    router.push('/login')\n \n    // void the Promise returned by router.push\n    if (!(user || loading)) {\n      void router.push('/login')\n    }\n    // or use an async function, await the Promise, then void the function call\n    async function handleRouteChange() {\n      if (!(user || loading)) {\n        await router.push('/login')\n      }\n    }\n    void handleRouteChange()\n  }, [user, loading])\n \n  return <p>Redirecting...</p>\n}\n```\n\n## [withRouter](#withrouter)\n\nIf [`useRouter`](#router-object) is not the best fit for you, `withRouter` can also add the same [`router` object](#router-object) to any component.\n\n### [Usage](#usage)\n\n```\nimport { withRouter } from 'next/router'\n \nfunction Page({ router }) {\n  return <p>{router.pathname}</p>\n}\n \nexport default withRouter(Page)\n```\n\n### [TypeScript](#typescript)\n\nTo use class components with `withRouter`, the component needs to accept a router prop:\n\n```\nimport React from 'react'\nimport { withRouter, NextRouter } from 'next/router'\n \ninterface WithRouterProps {\n  router: NextRouter\n}\n \ninterface MyComponentProps extends WithRouterProps {}\n \nclass MyComponent extends React.Component<MyComponentProps> {\n  render() {\n    return <p>{this.props.router.pathname}</p>\n  }\n}\n \nexport default withRouter(MyComponent)\n```",

    "markdown": "# Configuring: Content Security Policy | Next.js\n\n[Content Security Policy (CSP)](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) is important to guard your Next.js application against various security threats such as cross-site scripting (XSS), clickjacking, and other code injection attacks.\n\nBy using CSP, developers can specify which origins are permissible for content sources, scripts, stylesheets, images, fonts, objects, media (audio, video), iframes, and more.\n\nExamples\n\n*   [Strict CSP](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-strict-csp)\n\n## [Nonces](#nonces)\n\nA [nonce](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/nonce) is a unique, random string of characters created for a one-time use. It is used in conjunction with CSP to selectively allow certain inline scripts or styles to execute, bypassing strict CSP directives.\n\n### [Why use a nonce?](#why-use-a-nonce)\n\nEven though CSPs are designed to block malicious scripts, there are legitimate scenarios where inline scripts are necessary. In such cases, nonces offer a way to allow these scripts to execute if they have the correct nonce.\n\n### [Adding a nonce with Middleware](#adding-a-nonce-with-middleware)\n\n[Middleware](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware) enables you to add headers and generate nonces before the page renders.\n\nEvery time a page is viewed, a fresh nonce should be generated. This means that you **must use dynamic rendering to add nonces**.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nimport { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n \nexport function middleware(request: NextRequest) {\n  const nonce = Buffer.from(crypto.randomUUID()).toString('base64')\n  const cspHeader = `\n    default-src 'self';\n    script-src 'self' 'nonce-${nonce}' 'strict-dynamic';\n    style-src 'self' 'nonce-${nonce}';\n    img-src 'self' blob: data:;\n    font-src 'self';\n    object-src 'none';\n    base-uri 'self';\n    form-action 'self';\n    frame-ancestors 'none';\n    upgrade-insecure-requests;\n`\n  // Replace newline characters and spaces\n  const contentSecurityPolicyHeaderValue = cspHeader\n    .replace(/\\s{2,}/g, ' ')\n    .trim()\n \n  const requestHeaders = new Headers(request.headers)\n  requestHeaders.set('x-nonce', nonce)\n \n  requestHeaders.set(\n    'Content-Security-Policy',\n    contentSecurityPolicyHeaderValue\n  )\n \n  const response = NextResponse.next({\n    request: {\n      headers: requestHeaders,\n    },\n  })\n  response.headers.set(\n    'Content-Security-Policy',\n    contentSecurityPolicyHeaderValue\n  )\n \n  return response\n}\n```\n\nBy default, Middleware runs on all requests. You can filter Middleware to run on specific paths using a [`matcher`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware#matcher).\n\nWe recommend ignoring matching prefetches (from `next/link`) and static assets that don't need the CSP header.\n\n```\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: [\n    /*\n     * Match all request paths except for the ones starting with:\n     * - api (API routes)\n     * - _next/static (static files)\n     * - _next/image (image optimization files)\n     * - favicon.ico (favicon file)\n     */\n    {\n      source: '/((?!api|_next/static|_next/image|favicon.ico).*)',\n      missing: [\n        { type: 'header', key: 'next-router-prefetch' },\n        { type: 'header', key: 'purpose', value: 'prefetch' },\n      ],\n    },\n  ],\n}\n```\n\n### [Reading the nonce](#reading-the-nonce)\n\nYou can now read the nonce from a [Server Component](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components) using [`headers`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/headers):\n\n```\nimport { headers } from 'next/headers'\nimport Script from 'next/script'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  const nonce = headers().get('x-nonce')\n \n  return (\n    <Script\n      src=\"https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js\"\n      strategy=\"afterInteractive\"\n      nonce={nonce}\n    />\n  )\n}\n```\n\n## [Without Nonces](#without-nonces)\n\nFor applications that do not require nonces, you can set the CSP header directly in your [`next.config.js`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js) file:\n\n```\nconst cspHeader = `\n    default-src 'self';\n    script-src 'self' 'unsafe-eval' 'unsafe-inline';\n    style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';\n    img-src 'self' blob: data:;\n    font-src 'self';\n    object-src 'none';\n    base-uri 'self';\n    form-action 'self';\n    frame-ancestors 'none';\n    upgrade-insecure-requests;\n`\n \nmodule.exports = {\n  async headers() {\n    return [\n      {\n        source: '/(.*)',\n        headers: [\n          {\n            key: 'Content-Security-Policy',\n            value: cspHeader.replace(/\\n/g, ''),\n          },\n        ],\n      },\n    ]\n  },\n}\n```\n\n## [Version History](#version-history)\n\nWe recommend using `v13.4.20+` of Next.js to properly handle and apply nonces.",

    "markdown": "# Upgrading: Version 9 | Next.js\n\nTo upgrade to version 9, run the following command:\n\n> **Good to know:** If you are using TypeScript, ensure you also upgrade `@types/react` and `@types/react-dom` to their corresponding versions.\n\n## [Production Deployment on Vercel](#production-deployment-on-vercel)\n\nIf you previously configured `routes` in your `vercel.json` file for dynamic routes, these rules can be removed when leveraging Next.js 9's new [Dynamic Routing feature](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes).\n\nNext.js 9's dynamic routes are **automatically configured on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)** and do not require any `vercel.json` customization.\n\nYou can read more about [Dynamic Routing here](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes).\n\n## [Check your Custom App File (`pages/_app.js`)](#check-your-custom-app-file-pages_appjs)\n\nIf you previously copied the [Custom `<App>`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/custom-app) example, you may be able to remove your `getInitialProps`.\n\nRemoving `getInitialProps` from `pages/_app.js` (when possible) is important to leverage new Next.js features!\n\nThe following `getInitialProps` does nothing and may be removed:\n\n```\nclass MyApp extends App {\n  // Remove me, I do nothing!\n  static async getInitialProps({ Component, ctx }) {\n    let pageProps = {}\n \n    if (Component.getInitialProps) {\n      pageProps = await Component.getInitialProps(ctx)\n    }\n \n    return { pageProps }\n  }\n \n  render() {\n    // ... etc\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## [Breaking Changes](#breaking-changes)\n\n### [`@zeit/next-typescript` is no longer necessary](#zeitnext-typescript-is-no-longer-necessary)\n\nNext.js will now ignore usage `@zeit/next-typescript` and warn you to remove it. Please remove this plugin from your `next.config.js`.\n\nRemove references to `@zeit/next-typescript/babel` from your custom `.babelrc` (if present).\n\nThe usage of [`fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin`](https://github.com/Realytics/fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin/issues) should also be removed from your `next.config.js`.\n\nTypeScript Definitions are published with the `next` package, so you need to uninstall `@types/next` as they would conflict.\n\nThe following types are different:\n\n> This list was created by the community to help you upgrade, if you find other differences please send a pull-request to this list to help other users.\n\nFrom:\n\n```\nimport { NextContext } from 'next'\nimport { NextAppContext, DefaultAppIProps } from 'next/app'\nimport { NextDocumentContext, DefaultDocumentIProps } from 'next/document'\n```\n\nto\n\n```\nimport { NextPageContext } from 'next'\nimport { AppContext, AppInitialProps } from 'next/app'\nimport { DocumentContext, DocumentInitialProps } from 'next/document'\n```\n\n### [The `config` key is now an export on a page](#the-config-key-is-now-an-export-on-a-page)\n\nYou may no longer export a custom variable named `config` from a page (i.e. `export { config }` / `export const config ...`). This exported variable is now used to specify page-level Next.js configuration like Opt-in AMP and API Route features.\n\nYou must rename a non-Next.js-purposed `config` export to something different.\n\n### [`next/dynamic` no longer renders \"loading...\" by default while loading](#nextdynamic-no-longer-renders-loading-by-default-while-loading)\n\nDynamic components will not render anything by default while loading. You can still customize this behavior by setting the `loading` property:\n\n```\nimport dynamic from 'next/dynamic'\n \nconst DynamicComponentWithCustomLoading = dynamic(\n  () => import('../components/hello2'),\n  {\n    loading: () => <p>Loading</p>,\n  }\n)\n```\n\n### [`withAmp` has been removed in favor of an exported configuration object](#withamp-has-been-removed-in-favor-of-an-exported-configuration-object)\n\nNext.js now has the concept of page-level configuration, so the `withAmp` higher-order component has been removed for consistency.\n\nThis change can be **automatically migrated by running the following commands in the root of your Next.js project:**\n\n```\ncurl -L https://github.com/vercel/next-codemod/archive/master.tar.gz | tar -xz --strip=2 next-codemod-master/transforms/withamp-to-config.js npx jscodeshift -t ./withamp-to-config.js pages/**/*.js\n```\n\nTo perform this migration by hand, or view what the codemod will produce, see below:\n\n**Before**\n\n```\nimport { withAmp } from 'next/amp'\n \nfunction Home() {\n  return <h1>My AMP Page</h1>\n}\n \nexport default withAmp(Home)\n// or\nexport default withAmp(Home, { hybrid: true })\n```\n\n**After**\n\n```\nexport default function Home() {\n  return <h1>My AMP Page</h1>\n}\n \nexport const config = {\n  amp: true,\n  // or\n  amp: 'hybrid',\n}\n```\n\n### [`next export` no longer exports pages as `index.html`](#next-export-no-longer-exports-pages-as-indexhtml)\n\nPreviously, exporting `pages/about.js` would result in `out/about/index.html`. This behavior has been changed to result in `out/about.html`.\n\nYou can revert to the previous behavior by creating a `next.config.js` with the following content:\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  trailingSlash: true,\n}\n```\n\n### [`pages/api/` is treated differently](#pagesapi-is-treated-differently)\n\nPages in `pages/api/` are now considered [API Routes](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-9#api-routes). Pages in this directory will no longer contain a client-side bundle.\n\n## [Deprecated Features](#deprecated-features)\n\n### [`next/dynamic` has deprecated loading multiple modules at once](#nextdynamic-has-deprecated-loading-multiple-modules-at-once)\n\nThe ability to load multiple modules at once has been deprecated in `next/dynamic` to be closer to React's implementation (`React.lazy` and `Suspense`).\n\nUpdating code that relies on this behavior is relatively straightforward! We've provided an example of a before/after to help you migrate your application:\n\n**Before**\n\n```\nimport dynamic from 'next/dynamic'\n \nconst HelloBundle = dynamic({\n  modules: () => {\n    const components = {\n      Hello1: () => import('../components/hello1').then((m) => m.default),\n      Hello2: () => import('../components/hello2').then((m) => m.default),\n    }\n \n    return components\n  },\n  render: (props, { Hello1, Hello2 }) => (\n    <div>\n      <h1>{props.title}</h1>\n      <Hello1 />\n      <Hello2 />\n    </div>\n  ),\n})\n \nfunction DynamicBundle() {\n  return <HelloBundle title=\"Dynamic Bundle\" />\n}\n \nexport default DynamicBundle\n```\n\n**After**\n\n```\nimport dynamic from 'next/dynamic'\n \nconst Hello1 = dynamic(() => import('../components/hello1'))\nconst Hello2 = dynamic(() => import('../components/hello2'))\n \nfunction HelloBundle({ title }) {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>{title}</h1>\n      <Hello1 />\n      <Hello2 />\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n \nfunction DynamicBundle() {\n  return <HelloBundle title=\"Dynamic Bundle\" />\n}\n \nexport default DynamicBundle\n```",

    "markdown": "# next.config.js Options: output | Next.js\n\nDuring a build, Next.js will automatically trace each page and its dependencies to determine all of the files that are needed for deploying a production version of your application.\n\nThis feature helps reduce the size of deployments drastically. Previously, when deploying with Docker you would need to have all files from your package's `dependencies` installed to run `next start`. Starting with Next.js 12, you can leverage Output File Tracing in the `.next/` directory to only include the necessary files.\n\nFurthermore, this removes the need for the deprecated `serverless` target which can cause various issues and also creates unnecessary duplication.\n\n## [How it Works](#how-it-works)\n\nDuring `next build`, Next.js will use [`@vercel/nft`](https://github.com/vercel/nft) to statically analyze `import`, `require`, and `fs` usage to determine all files that a page might load.\n\nNext.js' production server is also traced for its needed files and output at `.next/next-server.js.nft.json` which can be leveraged in production.\n\nTo leverage the `.nft.json` files emitted to the `.next` output directory, you can read the list of files in each trace that are relative to the `.nft.json` file and then copy them to your deployment location.\n\n## [Automatically Copying Traced Files](#automatically-copying-traced-files)\n\nNext.js can automatically create a `standalone` folder that copies only the necessary files for a production deployment including select files in `node_modules`.\n\nTo leverage this automatic copying you can enable it in your `next.config.js`:\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  output: 'standalone',\n}\n```\n\nThis will create a folder at `.next/standalone` which can then be deployed on its own without installing `node_modules`.\n\nAdditionally, a minimal `server.js` file is also output which can be used instead of `next start`. This minimal server does not copy the `public` or `.next/static` folders by default as these should ideally be handled by a CDN instead, although these folders can be copied to the `standalone/public` and `standalone/.next/static` folders manually, after which `server.js` file will serve these automatically.\n\n> **Good to know**:\n> \n> *   `next.config.js` is read during `next build` and serialized into the `server.js` output file. If the legacy [`serverRuntimeConfig` or `publicRuntimeConfig` options](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/next-config-js/runtime-configuration) are being used, the values will be specific to values at build time.\n> *   If your project needs to listen to a specific port or hostname, you can define `PORT` or `HOSTNAME` environment variables before running `server.js`. For example, run `PORT=8080 HOSTNAME=0.0.0.0 node server.js` to start the server on `http://0.0.0.0:8080`.\n> *   If your project uses [Image Optimization](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/images) with the default `loader`, you must install `sharp` as a dependency:\n\n## [Caveats](#caveats)\n\n*   While tracing in monorepo setups, the project directory is used for tracing by default. For `next build packages/web-app`, `packages/web-app` would be the tracing root and any files outside of that folder will not be included. To include files outside of this folder you can set `experimental.outputFileTracingRoot` in your `next.config.js`.\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  experimental: {\n    // this includes files from the monorepo base two directories up\n    outputFileTracingRoot: path.join(__dirname, '../../'),\n  },\n}\n```\n\n*   There are some cases in which Next.js might fail to include required files, or might incorrectly include unused files. In those cases, you can leverage `experimental.outputFileTracingExcludes` and `experimental.outputFileTracingIncludes` respectively in `next.config.js`. Each config accepts an object with [minimatch globs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/minimatch) for the key to match specific pages and a value of an array with globs relative to the project's root to either include or exclude in the trace.\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  experimental: {\n    outputFileTracingExcludes: {\n      '/api/hello': ['./un-necessary-folder/**/*'],\n    },\n    outputFileTracingIncludes: {\n      '/api/another': ['./necessary-folder/**/*'],\n    },\n  },\n}\n```\n\n*   Currently, Next.js does not do anything with the emitted `.nft.json` files. The files must be read by your deployment platform, for example [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), to create a minimal deployment. In a future release, a new command is planned to utilize these `.nft.json` files.\n\n## [Experimental `turbotrace`](#experimental-turbotrace)\n\nTracing dependencies can be slow because it requires very complex computations and analysis. We created `turbotrace` in Rust as a faster and smarter alternative to the JavaScript implementation.\n\nTo enable it, you can add the following configuration to your `next.config.js`:\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  experimental: {\n    turbotrace: {\n      // control the log level of the turbotrace, default is `error`\n      logLevel?:\n      | 'bug'\n      | 'fatal'\n      | 'error'\n      | 'warning'\n      | 'hint'\n      | 'note'\n      | 'suggestions'\n      | 'info',\n      // control if the log of turbotrace should contain the details of the analysis, default is `false`\n      logDetail?: boolean\n      // show all log messages without limit\n      // turbotrace only show 1 log message for each categories by default\n      logAll?: boolean\n      // control the context directory of the turbotrace\n      // files outside of the context directory will not be traced\n      // set the `experimental.outputFileTracingRoot` has the same effect\n      // if the `experimental.outputFileTracingRoot` and this option are both set, the `experimental.turbotrace.contextDirectory` will be used\n      contextDirectory?: string\n      // if there is `process.cwd()` expression in your code, you can set this option to tell `turbotrace` the value of `process.cwd()` while tracing.\n      // for example the require(process.cwd() + '/package.json') will be traced as require('/path/to/cwd/package.json')\n      processCwd?: string\n      // control the maximum memory usage of the `turbotrace`, in `MB`, default is `6000`.\n      memoryLimit?: number\n    },\n  },\n}\n```",

You do not need to manually setup an Asset Prefix.\n\n> **Good to know**: Next.js 9.5+ added support for a customizable [Base Path](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/basePath), which is better suited for hosting your application on a sub-path like `/docs`. We do not suggest you use a custom Asset Prefix for this use case.\n\nTo set up a [CDN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network), you can set up an asset prefix and configure your CDN's origin to resolve to the domain that Next.js is hosted on.\n\nOpen `next.config.js` and add the `assetPrefix` config:\n\n```\nconst isProd = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'\n \nmodule.exports = {\n  // Use the CDN in production and localhost for development.\n  assetPrefix: isProd ? 'https://cdn.mydomain.com' : undefined,\n}\n```\n\nNext.js will automatically use your asset prefix for the JavaScript and CSS files it loads from the `/_next/` path (`.next/static/` folder). For example, with the above configuration, the following request for a JS chunk:\n\n```\n/_next/static/chunks/4b9b41aaa062cbbfeff4add70f256968c51ece5d.4d708494b3aed70c04f0.js\n```\n\nWould instead become:\n\n```\nhttps://cdn.mydomain.com/_next/static/chunks/4b9b41aaa062cbbfeff4add70f256968c51ece5d.4d708494b3aed70c04f0.js\n```\n\nThe exact configuration for uploading your files to a given CDN will depend on your CDN of choice. The only folder you need to host on your CDN is the contents of `.next/static/`, which should be uploaded as `_next/static/` as the above URL request indicates. **Do not upload the rest of your `.next/` folder**, as you should not expose your server code and other configuration to the public.\n\nWhile `assetPrefix` covers requests to `_next/static`, it does not influence the following paths:\n\n*   Files in the [public](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/static-assets) folder; if you want to serve those assets over a CDN, you'll have to introduce the prefix yourself\n*   `/_next/data/` requests for `getServerSideProps` pages. These requests will always be made against the main domain since they're not static.\n*   `/_next/data/` requests for `getStaticProps` pages. These requests will always be made against the main domain to support [Incremental Static Generation](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/incremental-static-regeneration), even if you're not using it (for consistency).",

For features and usage, please see the [Optimizing Fonts](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) page.\n\n### [Font Function Arguments](#font-function-arguments)\n\nFor usage, review [Google Fonts](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts#google-fonts) and [Local Fonts](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts#local-fonts).\n\n| Key | `font/google` | `font/local` | Type | Required |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| [`src`](#src) |     |     | String or Array of Objects | Yes |\n| [`weight`](#weight) |     |     | String or Array | Required/Optional |\n| [`style`](#style) |     |     | String or Array | \\-  |\n| [`subsets`](#subsets) |     |     | Array of Strings | \\-  |\n| [`axes`](#axes) |     |     | Array of Strings | \\-  |\n| [`display`](#display) |     |     | String | \\-  |\n| [`preload`](#preload) |     |     | Boolean | \\-  |\n| [`fallback`](#fallback) |     |     | Array of Strings | \\-  |\n| [`adjustFontFallback`](#adjustfontfallback) |     |     | Boolean or String | \\-  |\n| [`variable`](#variable) |     |     | String | \\-  |\n| [`declarations`](#declarations) |     |     | Array of Objects | \\-  |\n\n### [`src`](#src)\n\nThe path of the font file as a string or an array of objects (with type `Array<{path: string, weight?: string, style?: string}>`) relative to the directory where the font loader function is called.\n\nUsed in `next/font/local`\n\n*   Required\n\nExamples:\n\n*   `src:'./fonts/my-font.woff2'` where `my-font.woff2` is placed in a directory named `fonts` inside the `app` directory\n*   `src:[{path: './inter/Inter-Thin.ttf', weight: '100',},{path: './inter/Inter-Regular.ttf',weight: '400',},{path: './inter/Inter-Bold-Italic.ttf', weight: '700',style: 'italic',},]`\n*   if the font loader function is called in `app/page.tsx` using `src:'../styles/fonts/my-font.ttf'`, then `my-font.ttf` is placed in `styles/fonts` at the root of the project\n\n### [`weight`](#weight)\n\nThe font [`weight`](https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/glossary/weight) with the following possibilities:\n\n*   A string with possible values of the weights available for the specific font or a range of values if it's a [variable](https://fonts.google.com/variablefonts) font\n*   An array of weight values if the font is not a [variable google font](https://fonts.google.com/variablefonts). It applies to `next/font/google` only.\n\nUsed in `next/font/google` and `next/font/local`\n\n*   Required if the font being used is **not** [variable](https://fonts.google.com/variablefonts)\n\nExamples:\n\n*   `weight: '400'`: A string for a single weight value - for the font [`Inter`](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter?query=inter), the possible values are `'100'`, `'200'`, `'300'`, `'400'`, `'500'`, `'600'`, `'700'`, `'800'`, `'900'` or `'variable'` where `'variable'` is the default)\n*   `weight: '100 900'`: A string for the range between `100` and `900` for a variable font\n*   `weight: ['100','400','900']`: An array of 3 possible values for a non variable font\n\n### [`style`](#style)\n\nThe font [`style`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/font-style) with the following possibilities:\n\n*   A string [value](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/font-style#values) with default value of `'normal'`\n*   An array of style values if the font is not a [variable google font](https://fonts.google.com/variablefonts). It applies to `next/font/google` only.\n\nUsed in `next/font/google` and `next/font/local`\n\n*   Optional\n\nExamples:\n\n*   `style: 'italic'`: A string - it can be `normal` or `italic` for `next/font/google`\n*   `style: 'oblique'`: A string - it can take any value for `next/font/local` but is expected to come from [standard font styles](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/font-style)\n*   `style: ['italic','normal']`: An array of 2 values for `next/font/google` - the values are from `normal` and `italic`\n\n### [`subsets`](#subsets)\n\nThe font [`subsets`](https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/glossary/subsetting) defined by an array of string values with the names of each subset you would like to be [preloaded](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts#specifying-a-subset). Fonts specified via `subsets` will have a link preload tag injected into the head when the [`preload`](#preload) option is true, which is the default.\n\nUsed in `next/font/google`\n\n*   Optional\n\nExamples:\n\n*   `subsets: ['latin']`: An array with the subset `latin`\n\nYou can find a list of all subsets on the Google Fonts page for your font.\n\n### [`axes`](#axes)\n\nSome variable fonts have extra `axes` that can be included. By default, only the font weight is included to keep the file size down. The possible values of `axes` depend on the specific font.\n\nUsed in `next/font/google`\n\n*   Optional\n\nExamples:\n\n*   `axes: ['slnt']`: An array with value `slnt` for the `Inter` variable font which has `slnt` as additional `axes` as shown [here](https://fonts.google.com/variablefonts?vfquery=inter#font-families). You can find the possible `axes` values for your font by using the filter on the [Google variable fonts page](https://fonts.google.com/variablefonts#font-families) and looking for axes other than `wght`\n\n### [`display`](#display)\n\nThe font [`display`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/@font-face/font-display) with possible string [values](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/@font-face/font-display#values) of `'auto'`, `'block'`, `'swap'`, `'fallback'` or `'optional'` with default value of `'swap'`.\n\nUsed in `next/font/google` and `next/font/local`\n\n*   Optional\n\nExamples:\n\n*   `display: 'optional'`: A string assigned to the `optional` value\n\n### [`preload`](#preload)\n\nA boolean value that specifies whether the font should be [preloaded](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts#preloading) or not.

Therefore, if you need to use the same font in multiple places, you should load it in one place and import the related font object where you need it. This is done using a font definitions file.\n\nFor example, create a `fonts.ts` file in a `styles` folder at the root of your app directory.\n\nThen, specify your font definitions as follows:\n\n```\nimport { Inter, Lora, Source_Sans_3 } from 'next/font/google'\nimport localFont from 'next/font/local'\n \n// define your variable fonts\nconst inter = Inter()\nconst lora = Lora()\n// define 2 weights of a non-variable font\nconst sourceCodePro400 = Source_Sans_3({ weight: '400' })\nconst sourceCodePro700 = Source_Sans_3({ weight: '700' })\n// define a custom local font where GreatVibes-Regular.ttf is stored in the styles folder\nconst greatVibes = localFont({ src: './GreatVibes-Regular.ttf' })\n \nexport { inter, lora, sourceCodePro400, sourceCodePro700, greatVibes }\n```\n\nYou can now use these definitions in your code as follows:\n\n```\nimport { inter, lora, sourceCodePro700, greatVibes } from '../styles/fonts'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <p className={inter.className}>Hello world using Inter font</p>\n      <p style={lora.style}>Hello world using Lora font</p>\n      <p className={sourceCodePro700.className}>\n        Hello world using Source_Sans_3 font with weight 700\n      </p>\n      <p className={greatVibes.className}>My title in Great Vibes font</p>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nTo make it easier to access the font definitions in your code, you can define a path alias in your `tsconfig.json` or `jsconfig.json` files as follows:\n\n```\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"paths\": {\n      \"@/fonts\": [\"./styles/fonts\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nYou can now import any font definition as follows:\n\n```\nimport { greatVibes, sourceCodePro400 } from '@/fonts'\n```\n\n## [Version Changes](#version-changes)\n\n| Version | Changes |\n| --- | --- |\n| `v13.2.0` | `@next/font` renamed to `next/font`. Installation no longer required. |\n| `v13.0.0` | `@next/font` was added. |",

This is an optimization for applications that do not have compression configured.

For example, if the browser made a request to `POST /v1/users` which returned status code `302` with location `/v2/users`, the subsequent request might be `GET /v2/users` instead of the expected `POST /v2/users`. Next.js uses the 307 temporary redirect, and 308 permanent redirect status codes to explicitly preserve the request method used.\n\n*   `basePath`: `false` or `undefined` - if false the `basePath` won't be included when matching, can be used for external redirects only.\n*   `locale`: `false` or `undefined` - whether the locale should not be included when matching.\n*   `has` is an array of [has objects](#header-cookie-and-query-matching) with the `type`, `key` and `value` properties.\n*   `missing` is an array of [missing objects](#header-cookie-and-query-matching) with the `type`, `key` and `value` properties.\n\nRedirects are checked before the filesystem which includes pages and `/public` files.\n\nWhen using the Pages Router, redirects are not applied to client-side routing (`Link`, `router.push`) unless [Middleware](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware) is present and matches the path.\n\nWhen a redirect is applied, any query values provided in the request will be passed through to the redirect destination. For example, see the following redirect configuration:\n\n```\n{\n  source: '/old-blog/:path*',\n  destination: '/blog/:path*',\n  permanent: false\n}\n```\n\nWhen `/old-blog/post-1?hello=world` is requested, the client will be redirected to `/blog/post-1?hello=world`.\n\n## [Path Matching](#path-matching)\n\nPath matches are allowed, for example `/old-blog/:slug` will match `/old-blog/hello-world` (no nested paths):\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  async redirects() {\n    return [\n      {\n        source: '/old-blog/:slug',\n        destination: '/news/:slug', // Matched parameters can be used in the destination\n        permanent: true,\n      },\n    ]\n  },\n}\n```\n\n### [Wildcard Path Matching](#wildcard-path-matching)\n\nTo match a wildcard path you can use `*` after a parameter, for example `/blog/:slug*` will match `/blog/a/b/c/d/hello-world`:\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  async redirects() {\n    return [\n      {\n        source: '/blog/:slug*',\n        destination: '/news/:slug*', // Matched parameters can be used in the destination\n        permanent: true,\n      },\n    ]\n  },\n}\n```\n\n### [Regex Path Matching](#regex-path-matching)\n\nTo match a regex path you can wrap the regex in parentheses after a parameter, for example `/post/:slug(\\\\d{1,})` will match `/post/123` but not `/post/abc`:\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  async redirects() {\n    return [\n      {\n        source: '/post/:slug(\\\\d{1,})',\n        destination: '/news/:slug', // Matched parameters can be used in the destination\n        permanent: false,\n      },\n    ]\n  },\n}\n```\n\nThe following characters `(`, `)`, `{`, `}`, `:`, `*`, `+`, `?` are used for regex path matching, so when used in the `source` as non-special values they must be escaped by adding `\\\\` before them:\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  async redirects() {\n    return [\n      {\n        // this will match `/english(default)/something` being requested\n        source: '/english\\\\(default\\\\)/:slug',\n        destination: '/en-us/:slug',\n        permanent: false,\n      },\n    ]\n  },\n}\n```\n\n## [Header, Cookie, and Query Matching](#header-cookie-and-query-matching)\n\nTo only match a redirect when header, cookie, or query values also match the `has` field or don't match the `missing` field can be used. Both the `source` and all `has` items must match and all `missing` items must not match for the redirect to be applied.\n\n`has` and `missing` items can have the following fields:\n\n*   `type`: `String` - must be either `header`, `cookie`, `host`, or `query`.\n*   `key`: `String` - the key from the selected type to match against.\n*   `value`: `String` or `undefined` - the value to check for, if undefined any value will match. A regex like string can be used to capture a specific part of the value, e.g. if the value `first-(?<paramName>.*)` is used for `first-second` then `second` will be usable in the destination with `:paramName`.\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  async redirects() {\n    return [\n      // if the header `x-redirect-me` is present,\n      // this redirect will be applied\n      {\n        source: '/:path((?!another-page$).*)',\n        has: [\n          {\n            type: 'header',\n            key: 'x-redirect-me',\n          },\n        ],\n        permanent: false,\n        destination: '/another-page',\n      },\n      // if the header `x-dont-redirect` is present,\n      // this redirect will NOT be applied\n      {\n        source: '/:path((?!another-page$).*)',\n        missing: [\n          {\n            type: 'header',\n            key: 'x-do-not-redirect',\n          },\n        ],\n        permanent: false,\n        destination: '/another-page',\n      },\n      // if the source, query, and cookie are matched,\n      // this redirect will be applied\n      {\n        source: '/specific/:path*',\n        has: [\n          {\n            type: 'query',\n            key: 'page',\n            // the page value will not be available in the\n            // destination since value is provided and doesn't\n            // use a named capture group e.g. (?<page>home)\n            value: 'home',\n          },\n          {\n            type: 'cookie',\n            key: 'authorized',\n            value: 'true',\n          },\n        ],\n        permanent: false,\n        destination: '/another/:path*',\n      },\n      // if the header `x-authorized` is present and\n      // contains a matching value, this redirect will be applied\n      {\n        source: '/',\n        has: [\n          {\n            type: 'header',\n            key: 'x-authorized',\n            value: '(?<authorized>yes|true)',\n          },\n        ],\n        permanent: false,\n        destination: '/home?authorized=:authorized',\n      },\n      // if the host is `example.com`,\n      // this redirect will be applied\n      {\n        source: '/:path((?!another-page$).*)',\n        has: [\n          {\n            type: 'host',\n            value: 'example.com',\n          },\n        ],\n        permanent: false,\n        destination: '/another-page',\n      },\n    ]\n  },\n}\n```\n\n### [Redirects with basePath support](#redirects-with-basepath-support)\n\nWhen leveraging [`basePath` support](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/basePath) with redirects each `source` and `destination` is automatically prefixed with the `basePath` unless you add `basePath: false` to the redirect:\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  basePath: '/docs',\n \n  async redirects() {\n    return [\n      {\n        source: '/with-basePath', // automatically becomes /docs/with-basePath\n        destination: '/another', // automatically becomes /docs/another\n        permanent: false,\n      },\n      {\n        // does not add /docs since basePath: false is set\n        source: '/without-basePath',\n        destination: 'https://example.com',\n        basePath: false,\n        permanent: false,\n      },\n    ]\n  },\n}\n```\n\n### [Redirects with i18n support](#redirects-with-i18n-support)\n\nWhen leveraging [`i18n` support](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/internationalization) with redirects each `source` and `destination` is automatically prefixed to handle the configured `locales` unless you add `locale: false` to the redirect. If `locale: false` is used you must prefix the `source` and `destination` with a locale for it to be matched correctly.\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  i18n: {\n    locales: ['en', 'fr', 'de'],\n    defaultLocale: 'en',\n  },\n \n  async redirects() {\n    return [\n      {\n        source: '/with-locale', // automatically handles all locales\n        destination: '/another', // automatically passes the locale on\n        permanent: false,\n      },\n      {\n        // does not handle locales automatically since locale: false is set\n        source: '/nl/with-locale-manual',\n        destination: '/nl/another',\n        locale: false,\n        permanent: false,\n      },\n      {\n        // this matches '/' since `en` is the defaultLocale\n        source: '/en',\n        destination: '/en/another',\n        locale: false,\n        permanent: false,\n      },\n      // it's possible to match all locales even when locale: false is set\n      {\n        source: '/:locale/page',\n        destination: '/en/newpage',\n        permanent: false,\n        locale: false,\n      },\n      {\n        // this gets converted to /(en|fr|de)/(.*) so will not match the top-level\n        // `/` or `/fr` routes like /:path* would\n        source: '/(.*)',\n        destination: '/another',\n        permanent: false,\n      },\n    ]\n  },\n}\n```\n\nIn some rare cases, you might need to assign a custom status code for older HTTP Clients to properly redirect. In these cases, you can use the `statusCode` property instead of the `permanent` property, but not both. To to ensure IE11 compatibility, a `Refresh` header is automatically added for the 308 status code.\n\n## [Other Redirects](#other-redirects)\n\n*   Inside [API Routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) and [Route Handlers](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-handlers), you can redirect based on the incoming request.\n*   Inside [`getStaticProps`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-static-props) and [`getServerSideProps`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-server-side-props), you can redirect specific pages at request-time.\n\n## [Version History](#version-history)\n\n| Version | Changes |\n| --- | --- |\n| `v13.3.0` | `missing` added. |\n| `v10.2.0` | `has` added. |\n| `v9.5.0` | `redirects` added. |",

    "markdown": "# next.config.js Options: env | Next.js\n\n> Since the release of [Next.js 9.4](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-9-4) we now have a more intuitive and ergonomic experience for [adding environment variables](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/environment-variables). Give it a try!\n\n> **Good to know**: environment variables specified in this way will **always** be included in the JavaScript bundle, prefixing the environment variable name with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` only has an effect when specifying them [through the environment or .env files](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/environment-variables).\n\nTo add environment variables to the JavaScript bundle, open `next.config.js` and add the `env` config:\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  env: {\n    customKey: 'my-value',\n  },\n}\n```\n\nNow you can access `process.env.customKey` in your code. For example:\n\n```\nfunction Page() {\n  return <h1>The value of customKey is: {process.env.customKey}</h1>\n}\n \nexport default Page\n```\n\nNext.js will replace `process.env.customKey` with `'my-value'` at build time. Trying to destructure `process.env` variables won't work due to the nature of webpack [DefinePlugin](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/define-plugin/).\n\nFor example, the following line:\n\n```\nreturn <h1>The value of customKey is: {process.env.customKey}</h1>\n```\n\nWill end up being:\n\n```\nreturn <h1>The value of customKey is: {'my-value'}</h1>\n```",

To opt-in to Strict Mode, configure the following option in your `next.config.js`:\n\nIf you or your team are not ready to use Strict Mode in your entire application, that's OK!

    "markdown": "# next.config.js Options: rewrites | Next.js\n\nRewrites allow you to map an incoming request path to a different destination path.\n\nRewrites act as a URL proxy and mask the destination path, making it appear the user hasn't changed their location on the site. In contrast, [redirects](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/next-config-js/redirects) will reroute to a new page and show the URL changes.\n\nTo use rewrites you can use the `rewrites` key in `next.config.js`:\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  async rewrites() {\n    return [\n      {\n        source: '/about',\n        destination: '/',\n      },\n    ]\n  },\n}\n```\n\nRewrites are applied to client-side routing, a `<Link href=\"/about\">` will have the rewrite applied in the above example.\n\n`rewrites` is an async function that expects to return either an array or an object of arrays (see below) holding objects with `source` and `destination` properties:\n\n*   `source`: `String` - is the incoming request path pattern.\n*   `destination`: `String` is the path you want to route to.\n*   `basePath`: `false` or `undefined` - if false the basePath won't be included when matching, can be used for external rewrites only.\n*   `locale`: `false` or `undefined` - whether the locale should not be included when matching.\n*   `has` is an array of [has objects](#header-cookie-and-query-matching) with the `type`, `key` and `value` properties.\n*   `missing` is an array of [missing objects](#header-cookie-and-query-matching) with the `type`, `key` and `value` properties.\n\nWhen the `rewrites` function returns an array, rewrites are applied after checking the filesystem (pages and `/public` files) and before dynamic routes. When the `rewrites` function returns an object of arrays with a specific shape, this behavior can be changed and more finely controlled, as of `v10.1` of Next.js:\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  async rewrites() {\n    return {\n      beforeFiles: [\n        // These rewrites are checked after headers/redirects\n        // and before all files including _next/public files which\n        // allows overriding page files\n        {\n          source: '/some-page',\n          destination: '/somewhere-else',\n          has: [{ type: 'query', key: 'overrideMe' }],\n        },\n      ],\n      afterFiles: [\n        // These rewrites are checked after pages/public files\n        // are checked but before dynamic routes\n        {\n          source: '/non-existent',\n          destination: '/somewhere-else',\n        },\n      ],\n      fallback: [\n        // These rewrites are checked after both pages/public files\n        // and dynamic routes are checked\n        {\n          source: '/:path*',\n          destination: `https://my-old-site.com/:path*`,\n        },\n      ],\n    }\n  },\n}\n```\n\n> **Good to know**: rewrites in `beforeFiles` do not check the filesystem/dynamic routes immediately after matching a source, they continue until all `beforeFiles` have been checked.\n\nThe order Next.js routes are checked is:\n\n1.

If you use [fallback: true/'blocking'](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/get-static-paths#fallback-true) in `getStaticPaths`, the fallback `rewrites` defined in your `next.config.js` will _not_ be run.\n\n## [Rewrite parameters](#rewrite-parameters)\n\nWhen using parameters in a rewrite the parameters will be passed in the query by default when none of the parameters are used in the `destination`.\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  async rewrites() {\n    return [\n      {\n        source: '/old-about/:path*',\n        destination: '/about', // The :path parameter isn't used here so will be automatically passed in the query\n      },\n    ]\n  },\n}\n```\n\nIf a parameter is used in the destination none of the parameters will be automatically passed in the query.\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  async rewrites() {\n    return [\n      {\n        source: '/docs/:path*',\n        destination: '/:path*', // The :path parameter is used here so will not be automatically passed in the query\n      },\n    ]\n  },\n}\n```\n\nYou can still pass the parameters manually in the query if one is already used in the destination by specifying the query in the `destination`.\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  async rewrites() {\n    return [\n      {\n        source: '/:first/:second',\n        destination: '/:first?second=:second',\n        // Since the :first parameter is used in the destination the :second parameter\n        // will not automatically be added in the query although we can manually add it\n        // as shown above\n      },\n    ]\n  },\n}\n```\n\n> **Good to know**: Static pages from [Automatic Static Optimization](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/rendering/automatic-static-optimization) or [prerendering](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-static-props) params from rewrites will be parsed on the client after hydration and provided in the query.\n\n## [Path Matching](#path-matching)\n\nPath matches are allowed, for example `/blog/:slug` will match `/blog/hello-world` (no nested paths):\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  async rewrites() {\n    return [\n      {\n        source: '/blog/:slug',\n        destination: '/news/:slug', // Matched parameters can be used in the destination\n      },\n    ]\n  },\n}\n```\n\n### [Wildcard Path Matching](#wildcard-path-matching)\n\nTo match a wildcard path you can use `*` after a parameter, for example `/blog/:slug*` will match `/blog/a/b/c/d/hello-world`:\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  async rewrites() {\n    return [\n      {\n        source: '/blog/:slug*',\n        destination: '/news/:slug*', // Matched parameters can be used in the destination\n      },\n    ]\n  },\n}\n```\n\n### [Regex Path Matching](#regex-path-matching)\n\nTo match a regex path you can wrap the regex in parenthesis after a parameter, for example `/blog/:slug(\\\\d{1,})` will match `/blog/123` but not `/blog/abc`:\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  async rewrites() {\n    return [\n      {\n        source: '/old-blog/:post(\\\\d{1,})',\n        destination: '/blog/:post', // Matched parameters can be used in the destination\n      },\n    ]\n  },\n}\n```\n\nThe following characters `(`, `)`, `{`, `}`, `[`, `]`, `|`, `\\`, `^`, `.`, `:`, `*`, `+`, `-`, `?`, `$` are used for regex path matching, so when used in the `source` as non-special values they must be escaped by adding `\\\\` before them:\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  async rewrites() {\n    return [\n      {\n        // this will match `/english(default)/something` being requested\n        source: '/english\\\\(default\\\\)/:slug',\n        destination: '/en-us/:slug',\n      },\n    ]\n  },\n}\n```\n\n## [Header, Cookie, and Query Matching](#header-cookie-and-query-matching)\n\nTo only match a rewrite when header, cookie, or query values also match the `has` field or don't match the `missing` field can be used. Both the `source` and all `has` items must match and all `missing` items must not match for the rewrite to be applied.\n\n`has` and `missing` items can have the following fields:\n\n*   `type`: `String` - must be either `header`, `cookie`, `host`, or `query`.\n*   `key`: `String` - the key from the selected type to match against.\n*   `value`: `String` or `undefined` - the value to check for, if undefined any value will match. A regex like string can be used to capture a specific part of the value, e.g. if the value `first-(?<paramName>.*)` is used for `first-second` then `second` will be usable in the destination with `:paramName`.\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  async rewrites() {\n    return [\n      // if the header `x-rewrite-me` is present,\n      // this rewrite will be applied\n      {\n        source: '/:path*',\n        has: [\n          {\n            type: 'header',\n            key: 'x-rewrite-me',\n          },\n        ],\n        destination: '/another-page',\n      },\n      // if the header `x-rewrite-me` is not present,\n      // this rewrite will be applied\n      {\n        source: '/:path*',\n        missing: [\n          {\n            type: 'header',\n            key: 'x-rewrite-me',\n          },\n        ],\n        destination: '/another-page',\n      },\n      // if the source, query, and cookie are matched,\n      // this rewrite will be applied\n      {\n        source: '/specific/:path*',\n        has: [\n          {\n            type: 'query',\n            key: 'page',\n            // the page value will not be available in the\n            // destination since value is provided and doesn't\n            // use a named capture group e.g. (?<page>home)\n            value: 'home',\n          },\n          {\n            type: 'cookie',\n            key: 'authorized',\n            value: 'true',\n          },\n        ],\n        destination: '/:path*/home',\n      },\n      // if the header `x-authorized` is present and\n      // contains a matching value, this rewrite will be applied\n      {\n        source: '/:path*',\n        has: [\n          {\n            type: 'header',\n            key: 'x-authorized',\n            value: '(?<authorized>yes|true)',\n          },\n        ],\n        destination: '/home?authorized=:authorized',\n      },\n      // if the host is `example.com`,\n      // this rewrite will be applied\n      {\n        source: '/:path*',\n        has: [\n          {\n            type: 'host',\n            value: 'example.com',\n          },\n        ],\n        destination: '/another-page',\n      },\n    ]\n  },\n}\n```\n\n## [Rewriting to an external URL](#rewriting-to-an-external-url)\n\nExamples\n\n*   [Incremental adoption of Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/custom-routes-proxying)\n*   [Using Multiple Zones](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-zones)\n\nRewrites allow you to rewrite to an external url. This is especially useful for incrementally adopting Next.js. The following is an example rewrite for redirecting the `/blog` route of your main app to an external site.\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  async rewrites() {\n    return [\n      {\n        source: '/blog',\n        destination: 'https://example.com/blog',\n      },\n      {\n        source: '/blog/:slug',\n        destination: 'https://example.com/blog/:slug', // Matched parameters can be used in the destination\n      },\n    ]\n  },\n}\n```\n\nIf you're using `trailingSlash: true`, you also need to insert a trailing slash in the `source` parameter. If the destination server is also expecting a trailing slash it should be included in the `destination` parameter as well.\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  trailingSlash: true,\n  async rewrites() {\n    return [\n      {\n        source: '/blog/',\n        destination: 'https://example.com/blog/',\n      },\n      {\n        source: '/blog/:path*/',\n        destination: 'https://example.com/blog/:path*/',\n      },\n    ]\n  },\n}\n```\n\n### [Incremental adoption of Next.js](#incremental-adoption-of-nextjs)\n\nYou can also have Next.js fall back to proxying to an existing website after checking all Next.js routes.\n\nThis way you don't have to change the rewrites configuration when migrating more pages to Next.js\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  async rewrites() {\n    return {\n      fallback: [\n        {\n          source: '/:path*',\n          destination: `https://custom-routes-proxying-endpoint.vercel.app/:path*`,\n        },\n      ],\n    }\n  },\n}\n```\n\n### [Rewrites with basePath support](#rewrites-with-basepath-support)\n\nWhen leveraging [`basePath` support](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/basePath) with rewrites each `source` and `destination` is automatically prefixed with the `basePath` unless you add `basePath: false` to the rewrite:\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  basePath: '/docs',\n \n  async rewrites() {\n    return [\n      {\n        source: '/with-basePath', // automatically becomes /docs/with-basePath\n        destination: '/another', // automatically becomes /docs/another\n      },\n      {\n        // does not add /docs to /without-basePath since basePath: false is set\n        // Note: this can not be used for internal rewrites e.g. `destination: '/another'`\n        source: '/without-basePath',\n        destination: 'https://example.com',\n        basePath: false,\n      },\n    ]\n  },\n}\n```\n\n### [Rewrites with i18n support](#rewrites-with-i18n-support)\n\nWhen leveraging [`i18n` support](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/internationalization) with rewrites each `source` and `destination` is automatically prefixed to handle the configured `locales` unless you add `locale: false` to the rewrite. If `locale: false` is used you must prefix the `source` and `destination` with a locale for it to be matched correctly.\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  i18n: {\n    locales: ['en', 'fr', 'de'],\n    defaultLocale: 'en',\n  },\n \n  async rewrites() {\n    return [\n      {\n        source: '/with-locale', // automatically handles all locales\n        destination: '/another', // automatically passes the locale on\n      },\n      {\n        // does not handle locales automatically since locale: false is set\n        source: '/nl/with-locale-manual',\n        destination: '/nl/another',\n        locale: false,\n      },\n      {\n        // this matches '/' since `en` is the defaultLocale\n        source: '/en',\n        destination: '/en/another',\n        locale: false,\n      },\n      {\n        // it's possible to match all locales even when locale: false is set\n        source: '/:locale/api-alias/:path*',\n        destination: '/api/:path*',\n        locale: false,\n      },\n      {\n        // this gets converted to /(en|fr|de)/(.*) so will not match the top-level\n        // `/` or `/fr` routes like /:path* would\n        source: '/(.*)',\n        destination: '/another',\n      },\n    ]\n  },\n}\n```\n\n## [Version History](#version-history)\n\n| Version | Changes |\n| --- | --- |\n| `v13.3.0` | `missing` added. |\n| `v10.2.0` | `has` added. |\n| `v9.5.0` | Headers added. |",

    "markdown": "# next.config.js Options: urlImports | Next.js\n\nURL imports are an experimental feature that allows you to import modules directly from external servers (instead of from the local disk).\n\n> **Warning**: This feature is experimental. Only use domains that you trust to download and execute on your machine. Please exercise discretion, and caution until the feature is flagged as stable.\n\nTo opt-in, add the allowed URL prefixes inside `next.config.js`:\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  experimental: {\n    urlImports: ['https://example.com/assets/', 'https://cdn.skypack.dev'],\n  },\n}\n```\n\nThen, you can import modules directly from URLs:\n\n```\nimport { a, b, c } from 'https://example.com/assets/some/module.js'\n```\n\nURL Imports can be used everywhere normal package imports can be used.\n\n## [Security Model](#security-model)\n\nThis feature is being designed with **security as the top priority**. To start, we added an experimental flag forcing you to explicitly allow the domains you accept URL imports from. We're working to take this further by limiting URL imports to execute in the browser sandbox using the [Edge Runtime](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/edge).\n\n## [Lockfile](#lockfile)\n\nWhen using URL imports, Next.js will create a `next.lock` directory containing a lockfile and fetched assets. This directory **must be committed to Git**, not ignored by `.gitignore`.\n\n*   When running `next dev`, Next.js will download and add all newly discovered URL Imports to your lockfile\n*   When running `next build`, Next.js will use only the lockfile to build the application for production\n\nTypically, no network requests are needed and any outdated lockfile will cause the build to fail. One exception is resources that respond with `Cache-Control: no-cache`. These resources will have a `no-cache` entry in the lockfile and will always be fetched from the network on each build.\n\n## [Examples](#examples)\n\n### [Skypack](#skypack)\n\n```\nimport confetti from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/canvas-confetti'\nimport { useEffect } from 'react'\n \nexport default () => {\n  useEffect(() => {\n    confetti()\n  })\n  return <p>Hello</p>\n}\n```\n\n### [Static Image Imports](#static-image-imports)\n\n```\nimport Image from 'next/image'\nimport logo from 'https://example.com/assets/logo.png'\n \nexport default () => (\n  <div>\n    <Image src={logo} placeholder=\"blur\" />\n  </div>\n)\n```\n\n### [URLs in CSS](#urls-in-css)\n\n```\n.className {\n  background: url('https://example.com/assets/hero.jpg');\n}\n```\n\n### [Asset Imports](#asset-imports)\n\n```\nconst logo = new URL('https://example.com/assets/file.txt', import.meta.url)\n \nconsole.log(logo.pathname)\n \n// prints \"/_next/static/media/file.a9727b5d.txt\"\n```",

    "markdown": "# next.config.js Options: turbo | Next.js\n\n## turbo (experimental)\n\nTurbopack can be customized to transform different files and change how modules are resolved.\n\n> **Good to know**:\n> \n> *   These features are experimental and will only work with `next --turbo`.\n> *   Turbopack for Next.js does not require loaders nor loader configuration for built-in functionality. Turbopack has built-in support for css and compiling modern JavaScript, so there's no need for `css-loader`, `postcss-loader`, or `babel-loader` if you're using `@babel/preset-env`.\n\n## [webpack loaders](#webpack-loaders)\n\nIf you need loader support beyond what's built in, many webpack loaders already work with Turbopack. There are currently some limitations:\n\n*   Only a core subset of the webpack loader API is implemented. Currently, there is enough coverage for some popular loaders, and we'll expand our API support in the future.\n*   Only loaders that return JavaScript code are supported. Loaders that transform files like stylesheets or images are not currently supported.\n*   Options passed to webpack loaders must be plain JavaScript primitives, objects, and arrays. For example, it's not possible to pass `require()`d plugin modules as option values.\n\nTo configure loaders, add the names of the loaders you've installed and any options in `next.config.js`, mapping file extensions to a list of loaders:\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  experimental: {\n    turbo: {\n      rules: {\n        '*.svg': {\n          loaders: ['@svgr/webpack'],\n          as: '*.js',\n        },\n      },\n    },\n  },\n}\n```\n\n> **Good to know**: Prior to Next.js version 13.4.4, `experimental.turbo.rules` was named `experimental.turbo.loaders` and only accepted file extensions like `.mdx` instead of `*.mdx`.\n\n### [Supported loaders](#supported-loaders)\n\nThe following loaders have been tested to work with Turbopack's webpack loader implementation:\n\n*   [`babel-loader`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-loader)\n*   [`@svgr/webpack`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@svgr/webpack)\n*   [`svg-inline-loader`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/svg-inline-loader)\n*   [`yaml-loader`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yaml-loader)\n*   [`string-replace-loader`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/string-replace-loader)\n*   [`raw-loader`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/raw-loader)\n*   ['sass-loader'](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sass-loader)\n\n## [Resolve aliases](#resolve-aliases)\n\nThrough `next.config.js`, Turbopack can be configured to modify module resolution through aliases, similar to webpack's [`resolve.alias`](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/resolve/#resolvealias) configuration.\n\nTo configure resolve aliases, map imported patterns to their new destination in `next.config.js`:\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  experimental: {\n    turbo: {\n      resolveAlias: {\n        underscore: 'lodash',\n        mocha: { browser: 'mocha/browser-entry.js' },\n      },\n    },\n  },\n}\n```\n\nThis aliases imports of the `underscore` package to the `lodash` package. In other words, `import underscore from 'underscore'` will load the `lodash` module instead of `underscore`.\n\nTurbopack also supports conditional aliasing through this field, similar to Node.js's [conditional exports](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v18.x/api/packages.html#conditional-exports). At the moment only the `browser` condition is supported. In the case above, imports of the `mocha` module will be aliased to `mocha/browser-entry.js` when Turbopack targets browser environments.\n\n## [Resolve extensions](#resolve-extensions)\n\nThrough `next.config.js`, Turbopack can be configured to resolve modules with custom extensions, similar to webpack's [`resolve.extensions`](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/resolve/#resolveextensions) configuration.\n\nTo configure resolve extensions, use the `resolveExtensions` field in `next.config.js`:\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  experimental: {\n    turbo: {\n      resolveExtensions: [\n        '.mdx',\n        '.tsx',\n        '.ts',\n        '.jsx',\n        '.js',\n        '.mjs',\n        '.json',\n      ],\n    },\n  },\n}\n```\n\nThis overwrites the original resolve extensions with the provided list. Make sure to include the default extensions.\n\nFor more information and guidance for how to migrate your app to Turbopack from webpack, see [Turbopack's documentation on webpack compatibility](https://turbo.build/pack/docs/migrating-from-webpack).",

This allows you to distinguish between client and server configuration using the `isServer` property.\n\nThe second argument to the `webpack` function is an object with the following properties:\n\n*   `buildId`: `String` - The build id, used as a unique identifier between builds\n*   `dev`: `Boolean` - Indicates if the compilation will be done in development\n*   `isServer`: `Boolean` - It's `true` for server-side compilation, and `false` for client-side compilation\n*   `nextRuntime`: `String | undefined` - The target runtime for server-side compilation; either `\"edge\"` or `\"nodejs\"`, it's `undefined` for client-side compilation.\n*   `defaultLoaders`: `Object` - Default loaders used internally by Next.js:\n    *   `babel`: `Object` - Default `babel-loader` configuration\n\nExample usage of `defaultLoaders.babel`:\n\n```\n// Example config for adding a loader that depends on babel-loader\n// This source was taken from the @next/mdx plugin source:\n// https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/next-mdx\nmodule.exports = {\n  webpack: (config, options) => {\n    config.module.rules.push({\n      test: /\\.mdx/,\n      use: [\n        options.defaultLoaders.babel,\n        {\n          loader: '@mdx-js/loader',\n          options: pluginOptions.options,\n        },\n      ],\n    })\n \n    return config\n  },\n}\n```\n\n#### [`nextRuntime`](#nextruntime)\n\nNotice that `isServer` is `true` when `nextRuntime` is `\"edge\"` or `\"nodejs\"`, nextRuntime \"`edge`\" is currently for middleware and Server Components in edge runtime only.",

For example, in the case of Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS), we might want to know the first element that shifted when the single largest layout shift occurred. Or, in the case of Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), we might want to identify the element corresponding to the LCP for the page. If the LCP element is an image, knowing the URL of the image resource can help us locate the asset we need to optimize.\n\nPinpointing the biggest contributor to the Web Vitals score, aka [attribution](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/web-vitals/blob/4ca38ae64b8d1e899028c692f94d4c56acfc996c/README.md#attribution), allows us to obtain more in-depth information like entries for [PerformanceEventTiming](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/PerformanceEventTiming), [PerformanceNavigationTiming](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/PerformanceNavigationTiming) and [PerformanceResourceTiming](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/PerformanceResourceTiming).\n\nAttribution is disabled by default in Next.js but can be enabled **per metric** by specifying the following in `next.config.js`.\n\n```\nexperimental: {\n  webVitalsAttribution: ['CLS', 'LCP']\n}\n```\n\nValid attribution values are all `web-vitals` metrics specified in the [`NextWebVitalsMetric`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/442378d21dd56d6e769863eb8c2cb521a463a2e0/packages/next/shared/lib/utils.ts#L43) type.",

    "markdown": "# API Reference: create-next-app | Next.js\n\nThe easiest way to get started with Next.js is by using `create-next-app`. This CLI tool enables you to quickly start building a new Next.js application, with everything set up for you.\n\nYou can create a new app using the default Next.js template, or by using one of the [official Next.js examples](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples).\n\n### [Interactive](#interactive)\n\nYou can create a new project interactively by running:\n\n```\nnpx create-next-app@latest\n```\n\nYou will then be asked the following prompts:\n\n```\nWhat is your project named?  my-app\nWould you like to use TypeScript?  No / Yes\nWould you like to use ESLint?  No / Yes\nWould you like to use Tailwind CSS?  No / Yes\nWould you like to use `src/` directory?  No / Yes\nWould you like to use App Router? (recommended)  No / Yes\nWould you like to customize the default import alias (@/*)?  No / Yes\n```\n\nOnce you've answered the prompts, a new project will be created with the correct configuration depending on your answers.\n\n### [Non-interactive](#non-interactive)\n\nYou can also pass command line arguments to set up a new project non-interactively.\n\nFurther, you can negate default options by prefixing them with `--no-` (e.g. `--no-eslint`).\n\nSee `create-next-app --help`:\n\n```\nUsage: create-next-app <project-directory> [options]\n \nOptions:\n  -V, --version                        output the version number\n  --ts, --typescript\n \n    Initialize as a TypeScript project. (default)\n \n  --js, --javascript\n \n    Initialize as a JavaScript project.\n \n  --tailwind\n \n    Initialize with Tailwind CSS config. (default)\n \n  --eslint\n \n    Initialize with ESLint config.\n \n  --app\n \n    Initialize as an App Router project.\n \n  --src-dir\n \n    Initialize inside a `src/` directory.\n \n  --import-alias <alias-to-configure>\n \n    Specify import alias to use (default \"@/*\").\n \n  --use-npm\n \n    Explicitly tell the CLI to bootstrap the app using npm\n \n  --use-pnpm\n \n    Explicitly tell the CLI to bootstrap the app using pnpm\n \n  --use-yarn\n \n    Explicitly tell the CLI to bootstrap the app using Yarn\n \n  --use-bun\n \n    Explicitly tell the CLI to bootstrap the app using Bun\n \n  -e, --example [name]|[github-url]\n \n    An example to bootstrap the app with. You can use an example name\n    from the official Next.js repo or a public GitHub URL. The URL can use\n    any branch and/or subdirectory\n \n  --example-path <path-to-example>\n \n    In a rare case, your GitHub URL might contain a branch name with\n    a slash (e.g. bug/fix-1) and the path to the example (e.g. foo/bar).\n    In this case, you must specify the path to the example separately:\n    --example-path foo/bar\n \n  --reset-preferences\n \n    Explicitly tell the CLI to reset any stored preferences\n \n  -h, --help                           output usage information\n```\n\n### [Why use Create Next App?](#why-use-create-next-app)\n\n`create-next-app` allows you to create a new Next.js app within seconds. It is officially maintained by the creators of Next.js, and includes a number of benefits:\n\n*   **Interactive Experience**: Running `npx create-next-app@latest` (with no arguments) launches an interactive experience that guides you through setting up a project.\n*   **Zero Dependencies**: Initializing a project is as quick as one second. Create Next App has zero dependencies.\n*   **Offline Support**: Create Next App will automatically detect if you're offline and bootstrap your project using your local package cache.\n*   **Support for Examples**: Create Next App can bootstrap your application using an example from the Next.js examples collection (e.g. `npx create-next-app --example api-routes`) or any public GitHub repository.\n*   **Tested**: The package is part of the Next.js monorepo and tested using the same integration test suite as Next.js itself, ensuring it works as expected with every release.",

By adding accessibility features to Next.js by default, we aim to make the Web more inclusive for everyone.\n\n## [Route Announcements](#route-announcements)\n\nWhen transitioning between pages rendered on the server (e.g. using the `<a href>` tag) screen readers and other assistive technology announce the page title when the page loads so that users understand that the page has changed.\n\nIn addition to traditional page navigations, Next.js also supports client-side transitions for improved performance (using `next/link`). To ensure that client-side transitions are also announced to assistive technology, Next.js includes a route announcer by default.\n\nThe Next.js route announcer looks for the page name to announce by first inspecting `document.title`, then the `<h1>` element, and finally the URL pathname. For the most accessible user experience, ensure that each page in your application has a unique and descriptive title.\n\n## [Linting](#linting)\n\nNext.js provides an [integrated ESLint experience](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/eslint) out of the box, including custom rules for Next.js.

The default port can be changed with `-p`, like so:\n\nOr using the `PORT` environment variable:\n\n> **Good to know**:\n> \n> *   `PORT` cannot be set in `.env` as booting up the HTTP server happens before any other code is initialized.\n> *   Next.js will automatically retry with another port until a port is available if a port is not specified with the CLI option `--port` or the `PORT` environment variable.\n\nYou can also set the hostname to be different from the default of `0.0.0.0`, this can be useful for making the application available for other devices on the network. The default hostname can be changed with `-H`, like so:\n\n### [Turbopack](#turbopack)\n\n[Turbopack](https://nextjs.org/docs/architecture/turbopack) (beta), our new bundler, which is being tested and stabilized in Next.js, helps speed up local iterations while working on your application.\n\nTo use Turbopack in development mode, add the `--turbo` option:\n\n### [HTTPS for Local Development](#https-for-local-development)\n\nFor certain use cases like webhooks or authentication, it may be required to use HTTPS to have a secure environment on `localhost`. Next.js can generate a self-signed certificate with `next dev` as follows:\n\n```\nnext dev --experimental-https\n```\n\nYou can also provide a custom certificate and key with `--experimental-https-key` and `--experimental-https-cert`. Optionally, you can provide a custom CA certificate with `--experimental-https-ca` as well.\n\n```\nnext dev --experimental-https --experimental-https-key ./certificates/localhost-key.pem --experimental-https-cert ./certificates/localhost.pem\n```\n\n`next dev --experimental-https` is only intended for development and creates a locally-trusted certificate with `mkcert`. In production, use properly issued certificates from trusted authorities. When deploying to Vercel, HTTPS is [automatically configured](https://vercel.com/docs/security/encryption) for your Next.js application.\n\n## [Build](#build)\n\n`next build` creates an optimized production build of your application. The output displays information about each route:\n\n```\nRoute (app)                               Size     First Load JS\n┌ ○ /                                     5.3 kB         89.5 kB\n├ ○ /_not-found                           885 B          85.1 kB\n└ ○ /about                                137 B          84.4 kB\n+ First Load JS shared by all             84.2 kB\n  ├ chunks/184-d3bb186aac44da98.js        28.9 kB\n  ├ chunks/30b509c0-f3503c24f98f3936.js   53.4 kB\n  └ other shared chunks (total)\n \n \n○  (Static)  prerendered as static content\n```\n\n*   **Size**: The number of assets downloaded when navigating to the page client-side. The size for each route only includes its dependencies.\n*   **First Load JS**: The number of assets downloaded when visiting the page from the server. The amount of JS shared by all is shown as a separate metric.\n\nBoth of these values are [**compressed with gzip**](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/compress). The first load is indicated by green, yellow, or red. Aim for green for performant applications.\n\nTo get a list of the available options with `next build`, run the following command inside your project directory:\n\nThe output should look like this:\n\n```\nUsage: next build [directory] [options]\n \nCreates an optimized production build of your application. The output displays information\nabout each route.\n \nArguments:\n  [directory]                       A directory on which to build the application.

The application should be compiled with [`next build`](#build) first.\n\nTo get a list of the available options with `next start`, run the follow command inside your project directory:\n\nThe output should look like this:\n\n```\nUsage: next start [directory] [options]\n \nStarts Next.js in production mode. The application should be compiled with `next build`\nfirst.\n \nArguments:\n  [directory]                           A directory on which to start the application.\n                                        If not directory is provided, the current\n                                        directory will be used.\n \nOptions:\n  -p, --port <port>                     Specify a port number on which to start the\n                                        application. (default: 3000, env: PORT)\n  -H, --hostname <hostname>             Specify a hostname on which to start the\n                                        application (default: 0.0.0.0).\n  --keepAliveTimeout <keepAliveTimeout> Specify the maximum amount of milliseconds to wait\n                                        before closing the inactive connections.\n  -h, --help                            Displays this message.\n```\n\nThe application will start at `http://localhost:3000` by default. The default port can be changed with `-p`, like so:\n\nOr using the `PORT` environment variable:\n\n> **Good to know**:\n> \n> *   `PORT` cannot be set in `.env` as booting up the HTTP server happens before any other code is initialized.\n> *   `next start` cannot be used with `output: 'standalone'` or `output: 'export'`.\n\n### [Keep Alive Timeout](#keep-alive-timeout)\n\nWhen deploying Next.js behind a downstream proxy (e.g. a load-balancer like AWS ELB/ALB) it's important to configure Next's underlying HTTP server with [keep-alive timeouts](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_server_keepalivetimeout) that are _larger_ than the downstream proxy's timeouts. Otherwise, once a keep-alive timeout is reached for a given TCP connection, Node.js will immediately terminate that connection without notifying the downstream proxy. This results in a proxy error whenever it attempts to reuse a connection that Node.js has already terminated.\n\nTo configure the timeout values for the production Next.js server, pass `--keepAliveTimeout` (in milliseconds) to `next start`, like so:\n\n```\nnext start --keepAliveTimeout 70000\n```\n\n## [Info](#info)\n\n`next info` prints relevant details about the current system which can be used to report Next.js bugs. This information includes Operating System platform/arch/version, Binaries (Node.js, npm, Yarn, pnpm) and npm package versions (`next`, `react`, `react-dom`).\n\nTo get a list of the available options with `next info`, run the following command inside your project directory:\n\nThe output should look like this:\n\n```\nUsage: next info [options]\n \nPrints relevant details about the current system which can be used to report Next.js bugs.\n \nOptions:\n  --verbose   Collections additional information for debugging.\n  -h, --help  Displays this message.\n```\n\nRunning `next info` will give you information like this example:\n\n```\n \nOperating System:\n  Platform: linux\n  Arch: x64\n  Version: #22-Ubuntu SMP Fri Nov 5 13:21:36 UTC 2021\n  Available memory (MB): 31795\n  Available CPU cores: 16\nBinaries:\n  Node: 16.13.0\n  npm: 8.1.0\n  Yarn: 1.22.17\n  pnpm: 6.24.2\nRelevant Packages:\n  next: 14.1.1-canary.61 // Latest available version is detected (14.1.1-canary.61).\n  react: 18.2.0\n  react-dom: 18.2.0\nNext.js Config:\n  output: N/A\n \n```\n\nThis information should then be pasted into GitHub Issues.\n\nYou can also run `next info --verbose` which will print additional information about the system and the installation of packages related to `next`.\n\n## [Lint](#lint)\n\n`next lint` runs ESLint for all files in the `pages/`, `app/`, `components/`, `lib/`, and `src/` directories. It also provides a guided setup to install any required dependencies if ESLint is not already configured in your application.\n\nTo get a list of the available options with `next lint`, run the following command inside your project directory:\n\nThe output should look like this:\n\n```\nUsage: next lint [directory] [options]\n \nRuns ESLint for all files in the `/src`, `/app`, `/pages`, `/components`, and `/lib` directories.

To enable Turbopack, use the `--turbo` flag when running the Next.js development server.\n\n```\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"dev\": \"next dev --turbo\",\n    \"build\": \"next build\",\n    \"start\": \"next start\",\n    \"lint\": \"next lint\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## [Supported features](#supported-features)\n\nTurbopack in Next.js requires zero-configuration for most users and can be extended for more advanced use cases. To learn more about the currently supported features for Turbopack, view the [API Reference](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/turbo).\n\n## [Unsupported features](#unsupported-features)\n\nTurbopack currently only supports `next dev` and does not support `next build`. We are currently working on support for builds as we move closer towards stability.\n\nThese features are currently not supported:\n\n*   [`webpack()`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/webpack) configuration in `next.config.js`\n    *   Turbopack replaces Webpack, this means that webpack configuration is not supported.\n    *   To configure Turbopack, [see the documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/turbo).\n    *   A subset of [Webpack loaders](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/turbo#webpack-loaders) are supported in Turbopack.\n*   Babel (`.babelrc`)\n    *   Turbopack leverages the [SWC](https://nextjs.org/docs/architecture/nextjs-compiler#why-swc) compiler for all transpilation and optimizations. This means that Babel is not included by default.\n    *   If you have a `.babelrc` file, you might no longer need it because Next.js includes common Babel plugins as SWC transforms that can be enabled. You can read more about this in the [compiler documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/architecture/docs/architecture/nextjs-compiler#supported-features).\n    *   If you still need to use Babel after verifying your particular use case is not covered, you can leverage Turbopack's [support for custom webpack loaders](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/turbo#webpack-loaders) to include `babel-loader`.\n*   Creating a root layout automatically in App Router.\n    *   This behavior is currently not supported since it changes input files, instead, an error will be shown for you manually add a root layout in the desired location.\n*   `@next/font` (legacy font support).\n    *   `@next/font` is deprecated in favor of `next/font`. [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) is fully supported with Turbopack.\n*   `new Worker('file', import.meta.url)`.\n    *   We are planning to implement this in the future.\n*   [Relay transforms](https://nextjs.org/docs/architecture/nextjs-compiler#relay)\n    *   We are planning to implement this in the future.\n*   `experimental.nextScriptWorkers`\n    *   We are planning to implement this in the future.\n*   [AMP](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/amp).\n    *   We are currently not planning to support AMP in Next.js with Turbopack.\n*   Yarn PnP\n    *   We are currently not planning to support Yarn PnP in Next.js with Turbopack.\n*   [`experimental.urlImports`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/urlImports)\n    *   We are currently not planning to support `experimental.urlImports` in Next.js with Turbopack.\n\n## [Generating Trace Files](#generating-trace-files)\n\nTrace files allow the Next.js team to investigate and improve performance metrics and memory usage. To generate a trace file, append `NEXT_TURBOPACK_TRACING=1` to the `next dev --turbo` command, this will generate a `.next/trace.log` file.\n\nWhen reporting issues related to Turbopack performance and memory usage, please include the trace file in your [GitHub](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) issue.",

You can edit anything in that file, including styles, rendering logic, event handlers, or effects.\n*   If you edit a file with exports that _aren't_ React components, Fast Refresh will re-run both that file, and the other files importing it. So if both `Button.js` and `Modal.js` import `theme.js`, editing `theme.js` will update both components.\n*   Finally, if you **edit a file** that's **imported by files outside of the React tree**, Fast Refresh **will fall back to doing a full reload**. You might have a file which renders a React component but also exports a value that is imported by a **non-React component**. For example, maybe your component also exports a constant, and a non-React utility file imports it. In that case, consider migrating the constant to a separate file and importing it into both files. This will re-enable Fast Refresh to work. Other cases can usually be solved in a similar way.\n\n## [Error Resilience](#error-resilience)\n\n### [Syntax Errors](#syntax-errors)\n\nIf you make a syntax error during development, you can fix it and save the file again. The error will disappear automatically, so you won't need to reload the app. **You will not lose component state**.\n\n### [Runtime Errors](#runtime-errors)\n\nIf you make a mistake that leads to a runtime error inside your component, you'll be greeted with a contextual overlay. Fixing the error will automatically dismiss the overlay, without reloading the app.\n\nComponent state will be retained if the error did not occur during rendering. If the error did occur during rendering, React will remount your application using the updated code.\n\nIf you have [error boundaries](https://react.dev/reference/react/Component#catching-rendering-errors-with-an-error-boundary) in your app (which is a good idea for graceful failures in production), they will retry rendering on the next edit after a rendering error. This means having an error boundary can prevent you from always getting reset to the root app state. However, keep in mind that error boundaries shouldn't be _too_ granular. They are used by React in production, and should always be designed intentionally.\n\n## [Limitations](#limitations)\n\nFast Refresh tries to preserve local React state in the component you're editing, but only if it's safe to do so. Here's a few reasons why you might see local state being reset on every edit to a file:\n\n*   Local state is not preserved for class components (only function components and Hooks preserve state).\n*   The file you're editing might have _other_ exports in addition to a React component.\n*   Sometimes, a file would export the result of calling a higher-order component like `HOC(WrappedComponent)`. If the returned component is a class, its state will be reset.\n*   Anonymous arrow functions like `export default () => <div />;` cause Fast Refresh to not preserve local component state. For large codebases you can use our [`name-default-component` codemod](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/upgrading/codemods#name-default-component).\n\nAs more of your codebase moves to function components and Hooks, you can expect state to be preserved in more cases.\n\n## [Tips](#tips)\n\n*   Fast Refresh preserves React local state in function components (and Hooks) by default.\n*   Sometimes you might want to _force_ the state to be reset, and a component to be remounted. For example, this can be handy if you're tweaking an animation that only happens on mount. To do this, you can add `// @refresh reset` anywhere in the file you're editing. This directive is local to the file, and instructs Fast Refresh to remount components defined in that file on every edit.\n*   You can put `console.log` or `debugger;` into the components you edit during development.\n*   Remember that imports are case sensitive. Both fast and full refresh can fail, when your import doesn't match the actual filename. For example, `'./header'` vs `'./Header'`.\n\n## [Fast Refresh and Hooks](#fast-refresh-and-hooks)\n\nWhen possible, Fast Refresh attempts to preserve the state of your component between edits. In particular, `useState` and `useRef` preserve their previous values as long as you don't change their arguments or the order of the Hook calls.\n\nHooks with dependencies—such as `useEffect`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback`—will _always_ update during Fast Refresh. Their list of dependencies will be ignored while Fast Refresh is happening.\n\nFor example, when you edit `useMemo(() => x * 2, [x])` to `useMemo(() => x * 10, [x])`, it will re-run even though `x` (the dependency) has not changed. If React didn't do that, your edit wouldn't reflect on the screen!\n\nSometimes, this can lead to unexpected results. For example, even a `useEffect` with an empty array of dependencies would still re-run once during Fast Refresh.\n\nHowever, writing code resilient to occasional re-running of `useEffect` is a good practice even without Fast Refresh. It will make it easier for you to introduce new dependencies to it later on and it's enforced by [React Strict Mode](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/next-config-js/reactStrictMode), which we highly recommend enabling.",

    "markdown": "# Architecture: Supported Browsers | Next.js\n\nNext.js supports **modern browsers** with zero configuration.\n\n*   Chrome 64+\n*   Edge 79+\n*   Firefox 67+\n*   Opera 51+\n*   Safari 12+\n\n## [Browserslist](#browserslist)\n\nIf you would like to target specific browsers or features, Next.js supports [Browserslist](https://browsersl.ist/) configuration in your `package.json` file. Next.js uses the following Browserslist configuration by default:\n\n```\n{\n  \"browserslist\": [\n    \"chrome 64\",\n    \"edge 79\",\n    \"firefox 67\",\n    \"opera 51\",\n    \"safari 12\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n## [Polyfills](#polyfills)\n\nWe inject [widely used polyfills](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/packages/next-polyfill-nomodule/src/index.js), including:\n\n*   [**fetch()**](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) — Replacing: `whatwg-fetch` and `unfetch`.\n*   [**URL**](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/URL) — Replacing: the [`url` package (Node.js API)](https://nodejs.org/api/url.html).\n*   [**Object.assign()**](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/assign) — Replacing: `object-assign`, `object.assign`, and `core-js/object/assign`.\n\nIf any of your dependencies include these polyfills, they’ll be eliminated automatically from the production build to avoid duplication.\n\nIn addition, to reduce bundle size, Next.js will only load these polyfills for browsers that require them. The majority of the web traffic globally will not download these polyfills.\n\n### [Custom Polyfills](#custom-polyfills)\n\nIf your own code or any external npm dependencies require features not supported by your target browsers (such as IE 11), you need to add polyfills yourself.\n\nIn this case, you should add a top-level import for the **specific polyfill** you need in your [Custom `<App>`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/custom-app) or the individual component.\n\n## [JavaScript Language Features](#javascript-language-features)\n\nNext.js allows you to use the latest JavaScript features out of the box. In addition to [ES6 features](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features), Next.js also supports:\n\n*   [Async/await](https://github.com/tc39/ecmascript-asyncawait) (ES2017)\n*   [Object Rest/Spread Properties](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-object-rest-spread) (ES2018)\n*   [Dynamic `import()`](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-dynamic-import) (ES2020)\n*   [Optional Chaining](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-optional-chaining) (ES2020)\n*   [Nullish Coalescing](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-nullish-coalescing) (ES2020)\n*   [Class Fields](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-class-fields) and [Static Properties](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-static-class-features) (ES2022)\n*   and more!\n\n### [TypeScript Features](#typescript-features)\n\nNext.js has built-in TypeScript support. [Learn more here](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/typescript).\n\n### [Customizing Babel Config (Advanced)](#customizing-babel-config-advanced)\n\nYou can customize babel configuration.

    "markdown": "# App Router | Next.js\n\nThe Next.js App Router introduces a new model for building applications using React's latest features such as [Server Components](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components), [Streaming with Suspense](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/loading-ui-and-streaming#streaming-with-suspense), and [Server Actions](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/server-actions-and-mutations).\n\nGet started with the App Router by [creating your first page](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts).\n\n## [Frequently Asked Questions](#frequently-asked-questions)\n\n### [How can I access the request object in a layout?](#how-can-i-access-the-request-object-in-a-layout)\n\nYou intentionally cannot access the raw request object. However, you can access [`headers`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/headers) and [`cookies`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/cookies) through server-only functions. You can also [set cookies](#how-can-i-set-cookies).\n\n[Layouts](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts#layouts) do not rerender. They can be cached and reused to avoid unnecessary computation when navigating between pages. By restricting layouts from accessing the raw request, Next.js can prevent the execution of potentially slow or expensive user code within the layout, which could negatively impact performance.\n\nThis design also enforces consistent and predictable behavior for layouts across different pages, which simplifies development and debugging.\n\nDepending on the UI pattern you're building, [Parallel Routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/parallel-routes) allow you to render multiple pages in the same layout, and pages have access to the route segments as well as the URL search params.\n\n### [How can I access the URL on a page?](#how-can-i-access-the-url-on-a-page)\n\nBy default, pages are Server Components. You can access the route segments through the [`params`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/page#params-optional) prop and the URL search params through the [`searchParams`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/page#searchparams-optional) prop for a given page.\n\nIf you are using Client Components, you can use [`usePathname`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-pathname), [`useSelectedLayoutSegment`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-selected-layout-segment), and [`useSelectedLayoutSegments`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/use-selected-layout-segments) for more complex routes.\n\nFurther, depending on the UI pattern you're building, [Parallel Routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/parallel-routes) allow you to render multiple pages in the same layout, and pages have access to the route segments as well as the URL search params.\n\n### [How can I redirect from a Server Component?](#how-can-i-redirect-from-a-server-component)\n\nYou can use [`redirect`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/redirect) to redirect from a page to a relative or absolute URL. [`redirect`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/redirect) is a temporary (307) redirect, while [`permanentRedirect`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/permanentRedirect) is a permanent (308) redirect. When these functions are used while streaming UI, they will insert a meta tag to emit the redirect on the client side.\n\n### [How can I handle authentication with the App Router?](#how-can-i-handle-authentication-with-the-app-router)\n\nHere are some common authentication solutions that support the App Router:\n\n*   [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/nextjs#in-app-router)\n*   [Clerk](https://clerk.com/docs/quickstarts/nextjs)\n*   [Lucia](https://lucia-auth.com/getting-started/nextjs-app)\n*   [Auth0](https://github.com/auth0/nextjs-auth0#app-router)\n*   [Stytch](https://stytch.com/docs/example-apps/frontend/nextjs)\n*   [Kinde](https://kinde.com/docs/developer-tools/nextjs-sdk/)\n*   Or manually handling sessions or JWTs\n\n### [How can I set cookies?](#how-can-i-set-cookies)\n\nYou can set cookies in [Server Actions](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/server-actions-and-mutations#cookies) or [Route Handlers](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-handlers) using the [`cookies`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/cookies) function.\n\nSince HTTP does not allow setting cookies after streaming starts, you cannot set cookies from a page or layout directly. You can also set cookies from [Middleware](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware#using-cookies).\n\n### [How can I build multi-tenant apps?](#how-can-i-build-multi-tenant-apps)\n\nIf you are looking to build a single Next.js application that serves multiple tenants, we have [built an example](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/platforms-starter-kit) showing our recommended architecture.\n\n### [How can I invalidate the App Router cache?](#how-can-i-invalidate-the-app-router-cache)\n\nThere are multiple layers of caching in Next.js, and thus, multiple ways to invalidate different parts of the cache. [Learn more about caching](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/caching).\n\n### [Are there any comprehensive, open-source applications built on the App Router?](#are-there-any-comprehensive-open-source-applications-built-on-the-app-router)\n\nYes. You can view [Next.js Commerce](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/nextjs-commerce) or the [Platforms Starter Kit](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/platforms-starter-kit) for two larger examples of using the App Router that are open-source.\n\n## [Learn More](#learn-more)\n\n*   [Routing Fundamentals](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing)\n*   [Data Fetching, Caching, and Revalidating](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/fetching-caching-and-revalidating)\n*   [Forms and Mutations](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/server-actions-and-mutations)\n*   [Caching](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/caching)\n*   [Rendering Fundamentals](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering)\n*   [Server Components](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components)\n*   [Client Components](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/client-components)",

    "url": "https://nextjs.org/docs/architecture/nextjs-compiler",
    "markdown": "# Architecture: Next.js Compiler | Next.js\n\nThe Next.js Compiler, written in Rust using [SWC](https://swc.rs/), allows Next.js to transform and minify your JavaScript code for production. This replaces Babel for individual files and Terser for minifying output bundles.\n\nCompilation using the Next.js Compiler is 17x faster than Babel and enabled by default since Next.js version 12. If you have an existing Babel configuration or are using [unsupported features](#unsupported-features), your application will opt-out of the Next.js Compiler and continue using Babel.\n\n## [Why SWC?](#why-swc)\n\n[SWC](https://swc.rs/) is an extensible Rust-based platform for the next generation of fast developer tools.\n\nSWC can be used for compilation, minification, bundling, and more – and is designed to be extended. It's something you can call to perform code transformations (either built-in or custom). Running those transformations happens through higher-level tools like Next.js.\n\nWe chose to build on SWC for a few reasons:\n\n*   **Extensibility:** SWC can be used as a Crate inside Next.js, without having to fork the library or workaround design constraints.\n*   **Performance:** We were able to achieve ~3x faster Fast Refresh and ~5x faster builds in Next.js by switching to SWC, with more room for optimization still in progress.\n*   **WebAssembly:** Rust's support for WASM is essential for supporting all possible platforms and taking Next.js development everywhere.\n*   **Community:** The Rust community and ecosystem are amazing and still growing.\n\n## [Supported Features](#supported-features)\n\n### [Styled Components](#styled-components)\n\nWe're working to port `babel-plugin-styled-components` to the Next.js Compiler.\n\nFirst, update to the latest version of Next.js: `npm install next@latest`. Then, update your `next.config.js` file:\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  compiler: {\n    styledComponents: true,\n  },\n}\n```\n\nFor advanced use cases, you can configure individual properties for styled-components compilation.\n\n> Note: `minify`, `transpileTemplateLiterals` and `pure` are not yet implemented. You can follow the progress [here](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/30802). `ssr` and `displayName` transforms are the main requirement for using `styled-components` in Next.js.\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  compiler: {\n    // see https://styled-components.com/docs/tooling#babel-plugin for more info on the options.\n    styledComponents: {\n      // Enabled by default in development, disabled in production to reduce file size,\n      // setting this will override the default for all environments.\n      displayName?: boolean,\n      // Enabled by default.\n      ssr?: boolean,\n      // Enabled by default.\n      fileName?: boolean,\n      // Empty by default.\n      topLevelImportPaths?: string[],\n      // Defaults to [\"index\"].\n      meaninglessFileNames?: string[],\n      // Enabled by default.\n      cssProp?: boolean,\n      // Empty by default.\n      namespace?: string,\n      // Not supported yet.\n      minify?: boolean,\n      // Not supported yet.\n      transpileTemplateLiterals?: boolean,\n      // Not supported yet.\n      pure?: boolean,\n    },\n  },\n}\n```\n\n### [Jest](#jest)\n\nThe Next.js Compiler transpiles your tests and simplifies configuring Jest together with Next.js including:\n\n*   Auto mocking of `.css`, `.module.css` (and their `.scss` variants), and image imports\n*   Automatically sets up `transform` using SWC\n*   Loading `.env` (and all variants) into `process.env`\n*   Ignores `node_modules` from test resolving and transforms\n*   Ignoring `.next` from test resolving\n*   Loads `next.config.js` for flags that enable experimental SWC transforms\n\nFirst, update to the latest version of Next.js: `npm install next@latest`. Then, update your `jest.config.js` file:\n\n```\nconst nextJest = require('next/jest')\n \n// Providing the path to your Next.js app which will enable loading next.config.js and .env files\nconst createJestConfig = nextJest({ dir: './' })\n \n// Any custom config you want to pass to Jest\nconst customJestConfig = {\n  setupFilesAfterEnv: ['<rootDir>/jest.setup.js'],\n}\n \n// createJestConfig is exported in this way to ensure that next/jest can load the Next.js configuration, which is async\nmodule.exports = createJestConfig(customJestConfig)\n```\n\n### [Relay](#relay)\n\nTo enable [Relay](https://relay.dev/) support:\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  compiler: {\n    relay: {\n      // This should match relay.config.js\n      src: './',\n      artifactDirectory: './__generated__',\n      language: 'typescript',\n      eagerEsModules: false,\n    },\n  },\n}\n```\n\n> **Good to know**: In Next.js, all JavaScript files in `pages` directory are considered routes. So, for `relay-compiler` you'll need to specify `artifactDirectory` configuration settings outside of the `pages`, otherwise `relay-compiler` will generate files next to the source file in the `__generated__` directory, and this file will be considered a route, which will break production builds.\n\n### [Remove React Properties](#remove-react-properties)\n\nAllows to remove JSX properties. This is often used for testing. Similar to `babel-plugin-react-remove-properties`.\n\nTo remove properties matching the default regex `^data-test`:\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  compiler: {\n    reactRemoveProperties: true,\n  },\n}\n```\n\nTo remove custom properties:\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  compiler: {\n    // The regexes defined here are processed in Rust so the syntax is different from\n    // JavaScript `RegExp`s. See https://docs.rs/regex.\n    reactRemoveProperties: { properties: ['^data-custom$'] },\n  },\n}\n```\n\n### [Remove Console](#remove-console)\n\nThis transform allows for removing all `console.*` calls in application code (not `node_modules`). Similar to `babel-plugin-transform-remove-console`.\n\nRemove all `console.*` calls:\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  compiler: {\n    removeConsole: true,\n  },\n}\n```\n\nRemove `console.*` output except `console.error`:\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  compiler: {\n    removeConsole: {\n      exclude: ['error'],\n    },\n  },\n}\n```\n\n### [Legacy Decorators](#legacy-decorators)\n\nNext.js will automatically detect `experimentalDecorators` in `jsconfig.json` or `tsconfig.json`. Legacy decorators are commonly used with older versions of libraries like `mobx`.\n\nThis flag is only supported for compatibility with existing applications. We do not recommend using legacy decorators in new applications.\n\nFirst, update to the latest version of Next.js: `npm install next@latest`. Then, update your `jsconfig.json` or `tsconfig.json` file:\n\n```\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"experimentalDecorators\": true\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### [importSource](#importsource)\n\nNext.js will automatically detect `jsxImportSource` in `jsconfig.json` or `tsconfig.json` and apply that. This is commonly used with libraries like [Theme UI](https://theme-ui.com/).\n\nFirst, update to the latest version of Next.js: `npm install next@latest`. Then, update your `jsconfig.json` or `tsconfig.json` file:\n\n```\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"jsxImportSource\": \"theme-ui\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### [Emotion](#emotion)\n\nWe're working to port `@emotion/babel-plugin` to the Next.js Compiler.\n\nFirst, update to the latest version of Next.js: `npm install next@latest`. Then, update your `next.config.js` file:\n\n```\n \nmodule.exports = {\n  compiler: {\n    emotion: boolean | {\n      // default is true. It will be disabled when build type is production.\n      sourceMap?: boolean,\n      // default is 'dev-only'.\n      autoLabel?: 'never' | 'dev-only' | 'always',\n      // default is '[local]'.\n      // Allowed values: `[local]` `[filename]` and `[dirname]`\n      // This option only works when autoLabel is set to 'dev-only' or 'always'.\n      // It allows you to define the format of the resulting label.\n      // The format is defined via string where variable parts are enclosed in square brackets [].\n      // For example labelFormat: \"my-classname--[local]\", where [local] will be replaced with the name of the variable the result is assigned to.\n      labelFormat?: string,\n      // default is undefined.\n      // This option allows you to tell the compiler what imports it should\n      // look at to determine what it should transform so if you re-export\n      // Emotion's exports, you can still use transforms.\n      importMap?: {\n        [packageName: string]: {\n          [exportName: string]: {\n            canonicalImport?: [string, string],\n            styledBaseImport?: [string, string],\n          }\n        }\n      },\n    },\n  },\n}\n```\n\n### [Minification](#minification)\n\nNext.js' swc compiler is used for minification by default since v13. This is 7x faster than Terser.\n\nIf Terser is still needed for any reason this can be configured.\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  swcMinify: false,\n}\n```\n\n### [Module Transpilation](#module-transpilation)\n\nNext.js can automatically transpile and bundle dependencies from local packages (like monorepos) or from external dependencies (`node_modules`). This replaces the `next-transpile-modules` package.\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  transpilePackages: ['@acme/ui', 'lodash-es'],\n}\n```\n\n### [Modularize Imports](#modularize-imports)\n\nThis option has been superseded by [`optimizePackageImports`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/optimizePackageImports) in Next.js 13.5. We recommend upgrading to use the new option that does not require manual configuration of import paths.\n\n## [Experimental Features](#experimental-features)\n\n### [SWC Trace profiling](#swc-trace-profiling)\n\nYou can generate SWC's internal transform traces as chromium's [trace event format](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CvAClvFfyA5R-PhYUmn5OOQtYMH4h6I0nSsKchNAySU/preview?mode=html#%21=).\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  experimental: {\n    swcTraceProfiling: true,\n  },\n}\n```\n\nOnce enabled, swc will generate trace named as `swc-trace-profile-${timestamp}.json` under `.next/`. Chromium's trace viewer (chrome://tracing/, [https://ui.perfetto.dev/](https://ui.perfetto.dev/)), or compatible flamegraph viewer ([https://www.speedscope.app/](https://www.speedscope.app/)) can load & visualize generated traces.\n\n### [SWC Plugins (Experimental)](#swc-plugins-experimental)\n\nYou can configure swc's transform to use SWC's experimental plugin support written in wasm to customize transformation behavior.\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  experimental: {\n    swcPlugins: [\n      [\n        'plugin',\n        {\n          ...pluginOptions,\n        },\n      ],\n    ],\n  },\n}\n```\n\n`swcPlugins` accepts an array of tuples for configuring plugins. A tuple for the plugin contains the path to the plugin and an object for plugin configuration. The path to the plugin can be an npm module package name or an absolute path to the `.wasm` binary itself.\n\n## [Unsupported Features](#unsupported-features)\n\nWhen your application has a `.babelrc` file, Next.js will automatically fall back to using Babel for transforming individual files. This ensures backwards compatibility with existing applications that leverage custom Babel plugins.\n\nIf you're using a custom Babel setup, [please share your configuration](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/30174). We're working to port as many commonly used Babel transformations as possible, as well as supporting plugins in the future.\n\n## [Version History](#version-history)\n\n| Version | Changes |\n| --- | --- |\n| `v13.1.0` | [Module Transpilation](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-13-1#built-in-module-transpilation-stable) and [Modularize Imports](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-13-1#import-resolution-for-smaller-bundles) stable. |\n| `v13.0.0` | SWC Minifier enabled by default. |\n| `v12.3.0` | SWC Minifier [stable](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-12-3#swc-minifier-stable). |\n| `v12.2.0` | [SWC Plugins](#swc-plugins-experimental) experimental support added. |\n| `v12.1.0` | Added support for Styled Components, Jest, Relay, Remove React Properties, Legacy Decorators, Remove Console, and jsxImportSource. |\n| `v12.0.0` | Next.js Compiler [introduced](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-12). |",

    "markdown": "# Community: Contribution Guide | Next.js\n\nWelcome to the Next.js Docs Contribution Guide! We're excited to have you here.\n\nThis page provides instructions on how to edit the Next.js documentation. Our goal is to ensure that everyone in the community feels empowered to contribute and improve our docs.\n\n## [Why Contribute?](#why-contribute)\n\nOpen-source work is never done, and neither is documentation. Contributing to docs is a good way for beginners to get involved in open-source and for experienced developers to clarify more complex topics while sharing their knowledge with the community.\n\nBy contributing to the Next.js docs, you're helping us build a more robust learning resource for all developers. Whether you've found a typo, a confusing section, or you've realized that a particular topic is missing, your contributions are welcomed and appreciated.\n\n## [How to Contribute](#how-to-contribute)\n\nThe docs content can be found on the [Next.js repo](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/docs). To contribute, you can edit the files directly on GitHub or clone the repo and edit the files locally.\n\n### [GitHub Workflow](#github-workflow)\n\nIf you're new to GitHub, we recommend reading the [GitHub Open Source Guide](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/#opening-a-pull-request) to learn how to fork a repository, create a branch, and submit a pull request.\n\n> **Good to know**: The underlying docs code lives in a private codebase that is synced to the Next.js public repo. This means that you can't preview the docs locally. However, you'll see your changes on [nextjs.org](https://nextjs.org/docs) after merging a pull request.\n\n### [Writing MDX](#writing-mdx)\n\nThe docs are written in [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/), a markdown format that supports JSX syntax. This allows us to embed React components in the docs. See the [GitHub Markdown Guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) for a quick overview of markdown syntax.\n\n### [VSCode](#vscode)\n\n#### [Previewing Changes Locally](#previewing-changes-locally)\n\nVSCode has a built-in markdown previewer that you can use to see your edits locally. To enable the previewer for MDX files, you'll need to add a configuration option to your user settings.\n\nOpen the command palette (`⌘ + ⇧ + P` on Mac or `Ctrl + Shift + P` on Windows) and search from `Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)`.\n\nThen, add the following line to your `settings.json` file:\n\n```\n{\n  \"files.associations\": {\n    \"*.mdx\": \"markdown\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNext, open the command palette again, and search for `Markdown: Preview File` or `Markdown: Open Preview to the Side`. This will open a preview window where you can see your formatted changes.\n\n#### [Extensions](#extensions)\n\nWe also recommend the following extensions for VSCode users:\n\n*   [MDX](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=unifiedjs.vscode-mdx): Intellisense and syntax highlighting for MDX.\n*   [Grammarly](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=znck.grammarly): Grammar and spell checker.\n*   [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode): Format MDX files on save.\n\n### [Review Process](#review-process)\n\nOnce you've submitted your contribution, the Next.js or Developer Experience teams will review your changes, provide feedback, and merge the pull request when it's ready.\n\nPlease let us know if you have any questions or need further assistance in your PR's comments. Thank you for contributing to the Next.js docs and being a part of our community!\n\n> **Tip:** Run `pnpm prettier-fix` to run Prettier before submitting your PR.\n\n## [File Structure](#file-structure)\n\nThe docs use **file-system routing**. Each folder and files inside [`/docs`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/docs) represent a route segment. These segments are used to generate the URL paths, navigation, and breadcrumbs.\n\nThe file structure reflects the navigation that you see on the site, and by default, navigation items are sorted alphabetically. However, we can change the order of the items by prepending a two-digit number (`00-`) to the folder or file name.\n\nFor example, in the [functions API Reference](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions), the pages are sorted alphabetically because it makes it easier for developers to find a specific function:\n\n```\n03-functions\n├── cookies.mdx\n├── draft-mode.mdx\n├── fetch.mdx\n└── ...\n```\n\nBut, in the [routing section](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing), the files are prefixed with a two-digit number, sorted in the order developers should learn these concepts:\n\n```\n02-routing\n├── 01-defining-routes.mdx\n├── 02-pages-and-layouts.mdx\n├── 03-linking-and-navigating.mdx\n└── ...\n```\n\nTo quickly find a page, you can use `⌘ + P` (Mac) or `Ctrl + P` (Windows) to open the search bar on VSCode. Then, type the slug of the page you're looking for. E.g. `defining-routes`\n\n> **Why not use a manifest?**\n> \n> We considered using a manifest file (another popular way to generate the docs navigation), but we found that a manifest would quickly get out of sync with the files. File-system routing forces us to think about the structure of the docs and feels more native to Next.js.\n\nEach page has a metadata block at the top of the file separated by three dashes.\n\n### [Required Fields](#required-fields)\n\nThe following fields are **required**:\n\n| Field | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `title` | The page's `<h1>` title, used for SEO and OG Images. |\n| `description` | The page's description, used in the `<meta name=\"description\">` tag for SEO. |\n\n```\n---\ntitle: Page Title\ndescription: Page Description\n---\n```\n\nIt's good practice to limit the page title to 2-3 words (e.g. Optimizing Images) and the description to 1-2 sentences (e.g. Learn how to optimize images in Next.js).\n\n### [Optional Fields](#optional-fields)\n\nThe following fields are **optional**:\n\n| Field | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `nav_title` | Overrides the page's title in the navigation. This is useful when the page's title is too long to fit. If not provided, the `title` field is used. |\n| `source` | Pulls content into a shared page. See [Shared Pages](#shared-pages). |\n| `related` | A list of related pages at the bottom of the document. These will automatically be turned into cards. See [Related Links](#related-links). |\n\n```\n---\nnav_title: Nav Item Title\nsource: app/building-your-application/optimizing/images\nrelated:\n  description: See the image component API reference.\n  links:\n    - app/api-reference/components/image\n---\n```\n\n## [`App` and `Pages` Docs](#app-and-pages-docs)\n\nSince most of the features in the **App Router** and **Pages Router** are completely different, their docs for each are kept in separate sections (`02-app` and `03-pages`). However, there are a few features that are shared between them.\n\n### [Shared Pages](#shared-pages)\n\nTo avoid content duplication and risk the content becoming out of sync, we use the `source` field to pull content from one page into another. For example, the `<Link>` component behaves _mostly_ the same in **App** and **Pages**. Instead of duplicating the content, we can pull the content from `app/.../link.mdx` into `pages/.../link.mdx`:\n\n```\n---\ntitle: <Link>\ndescription: API reference for the <Link> component.\n---\n \nThis API reference will help you understand how to use the props\nand configuration options available for the Link Component.\n```\n\n```\n---\ntitle: <Link>\ndescription: API reference for the <Link> component.\nsource: app/api-reference/components/link\n---\n \n{/* DO NOT EDIT THIS PAGE. */}\n{/* The content of this page is pulled from the source above. */}\n```\n\nWe can therefore edit the content in one place and have it reflected in both sections.\n\n### [Shared Content](#shared-content)\n\nIn shared pages, sometimes there might be content that is **App Router** or **Pages Router** specific. For example, the `<Link>` component has a `shallow` prop that is only available in **Pages** but not in **App**.\n\nTo make sure the content only shows in the correct router, we can wrap content blocks in an `<AppOnly>` or `<PagesOnly>` components:\n\n```\nThis content is shared between App and Pages.\n \n<PagesOnly>\n \nThis content will only be shown on the Pages docs.\n \n</PagesOnly>\n \nThis content is shared between App and Pages.\n```\n\nYou'll likely use these components for examples and code blocks.\n\n## [Code Blocks](#code-blocks)\n\nCode blocks should contain a minimum working example that can be copied and pasted. This means that the code should be able to run without any additional configuration.\n\nFor example, if you're showing how to use the `<Link>` component, you should include the `import` statement and the `<Link>` component itself.\n\n```\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return <Link href=\"/about\">About</Link>\n}\n```\n\nAlways run examples locally before committing them. This will ensure that the code is up-to-date and working.\n\n### [Language and Filename](#language-and-filename)\n\nCode blocks should have a header that includes the language and the `filename`. Add a `filename` prop to render a special Terminal icon that helps orientate users where to input the command. For example:\n\n````\n```bash filename=\"Terminal\"\nnpx create-next-app\n```\n````\n\nMost examples in the docs are written in `tsx` and `jsx`, and a few in `bash`. However, you can use any supported language, here's the [full list](https://github.com/shikijs/shiki/blob/main/docs/languages.md#all-languages).\n\nWhen writing JavaScript code blocks, we use the following language and extension combinations.\n\n|     | Language | Extension |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| JavaScript files with JSX code | \\`\\`\\`jsx | .js |\n| JavaScript files without JSX | \\`\\`\\`js | .js |\n| TypeScript files with JSX | \\`\\`\\`tsx | .tsx |\n| TypeScript files without JSX | \\`\\`\\`ts | .ts |\n\n### [TS and JS Switcher](#ts-and-js-switcher)\n\nAdd a language switcher to toggle between TypeScript and JavaScript. Code blocks should be TypeScript first with a JavaScript version to accommodate users.\n\nCurrently, we write TS and JS examples one after the other, and link them with `switcher` prop:\n\n````\n```tsx filename=\"app/page.tsx\" switcher\n \n```\n \n```jsx filename=\"app/page.js\" switcher\n \n```\n````\n\n> **Good to know**: We plan to automatically compile TypeScript snippets to JavaScript in the future. In the meantime, you can use [transform.tools](https://transform.tools/typescript-to-javascript).\n\n### [Line Highlighting](#line-highlighting)\n\nCode lines can be highlighted. This is useful when you want to draw attention to a specific part of the code. You can highlight lines by passing a number to the `highlight` prop.\n\n**Single Line:** `highlight={1}`\n\n```\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return <Link href=\"/about\">About</Link>\n}\n```\n\n**Multiple Lines:** `highlight={1,3}`\n\n```\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return <Link href=\"/about\">About</Link>\n}\n```\n\n**Range of Lines:** `highlight={1-5}`\n\n```\nimport Link from 'next/link'\n \nexport default function Page() {\n  return <Link href=\"/about\">About</Link>\n}\n```\n\n## [Icons](#icons)\n\nThe following icons are available for use in the docs:\n\n```\n<Check size={18} />\n<Cross size={18} />\n```\n\n**Output:**\n\nWe do not use emojis in the docs.\n\n## [Notes](#notes)\n\nFor information that is important but not critical, use notes. Notes are a good way to add information without distracting the user from the main content.\n\n```\n> **Good to know**: This is a single line note.\n \n> **Good to know**:\n>\n> - We also use this format for multi-line notes.\n> - There are sometimes multiple items worth knowing or keeping in mind.\n```\n\n**Output:**\n\n> **Good to know**: This is a single line note.\n\n> **Good to know**:\n> \n> *   We also use this format for multi-line notes.\n> *   There are sometimes multiple item worths knowing or keeping in mind.\n\nRelated Links guide the user's learning journey by adding links to logical next steps.\n\n*   Links will be displayed in cards under the main content of the page.\n*   Links will be automatically generated for pages that have child pages. For example, the [Optimizing](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing) section has links to all of its child pages.\n\nCreate related links using the `related` field in the page's metadata.\n\n```\n---\nrelated:\n  description: Learn how to quickly get started with your first application.\n  links:\n    - app/building-your-application/routing/defining-routes\n    - app/building-your-application/data-fetching\n    - app/api-reference/file-conventions/page\n---\n```\n\n### [Nested Fields](#nested-fields)\n\n| Field | Required? | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `title` | Optional | The title of the card list. Defaults to **Next Steps**. |\n| `description` | Optional | The description of the card list. |\n| `links` | Required | A list of links to other doc pages. Each list item should be a relative URL path (without a leading slash) e.g. `app/api-reference/file-conventions/page` |\n\n## [Diagrams](#diagrams)\n\nDiagrams are a great way to explain complex concepts. We use [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) to create diagrams, following Vercel's design guide.\n\nThe diagrams currently live in the `/public` folder in our private Next.js site. If you'd like to update or add a diagram, please open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/new?assignees=&labels=template%3A+documentation&projects=&template=4.docs_request.yml&title=Docs%3A+) with your ideas.\n\n## [Custom Components and HTML](#custom-components-and-html)\n\nThese are the React Components available for the docs: `<Image />` (next/image), `<PagesOnly />`, `<AppOnly />`, `<Cross />`, and `<Check />`. We do not allow raw HTML in the docs besides the `<details>` tag.\n\nIf you have ideas for new components, please open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/new/choose).\n\n## [Style Guide](#style-guide)\n\nThis section contains guidelines for writing docs for those who are new to technical writing.\n\n### [Page Templates](#page-templates)\n\nWhile we don't have a strict template for pages, there are page sections you'll see repeated across the docs:\n\n*   **Overview:** The first paragraph of a page should tell the user what the feature is and what it's used for. Followed by a minimum working example or its API reference.\n*   **Convention:** If the feature has a convention, it should be explained here.\n*   **Examples**: Show how the feature can be used with different use cases.\n*   **API Tables**: API Pages should have an overview table at the of the page with jump-to-section links (when possible).\n*   **Next Steps (Related Links)**: Add links to related pages to guide the user's learning journey.\n\nFeel free to add these sections as needed.\n\n### [Page Types](#page-types)\n\nDocs pages are also split into two categories: Conceptual and Reference.\n\n*   **Conceptual** pages are used to explain a concept or feature. They are usually longer and contain more information than reference pages. In the Next.js docs, conceptual pages are found in the **Building Your Application** section.\n*   **Reference** pages are used to explain a specific API. They are usually shorter and more focused. In the Next.js docs, reference pages are found in the **API Reference** section.\n\n> **Good to know**: Depending on the page you're contributing to, you may need to follow a different voice and style. For example, conceptual pages are more instructional and use the word _you_ to address the user. Reference pages are more technical, they use more imperative words like \"create, update, accept\" and tend to omit the word _you_.\n\n### [Voice](#voice)\n\nHere are some guidelines to maintain a consistent style and voice across the docs:\n\n*   Write clear, concise sentences. Avoid tangents.\n    *   If you find yourself using a lot of commas, consider breaking the sentence into multiple sentences or use a list.\n    *   Swap out complex words for simpler ones. For example, _use_ instead of _utilize_.\n*   Be mindful with the word _this_. It can be ambiguous and confusing, don't be afraid to repeat the subject of the sentence if unclear.\n    *   For example, _Next.js uses React_ instead of _Next.js uses this_.\n*   Use an active voice instead of passive. An active sentence is easier to read.\n    *   For example, _Next.js uses React_ instead of _React is used by Next.js_. If you find yourself using words like _was_ and _by_ you may be using a passive voice.\n*   Avoid using words like _easy_, _quick_, _simple_, _just_, etc. This is subjective and can be discouraging to users.\n*   Avoid negative words like _don't_, _can't_, _won't_, etc. This can be discouraging to readers.\n    *   For example, _\"You can use the `Link` component to create links between pages\"_ instead of _\"Don't use the `<a>` tag to create links between pages\"_.\n*   Write in second person (you/your). This is more personal and engaging.\n*   Use gender-neutral language. Use _developers_, _users_, or _readers_, when referring to the audience.\n*   If adding code examples, ensure they are properly formatted and working.\n\nWhile these guidelines are not exhaustive, they should help you get started.

The guide is for Next.js developers who:\n\n*   Currently use the beta Next.js Middleware features\n*   Choose to upgrade to the next stable version of Next.js (`v12.2`)\n\nYou can start upgrading your Middleware usage today with the latest release (`npm i next@latest`).\n\n> **Note**: These changes described in this guide are included in Next.js `12.2`. You can keep your current site structure, including nested Middleware, until you move to `12.2` (or a `canary` build of Next.js).\n\nIf you have ESLint configured, you will need to run `npm i eslint-config-next@latest --save-dev` to upgrade your ESLint configuration to ensure the same version is being used as the Next.js version. You might also need to restart VSCode for the changes to take effect.\n\n## [Using Next.js Middleware on Vercel](#using-nextjs-middleware-on-vercel)\n\nIf you're using Next.js on Vercel, your existing deploys using Middleware will continue to work, and you can continue to deploy your site using Middleware.

[Executing Middleware on Internal Next.js Requests](#executing-middleware-on-internal-nextjs-requests)\n\n## [No Nested Middleware](#no-nested-middleware)\n\n### [Summary of changes](#summary-of-changes)\n\n*   Define a single Middleware file next to your `pages` folder\n*   No need to prefix the file with an underscore\n*   A custom matcher can be used to define matching routes using an exported config object\n\n### [Explanation](#explanation)\n\nPreviously, you could create a `_middleware.ts` file under the `pages` directory at any level. Middleware execution was based on the file path where it was created.\n\nBased on customer feedback, we have replaced this API with a single root Middleware, which provides the following improvements:\n\n*   **Faster execution with lower latency**: With nested Middleware, a single request could invoke multiple Middleware functions. A single Middleware means a single function execution, which is more efficient.\n*   **Less expensive**: Middleware usage is billed per invocation. Using nested Middleware, a single request could invoke multiple Middleware functions, meaning multiple Middleware charges per request. A single Middleware means a single invocation per request and is more cost effective.\n*   **Middleware can conveniently filter on things besides routes**: With nested Middleware, the Middleware files were located in the `pages` directory and Middleware was executed based on request paths. By moving to a single root Middleware, you can still execute code based on request paths, but you can now more conveniently execute Middleware based on other conditions, like `cookies` or the presence of a request header.\n*   **Deterministic execution ordering**: With nested Middleware, a single request could match multiple Middleware functions. For example, a request to `/dashboard/users/*` would invoke Middleware defined in both `/dashboard/users/_middleware.ts` and `/dashboard/_middleware.js`. However, the execution order is difficult to reason about. Moving to a single, root Middleware more explicitly defines execution order.\n*   **Supports Next.js Layouts (RFC)**: Moving to a single, root Middleware helps support the new [Layouts (RFC) in Next.js](https://nextjs.org/blog/layouts-rfc).\n\n### [How to upgrade](#how-to-upgrade)\n\nYou should declare **one single Middleware file** in your application, which should be located next to the `pages` directory and named **without** an `_` prefix. Your Middleware file can still have either a `.ts` or `.js` extension.\n\nMiddleware will be invoked for **every route in the app**, and a custom matcher can be used to define matching filters. The following is an example for a Middleware that triggers for `/about/*` and `/dashboard/:path*`, the custom matcher is defined in an exported config object:\n\n```\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\nimport type { NextRequest } from 'next/server'\n \nexport function middleware(request: NextRequest) {\n  return NextResponse.rewrite(new URL('/about-2', request.url))\n}\n \n// Supports both a single string value or an array of matchers\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: ['/about/:path*', '/dashboard/:path*'],\n}\n```\n\nThe matcher config also allows full regex so matching like negative lookaheads or character matching is supported. An example of a negative lookahead to match all except specific paths can be seen here:\n\n```\nexport const config = {\n  matcher: [\n    /*\n     * Match all request paths except for the ones starting with:\n     * - api (API routes)\n     * - _next/static (static files)\n     * - favicon.ico (favicon file)\n     */\n    '/((?!api|_next/static|favicon.ico).*)',\n  ],\n}\n```\n\nWhile the config option is preferred since it doesn't get invoked on every request, you can also use conditional statements to only run the Middleware when it matches specific paths. One advantage of using conditionals is defining explicit ordering for when Middleware executes. The following example shows how you can merge two previously nested Middleware:\n\n```\nimport type { NextRequest } from 'next/server'\n \nexport function middleware(request: NextRequest) {\n  if (request.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith('/about')) {\n    // This logic is only applied to /about\n  }\n \n  if (request.nextUrl.pathname.startsWith('/dashboard')) {\n    // This logic is only applied to /dashboard\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## [No Response Body](#no-response-body)\n\n### [Summary of changes](#summary-of-changes-1)\n\n*   Middleware can no longer produce a response body\n*   If your Middleware _does_ respond with a body, a runtime error will be thrown\n*   Migrate to using `rewrite`/`redirect` to pages/APIs handling a response\n\n### [Explanation](#explanation-1)\n\nTo respect the differences in client-side and server-side navigation, and to help ensure that developers do not build insecure Middleware, we are removing the ability to send response bodies in Middleware. This ensures that Middleware is only used to `rewrite`, `redirect`, or modify the incoming request (e.g. [setting cookies](#cookies-api-revamped)).\n\nThe following patterns will no longer work:\n\n```\nnew Response('a text value')\nnew Response(streamOrBuffer)\nnew Response(JSON.stringify(obj), { headers: 'application/json' })\nNextResponse.json()\n```\n\n### [How to upgrade](#how-to-upgrade-1)\n\nFor cases where Middleware is used to respond (such as authorization), you should migrate to use `rewrite`/`redirect` to pages that show an authorization error, login forms, or to an API Route.\n\n#### [Before](#before)\n\n```\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\nimport type { NextRequest } from 'next/server'\nimport { isAuthValid } from './lib/auth'\n \nexport function middleware(request: NextRequest) {\n  // Example function to validate auth\n  if (isAuthValid(request)) {\n    return NextResponse.next()\n  }\n \n  return NextResponse.json({ message: 'Auth required' }, { status: 401 })\n}\n```\n\n#### [After](#after)\n\n```\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\nimport type { NextRequest } from 'next/server'\nimport { isAuthValid } from './lib/auth'\n \nexport function middleware(request: NextRequest) {\n  // Example function to validate auth\n  if (isAuthValid(request)) {\n    return NextResponse.next()\n  }\n \n  const loginUrl = new URL('/login', request.url)\n  loginUrl.searchParams.set('from', request.nextUrl.pathname)\n \n  return NextResponse.redirect(loginUrl)\n}\n```\n\n#### [Edge API Routes](#edge-api-routes)\n\nIf you were previously using Middleware to forward headers to an external API, you can now use [Edge API Routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes):\n\n```\nimport { type NextRequest } from 'next/server'\n \nexport const config = {\n  runtime: 'edge',\n}\n \nexport default async function handler(req: NextRequest) {\n  const authorization = req.cookies.get('authorization')\n  return fetch('https://backend-api.com/api/protected', {\n    method: req.method,\n    headers: {\n      authorization,\n    },\n    redirect: 'manual',\n  })\n}\n```\n\n## [Cookies API Revamped](#cookies-api-revamped)\n\n### [Summary of changes](#summary-of-changes-2)\n\n| Added | Removed |\n| --- | --- |\n| `cookies.set` | `cookie` |\n| `cookies.delete` | `clearCookie` |\n| `cookies.getWithOptions` | `cookies` |\n\n### [Explanation](#explanation-2)\n\nBased on beta feedback, we are changing the Cookies API in `NextRequest` and `NextResponse` to align more to a `get`/`set` model. The `Cookies` API extends Map, including methods like [entries](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map/entries) and [values](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map/entries).\n\n### [How to upgrade](#how-to-upgrade-2)\n\n`NextResponse` now has a `cookies` instance with:\n\n*   `cookies.delete`\n*   `cookies.set`\n*   `cookies.getWithOptions`\n\nAs well as other extended methods from `Map`.\n\n#### [Before](#before-1)\n\n```\n// pages/_middleware.ts\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\nimport type { NextRequest } from 'next/server'\n \nexport function middleware(request: NextRequest) {\n  // create an instance of the class to access the public methods. This uses `next()`,\n  // you could use `redirect()` or `rewrite()` as well\n  let response = NextResponse.next()\n  // get the cookies from the request\n  let cookieFromRequest = request.cookies['my-cookie']\n  // set the `cookie`\n  response.cookie('hello', 'world')\n  // set the `cookie` with options\n  const cookieWithOptions = response.cookie('hello', 'world', {\n    path: '/',\n    maxAge: 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 7,\n    httpOnly: true,\n    sameSite: 'strict',\n    domain: 'example.com',\n  })\n  // clear the `cookie`\n  response.clearCookie('hello')\n \n  return response\n}\n```\n\n#### [After](#after-1)\n\n```\nexport function middleware() {\n  const response = new NextResponse()\n \n  // set a cookie\n  response.cookies.set('vercel', 'fast')\n \n  // set another cookie with options\n  response.cookies.set('nextjs', 'awesome', { path: '/test' })\n \n  // get all the details of a cookie\n  const { value, ...options } = response.cookies.getWithOptions('vercel')\n  console.log(value) // => 'fast'\n  console.log(options) // => { name: 'vercel', Path: '/test' }\n \n  // deleting a cookie will mark it as expired\n  response.cookies.delete('vercel')\n \n  return response\n}\n```\n\n## [New User-Agent Helper](#new-user-agent-helper)\n\n### [Summary of changes](#summary-of-changes-3)\n\n*   Accessing the user agent is no longer available on the request object\n*   We've added a new `userAgent` helper to reduce Middleware size by `17kb`\n\n### [Explanation](#explanation-3)\n\nTo help reduce the size of your Middleware, we have extracted the user agent from the request object and created a new helper `userAgent`.\n\nThe helper is imported from `next/server` and allows you to opt in to using the user agent. The helper gives you access to the same properties that were available from the request object.\n\n### [How to upgrade](#how-to-upgrade-3)\n\n*   Import the `userAgent` helper from `next/server`\n*   Destructure the properties you need to work with\n\n#### [Before](#before-2)\n\n```\nimport { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server'\n \nexport function middleware(request: NextRequest) {\n  const url = request.nextUrl\n  const viewport = request.ua.device.type === 'mobile' ? 'mobile' : 'desktop'\n  url.searchParams.set('viewport', viewport)\n  return NextResponse.rewrite(url)\n}\n```\n\n#### [After](#after-2)\n\n```\nimport { NextRequest, NextResponse, userAgent } from 'next/server'\n \nexport function middleware(request: NextRequest) {\n  const url = request.nextUrl\n  const { device } = userAgent(request)\n  const viewport = device.type === 'mobile' ? 'mobile' : 'desktop'\n  url.searchParams.set('viewport', viewport)\n  return NextResponse.rewrite(url)\n}\n```\n\n## [No More Page Match Data](#no-more-page-match-data)\n\n### [Summary of changes](#summary-of-changes-4)\n\n*   Use [`URLPattern`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/URLPattern) to check if a Middleware is being invoked for a certain page match\n\n### [Explanation](#explanation-4)\n\nCurrently, Middleware estimates whether you are serving an asset of a Page based on the Next.js routes manifest (internal configuration). This value is surfaced through `request.page`.\n\nTo make page and asset matching more accurate, we are now using the web standard `URLPattern` API.\n\n### [How to upgrade](#how-to-upgrade-4)\n\nUse [`URLPattern`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/URLPattern) to check if a Middleware is being invoked for a certain page match.\n\n#### [Before](#before-3)\n\n```\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\nimport type { NextRequest, NextFetchEvent } from 'next/server'\n \nexport function middleware(request: NextRequest, event: NextFetchEvent) {\n  const { params } = event.request.page\n  const { locale, slug } = params\n \n  if (locale && slug) {\n    const { search, protocol, host } = request.nextUrl\n    const url = new URL(`${protocol}//${locale}.${host}/${slug}${search}`)\n    return NextResponse.redirect(url)\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### [After](#after-3)\n\n```\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server'\nimport type { NextRequest } from 'next/server'\n \nconst PATTERNS = [\n  [\n    new URLPattern({ pathname: '/:locale/:slug' }),\n    ({ pathname }) => pathname.groups,\n  ],\n]\n \nconst params = (url) => {\n  const input = url.split('?')[0]\n  let result = {}\n \n  for (const [pattern, handler] of PATTERNS) {\n    const patternResult = pattern.exec(input)\n    if (patternResult !== null && 'pathname' in patternResult) {\n      result = handler(patternResult)\n      break\n    }\n  }\n  return result\n}\n \nexport function middleware(request: NextRequest) {\n  const { locale, slug } = params(request.url)\n \n  if (locale && slug) {\n    const { search, protocol, host } = request.nextUrl\n    const url = new URL(`${protocol}//${locale}.${host}/${slug}${search}`)\n    return NextResponse.redirect(url)\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## [Executing Middleware on Internal Next.js Requests](#executing-middleware-on-internal-nextjs-requests)\n\n### [Summary of changes](#summary-of-changes-5)\n\n*   Middleware will be executed for _all_ requests, including `_next`\n\n### [Explanation](#explanation-5)\n\nPrior to Next.js `v12.2`, Middleware was not executed for `_next` requests.\n\nFor cases where Middleware is used for authorization, you should migrate to use `rewrite`/`redirect` to Pages that show an authorization error, login forms, or to an API Route.\n\nSee [No Response Body](#no-response-body) for an example of how to migrate to use `rewrite`/`redirect`.",

We've spent a lot of effort into ensuring the transition from webpack 4 to 5 will be as smooth as possible.\n\nYour application currently has webpack 5 disabled using the `webpack5: false` flag which has been removed in Next.js 12:\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  // Webpack 5 is enabled by default\n  // You can still use webpack 4 while upgrading to the latest version of Next.js by adding the \"webpack5: false\" flag\n  webpack5: false,\n}\n```\n\nUsing webpack 5 in your application has many benefits, notably:\n\n*   Improved Disk Caching: `next build` is significantly faster on subsequent builds\n*   Improved Fast Refresh: Fast Refresh work is prioritized\n*   Improved Long Term Caching of Assets: Deterministic code output that is less likely to change between builds\n*   Improved Tree Shaking\n*   Support for assets using `new URL(\"file.png\", import.meta.url)`\n*   Support for web workers using `new Worker(new URL(\"worker.js\", import.meta.url))`\n*   Support for `exports`/`imports` field in `package.json`\n\nIn the past releases we have gradually rolled out webpack 5 to Next.js applications:\n\n*   In Next.js 10.2 we automatically opted-in applications without custom webpack configuration in `next.config.js`\n*   In Next.js 10.2 we automatically opted-in applications that do not have a `next.config.js`\n*   In Next.js 11 webpack 5 was enabled by default for all applications. You could still opt-out and use webpack 4 to help with backwards compatibility using `webpack5: false` in `next.config.js`\n*   In Next.js 12 webpack 4 support was removed.\n\n#### [Custom webpack configuration](#custom-webpack-configuration)\n\nIn case you do have custom webpack configuration, either through custom plugins or your own modifications you'll have to take a few steps to ensure your applications works with webpack 5.\n\n*   When using `next-transpile-modules` make sure you use the latest version which includes [this patch](https://github.com/martpie/next-transpile-modules/pull/179)\n*   When using `@zeit/next-css` / `@zeit/next-sass` make sure you use the [built-in CSS/Sass support](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/styling) instead\n*   When using `@zeit/next-preact` use [this example](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/using-preact) instead\n*   When using `@zeit/next-source-maps` use the [built-in production Source Map support](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/next-config-js/productionBrowserSourceMaps)\n*   When using webpack plugins make sure they're upgraded to the latest version, in most cases the latest version will include webpack 5 support.
