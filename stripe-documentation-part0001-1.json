  "markdown": "# Handling errors | Stripe API Reference\n\nOur Client libraries raise exceptions for many reasons, such as a failed charge, invalid parameters, authentication errors, and network unavailability. We recommend writing code that gracefully handles all possible API exceptions.\n\n*   Related guide: [Error Handling](https://docs.stripe.com/error-handling)\n\n```\n# Select a client library to see examples of# handling different kinds of errors.\n```\n\n## [Expanding Responses](https://docs.stripe.com/api/expanding_objects)\n\nMany objects allow you to request additional information as an expanded response by using the `expand` request parameter. This parameter is available on all API requests, and applies to the response of that request only. You can expand responses in two ways.\n\nIn many cases, an object contains the ID of a related object in its response properties. For example, a `Charge` might have an associated Customer ID. You can expand these objects in line with the expand request parameter. The `expandable` label in this documentation indicates ID fields that you can expand into objects.\n\nSome available fields aren’t included in the responses by default, such as the `number` and `cvc` fields for the Issuing Card object. You can request these fields as an expanded response by using the `expand` request parameter.\n\nYou can expand recursively by specifying nested fields after a dot (`.`). For example, requesting `invoice.subscription` on a charge expands the `invoice` property into a full Invoice object, then expands the `subscription` property on that invoice into a full Subscription object.\n\nYou can use the `expand` parameter on any endpoint that returns expandable fields, including list, create, and update endpoints.\n\nExpansions on list requests start with the `data` property. For example, you can expand `data.customers` on a request to list charges and associated customers. Performing deep expansions on numerous list requests might result in slower processing times.\n\nExpansions have a maximum depth of four levels (for example, the deepest expansion allowed when listing charges is `data.invoice.subscription.default_source`).\n\nYou can expand multiple objects at the same time by identifying multiple items in the `expand` array.\n\n*   Related guide: [Expanding responses](https://docs.stripe.com/expand)\n*   Related video: [Expand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8Vj_CEWyQc)\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/charges/ch_3LmzzQ2eZvKYlo2C0XjzUzJV \\  -u sk_test_4eC39Hq...arjtT1zdp7dcsk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc: \\  -d \"expand[]\"=customer \\  -d \"expand[]\"=\"invoice.subscription\" \\  -G\n```\n\n```\n{  \"id\": \"ch_3LmzzQ2eZvKYlo2C0XjzUzJV\",  \"object\": \"charge\",  \"customer\": {    \"id\": \"cu_14HOpH2eZvKYlo2CxXIM7Pb2\",    \"object\": \"customer\",    // ...  },  \"invoice\": {    \"id\": \"in_1LmzzQ2eZvKYlo2CpyWn8szu\",    \"object\": \"invoice\",    \"subscription\": {      \"id\": \"su_1LmzoG2eZvKYlo2Cpw6S7dAq\",      \"object\": \"subscription\",      // ...    },    // ...  },  // ...}\n```\n\n## [Idempotent requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/idempotent_requests)\n\nThe API supports [idempotency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence) for safely retrying requests without accidentally performing the same operation twice. When creating or updating an object, use an idempotency key. Then, if a connection error occurs, you can safely repeat the request without risk of creating a second object or performing the update twice.\n\nTo perform an idempotent request, provide an additional `IdempotencyKey` element to the request options.\n\nStripe’s idempotency works by saving the resulting status code and body of the first request made for any given idempotency key, regardless of whether it succeeds or fails. Subsequent requests with the same key return the same result, including `500` errors.\n\nA client generates an idempotency key, which is a unique key that the server uses to recognize subsequent retries of the same request. How you create unique keys is up to you, but we suggest using V4 UUIDs, or another random string with enough entropy to avoid collisions. Idempotency keys are up to 255 characters long.\n\nYou can remove keys from the system automatically after they’re at least 24 hours old. We generate a new request if a key is reused after the original is pruned. The idempotency layer compares incoming parameters to those of the original request and errors if they’re the same to prevent accidental misuse.\n\nWe save results only after the execution of an endpoint begins. If incoming parameters fail validation, or the request conflicts with another request that’s executing concurrently, we don’t save the idempotent result because no API endpoint initiates the execution. You can retry these requests. Learn more about when you can [retry idempotent requests](https://docs.stripe.com/error-low-level#idempotency).\n\nAll `POST` requests accept idempotency keys. Don’t send idempotency keys in `GET` and `DELETE` requests because it has no effect. These requests are idempotent by definition.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/customers \\  -u sk_test_4eC39Hq...arjtT1zdp7dcsk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc: \\  -H \"Idempotency-Key: KG5LxwFBepaKHyUD\" \\  -d description=\"My First Test Customer (created for API docs at https://docs.stripe.com/api)\"\n```\n\n## [Metadata](https://docs.stripe.com/api/metadata)\n\nUpdateable Stripe objects—including [Account](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts), [Charge](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges), [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers), [PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents), [Refund](https://docs.stripe.com/api/refunds), [Subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions), and [Transfer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/transfers) have a `metadata` parameter. You can use this parameter to attach key-value data to these Stripe objects.\n\nYou can specify up to 50 keys, with key names up to 40 characters long and values up to 500 characters long.\n\nYou can use metadata to store additional, structured information on an object. For example, you could store your user’s full name and corresponding unique identifier from your system on a Stripe [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers) object. Stripe doesn’t use metadata—for example, we don’t use it to authorize or decline a charge and it won’t be seen by your users unless you choose to show it to them.\n\nSome of the objects listed above also support a `description` parameter. You can use the `description` parameter to annotate a charge-for example, a human-readable description such as `2 shirts for test@example.com`. Unlike `metadata`, `description` is a single string, which your users might see (for example, in email receipts Stripe sends on your behalf).\n\nDon’t store any sensitive information (bank account numbers, card details, and so on) as metadata or in the `description` parameter.\n\n*   Related guide: [Metadata](https://docs.stripe.com/metadata)\n\n## Sample metadata use cases\n\n*   **Link IDs**: Attach your system’s unique IDs to a Stripe object to simplify lookups. For example, add your order number to a charge, your user ID to a customer or recipient, or a unique receipt number to a transfer.\n*   **Refund papertrails**: Store information about the reason for a refund and the individual responsible for its creation.\n*   **Customer details**: Annotate a customer by storing an internal ID for your future use.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/customers \\  -u \"sk_test_4eC39Hq...arjtT1zdp7dcsk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc:\" \\  -d \"metadata[order_id]\"=6735\n```\n\n```\n{  \"id\": \"cus_123456789\",  \"object\": \"customer\",  \"address\": {    \"city\": \"city\",    \"country\": \"US\",    \"line1\": \"line 1\",    \"line2\": \"line 2\",    \"postal_code\": \"90210\",    \"state\": \"CA\"  },  \"balance\": 0,  \"created\": 1483565364,  \"currency\": null,  \"default_source\": null,  \"delinquent\": false,  \"description\": null,  \"discount\": null,  \"email\": null,  \"invoice_prefix\": \"C11F7E1\",  \"invoice_settings\": {    \"custom_fields\": null,    \"default_payment_method\": null,    \"footer\": null,    \"rendering_options\": null  },  \"livemode\": false,  \"metadata\": {    \"order_id\": \"6735\"  },  \"name\": null,  \"next_invoice_sequence\": 1,  \"phone\": null,  \"preferred_locales\": [],  \"shipping\": null,  \"tax_exempt\": \"none\"}\n```",

  "markdown": "# Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Declines\n\n## Learn about payment declines and how to lower your decline rate.\n\nPayments can fail for a variety of reasons, including some that help prevent fraudulent transactions. Stripe works to reduce decline rates across all supported payment methods. We work with issuers and networks to improve acceptance rates, often without affecting your integration.\n\nThere are three reasons why a payment might fail:\n\n*   [Issuer declines](https://docs.stripe.com/declines#issuer-declines)\n*   [Blocked payments](https://docs.stripe.com/declines#blocked-payments)\n*   [Invalid API calls](https://docs.stripe.com/declines#invalid-api-calls)\n\nYou need to handle each type of payment failure differently. For every failure, you can use the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/payments) or API to review a payment’s details. When using the API, look at the `Charge` object’s [outcome](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/object#charge_object-outcome). This attribute covers the payment failure type and provides information about its cause.\n\nStripe handles non-card payment method declines similarly to card declines. Stripe sends you a response code that includes information about the decline, for example, if it’s due to insufficient funds, a lost or stolen card, or another reason.\n\n## Issuer declines ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nWhen your customer’s card issuer receives a charge, their automated systems and models decide whether to authorize it. These tools analyze signals such as spending habits, account balance, and card data (expiration date, address information, and CVC).\n\nIf the card issuer declines a payment, Stripe shares with you all of the decline information we receive. This information is available in the Dashboard and through the API. When issuers provide specific explanations, such as an incorrect card number or low funds, these explanations return to Stripe through [decline codes](https://docs.stripe.com/declines/codes).\n\n## Blocked payments ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\n[Stripe Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar \"Radar\") blocks high risk payments, such as those with mismatched CVC or postal code values. This automated fraud prevention product evaluates each payment, without requiring any action from you.\n\n![A payment that Radar declined](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/payment-high-risk-allow-list.1dd70f2d0e26384f44e8eeeb59eaf533.png)\n\nA payment that Radar declined\n\nWhen Stripe blocks a payment, it obtains initial authorization from the card issuer but refrains from charging the card. This precaution helps prevent potential fraudulent payments that might lead to disputes.\n\nFor some card types, customers might see the card issuer’s authorization for the payment amount on their statement. However, Stripe hasn’t charged this amount or withdrawn funds. The card issuer typically removes this authorization from the customer’s statement within a few days.\n\nIf you recognize a blocked payment as legitimate, you can lift the block by locating the payment in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/payments) and clicking **Add to allow list**. This action doesn’t retry the payment but prevents Stripe Radar from blocking future payment attempts using the same card or email address.\n\n#### Note\n\nDon’t see the **Add to allow list** button on the payment details page? [Contact Stripe](https://support.stripe.com/email) to add this feature to your Radar account.\n\nWhen using the API, the `outcome` of a blocked payment reflects the type of payment failure and the reason for it, along with the evaluated risk level.\n\n`... outcome: {   network_status: \"not_sent_to_network\",   reason: \"highest_risk_level\",   risk_level: \"highest\",   seller_message: \"Stripe blocked this charge as too risky.\",   type: \"blocked\" }, ...`\n\n## Invalid API calls ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nIn the API, you might see an invalid API call like the following:\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/charges \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d amount=2000 \\  -d currency=usd \\  -d source=tok_invalid \\   --data-urlencode description=\"Charge for jenny.rosen@example.com\"`\n\nThe invalid API call generates an error response that might look like this:\n\nThe [outcome](https://docs.stripe.com/api#charge_object-outcome) of a declined payment includes the type of payment failure and the [reason](https://docs.stripe.com/api#charge_object-outcome-reason), based on the card issuer’s decline code. The reason might contain information other than the issuer’s response code, for example, if a Radar rule evaluation blocked the charge.\n\n``... outcome: {   network_status: \"declined_by_network\",   reason: \"expired_card\",   risk_level: \"normal\",   seller_message: \"The bank returned the decline code `expired_card`.\",   type: \"issuer_declined\" }, ...``\n\nAs you develop your Stripe integration, continuously [test](https://docs.stripe.com/testing) it to identify any potential bugs that might lead to invalid API calls. Invalid API calls typically don’t result in a payment appearing in your Dashboard. However, you might see the payment appear in a few cases.\n\n`... outcome: {   network_status: \"not_sent_to_network\",   type: \"invalid\" }, ...`",

  "markdown": "# Error handling | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Catch and respond to declines, invalid data, network problems, and more.\n\nStripe offers many kinds of errors. They can reflect external events, like declined payments and network interruptions, or code problems, like invalid API calls.\n\nTo handle errors, use some or all of the techniques in the table below. No matter what technique you use, you can follow up with our [recommended responses for each error type](#error-types).\n\n| Technique | Purpose | When needed |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| [Catch exceptions](#catch-exceptions) | Recover when an API call can’t continue | Always |\n| [Monitor webhooks](#monitor-webhooks) | React to notifications from Stripe | Sometimes |\n| [Get stored information about failures](#use-stored-information) | Investigate past problems and support other techniques | Sometimes |\n\n## Catch exceptions ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nIf an immediate problem prevents an API call from continuing, the Stripe Ruby library raises an exception. It’s a best practice to catch and handle exceptions.\n\nTo catch an exception, use Ruby’s `rescue` keyword. Catch `Stripe::StripeError` or its subclasses to handle Stripe-specific exceptions only. Each subclass represents a different kind of exception. When you catch an exception, you can [use its class to choose a response](#error-types).\n\n`require 'stripe'  Stripe.api_key =` \n\n`'sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc'`\n\n`def example_function(params)   begin     Stripe::PaymentIntent.create(params)   rescue Stripe::CardError => e     puts \"A payment error occurred: #{e.error.message}\"   rescue Stripe::InvalidRequestError => e     puts \"An invalid request occurred.\"   rescue Stripe::StripeError => e     puts \"Another problem occurred, maybe unrelated to Stripe.\"   else     puts \"No error.\"   end end`\n\nAfter setting up exception handling, test it on a variety of data, including [test cards](https://docs.stripe.com/testing), to simulate different payment outcomes.\n\n`example_function(   # The required parameter currency is missing,   amount: 2000,   confirm: true,   payment_method:` \n\n`'pm_card_visa'`\n\n`, )`\n\n`An invalid request occurred.`\n\n## Monitor webhooks![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nStripe notifies you about many kinds of problems using [webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks \"webhook\"). This includes problems that don’t follow immediately after an API call. For example:\n\n*   You lose a dispute.\n*   A recurring payment fails after months of success.\n*   Your frontend [confirms](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/confirm \"confirm\") a payment, but goes offline before finding out the payment fails. (The backend still receives webhook notification, even though it wasn’t the one to make the API call.)\n\nYou don’t need to handle every webhook event type. In fact, some integrations don’t handle any.\n\nIn your webhook handler, start with the basic steps from the [webhook builder](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks/quickstart): get an event object and use the event type to find out what happened. Then, if the event type indicates an error, follow these extra steps:\n\n1.  Access [event.data.object](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/object#event_object-data-object) to retrieve the affected object.\n2.  [Use stored information](#use-stored-information) on the affected object to gain context, including an error object.\n3.  [Use its type to choose a response](#error-types).\n\n`require 'stripe' require 'sinatra' post '/webhook' do   payload = request.body.read   data = JSON.parse(payload, symbolize_names: true)    # Get the event object   event = Stripe::Event.construct_from(data)    # Use the event type to find out what happened   case event.type   when 'payment_intent.payment_failed'      # Get the object affected     payment_intent = event.data.object      # Use stored information to get an error object     e = payment_intent.last_payment_error      # Use its type to choose a response     case e.type     when 'card_error'       puts \"A payment error occurred: #{e.message}\"     when 'invalid_request'       puts \"An invalid request occurred.\"     else       puts \"Another problem occurred, maybe unrelated to Stripe.\"     end   end    content_type 'application/json'   {     status: 'success'   }.to_json end`\n\nTo test how your integration responds to webhook events, you can [trigger webhook events locally](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks#test-webhook). After completing the setup steps at that link, trigger a failed payment to see the resulting error message.\n\n`stripe trigger payment_intent.payment_failed`\n\n`A payment error occurred: Your card was declined.`\n\n## Get stored information about failures ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nMany objects store information about failures. That means that if something already went wrong, you can retrieve the object and examine it to learn more. In many cases, stored information is in the form of an error object, and you can [use its type to choose a response](#error-types).\n\nFor instance:\n\n1.  Retrieve a specific payment intent.\n2.  Check if it experienced a payment error by determining if [last\\_payment\\_error](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-last_payment_error) is empty.\n3.  If it did, log the error, including its type and the affected object.\n\n`require 'stripe' Stripe.api_key =` \n\n`'sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc'`\n\n`payment_intent = Stripe::PaymentIntent.retrieve(  '{{PAYMENT_INTENT_ID}}'  ) e = payment_intent.last_payment_error if !e.nil?   puts \"PaymentIntent #{payment_intent.id} experienced a #{e.type}.\" end`\n\nHere are common objects that store information about failures.\n\nTo test code that uses stored information about failures, you often need to simulate failed transactions. You can often do this using [test cards](https://docs.stripe.com/testing) or test bank numbers. For example:\n\n*   [Simulate a declined payment](https://docs.stripe.com/testing#declined-payments), for creating failed Charges, PaymentIntents, SetupIntents, and so on.\n*   [Simulate a failed payout](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/testing#account-numbers).\n*   [Simulate a failed refund](https://docs.stripe.com/testing#refunds).\n\n## Types of error and responses ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nIn the Stripe Ruby library, error objects belong to `stripe.error.StripeError` and its subclasses.

They come in three categories:\n\n*   [Payment blocked for suspected fraud](#payment-blocked)\n*   [Payment declined by the issuer](#payment-declined)\n*   [Other payment errors](#other-payment-errors)\n\nTo distinguish these categories or get more information about how to respond, consult the [error code](https://docs.stripe.com/error-codes), [decline code](https://docs.stripe.com/declines/codes), and [charge outcome](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/object#charge_object-outcome).\n\n(To find the charge outcome from an error object, first get the [Payment Intent that’s involved](https://docs.stripe.com/api/errors#errors-payment_intent) and the [latest Charge it created](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-latest_charge). See the example below for a demonstration.)\n\n`require 'stripe' Stripe.api_key =` \n\n`'sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc'`\n\n`def example_function(params)   begin     Stripe::PaymentIntent.create(params)   rescue Stripe::CardError => e     charge = Stripe::Charge.retrieve(e.error.payment_intent.latest_charge)     if charge.outcome.type == 'blocked'       puts 'Payment blocked for suspected fraud.'     elsif e.code == 'card_declined'       puts 'Payment declined by the issuer.'     elsif e.code == 'expired_card'       puts 'Card expired.'     else       puts 'Other card error.'     end   end end`\n\nUsers on API version [2022-08-01](https://docs.stripe.com/upgrades#2022-08-01) or older:\n\n(To find the charge outcome from an error object, first get the [Payment Intent that’s involved](https://docs.stripe.com/api/errors#errors-payment_intent) and the [latest Charge it created](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-charges-data).

We recommend that you explicitly provide the `payment_method` moving forward.\n    \n*   Email address to send the receipt to. If you specify `receipt_email` for a payment in live mode, you send a receipt regardless of your [email settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/emails).\n    \n*   Indicates that you intend to make future payments with this PaymentIntent’s payment method.\n    \n    Providing this parameter will [attach the payment method](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/save-during-payment) to the PaymentIntent’s Customer, if present, after the PaymentIntent is confirmed and any required actions from the user are complete.

In general: Codes in the `2xx` range indicate success. Codes in the `4xx` range indicate an error that failed given the information provided (e.g., a required parameter was omitted, a charge failed, etc.). Codes in the `5xx` range indicate an error with Stripe’s servers (these are rare).\n\nSome `4xx` errors that could be handled programmatically (e.g., a card is [declined](https://docs.stripe.com/declines)) include an [error code](https://docs.stripe.com/error-codes) that briefly explains the error reported.\n\n### Attributes\n\n*   The type of error returned. One of `api_error`, `card_error`, `idempotency_error`, or `invalid_request_error`\n    \n    Possible enum values\n    \n    |     |\n    | --- |\n    | `api_error` |\n    | `card_error` |\n    | `idempotency_error` |\n    | `invalid_request_error` |\n    \n*   For some errors that could be handled programmatically, a short string indicating the [error code](https://docs.stripe.com/error-codes) reported.\n    \n*   #### \n    \n    decline\\_codenullable string\n    \n*   A human-readable message providing more details about the error.

For example, you can use this to display a message near the correct form field.\n    \n*   #### \n    \n    payment\\_intentnullable object\n    \n\n### More\n\n*   #### \n    \n    payment\\_method\\_typenullable string\n    \n\n*   #### \n    \n    request\\_log\\_urlnullable string\n    \n*   #### \n    \n    setup\\_intentnullable object\n    \n\n*   #### \n    \n    payment\\_methodnullable object\n    \n\nHTTP Status Code Summary\n\n|     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 200 | OK  | Everything worked as expected. |\n| 400 | Bad Request | The request was unacceptable, often due to missing a required parameter. |\n| 401 | Unauthorized | No valid API key provided. |\n| 402 | Request Failed | The parameters were valid but the request failed. |\n| 403 | Forbidden | The API key doesn’t have permissions to perform the request. |\n| 404 | Not Found | The requested resource doesn’t exist. |\n| 409 | Conflict | The request conflicts with another request (perhaps due to using the same idempotent key). |\n| 429 | Too Many Requests | Too many requests hit the API too quickly. We recommend an exponential backoff of your requests. |\n| 500, 502, 503, 504 | Server Errors | Something went wrong on Stripe’s end. (These are rare.) |\n\nError Types\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| `api_error` | API errors cover any other type of problem (e.g., a temporary problem with Stripe’s servers), and are extremely uncommon. |\n| `card_error` | Card errors are the most common type of error you should expect to handle. They result when the user enters a card that can’t be charged for some reason. |\n| `idempotency_error` | Idempotency errors occur when an `Idempotency-Key` is re-used on a request that does not match the first request’s API endpoint and parameters. |\n| `invalid_request_error` | Invalid request errors arise when your request has invalid parameters. |\n\n## [Handling errors](https://docs.stripe.com/api/errors/handling)\n\nOur Client libraries raise exceptions for many reasons, such as a failed charge, invalid parameters, authentication errors, and network unavailability. We recommend writing code that gracefully handles all possible API exceptions.\n\n*   Related guide: [Error Handling](https://docs.stripe.com/error-handling)\n\n```\n# Select a client library to see examples of# handling different kinds of errors.\n```\n\n## [Expanding Responses](https://docs.stripe.com/api/expanding_objects)\n\nMany objects allow you to request additional information as an expanded response by using the `expand` request parameter. This parameter is available on all API requests, and applies to the response of that request only. You can expand responses in two ways.\n\nIn many cases, an object contains the ID of a related object in its response properties. For example, a `Charge` might have an associated Customer ID. You can expand these objects in line with the expand request parameter. The `expandable` label in this documentation indicates ID fields that you can expand into objects.\n\nSome available fields aren’t included in the responses by default, such as the `number` and `cvc` fields for the Issuing Card object. You can request these fields as an expanded response by using the `expand` request parameter.\n\nYou can expand recursively by specifying nested fields after a dot (`.`).

You can use this parameter to attach key-value data to these Stripe objects.\n\nYou can specify up to 50 keys, with key names up to 40 characters long and values up to 500 characters long.\n\nYou can use metadata to store additional, structured information on an object. For example, you could store your user’s full name and corresponding unique identifier from your system on a Stripe [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers) object. Stripe doesn’t use metadata—for example, we don’t use it to authorize or decline a charge and it won’t be seen by your users unless you choose to show it to them.\n\nSome of the objects listed above also support a `description` parameter. You can use the `description` parameter to annotate a charge-for example, a human-readable description such as `2 shirts for test@example.com`. Unlike `metadata`, `description` is a single string, which your users might see (for example, in email receipts Stripe sends on your behalf).\n\nDon’t store any sensitive information (bank account numbers, card details, and so on) as metadata or in the `description` parameter.\n\n*   Related guide: [Metadata](https://docs.stripe.com/metadata)\n\n## Sample metadata use cases\n\n*   **Link IDs**: Attach your system’s unique IDs to a Stripe object to simplify lookups. For example, add your order number to a charge, your user ID to a customer or recipient, or a unique receipt number to a transfer.\n*   **Refund papertrails**: Store information about the reason for a refund and the individual responsible for its creation.\n*   **Customer details**: Annotate a customer by storing an internal ID for your future use.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/customers \\  -u \"sk_test_4eC39Hq...arjtT1zdp7dcsk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc:\" \\  -d \"metadata[order_id]\"=6735\n```\n\n```\n{  \"id\": \"cus_123456789\",  \"object\": \"customer\",  \"address\": {    \"city\": \"city\",    \"country\": \"US\",    \"line1\": \"line 1\",    \"line2\": \"line 2\",    \"postal_code\": \"90210\",    \"state\": \"CA\"  },  \"balance\": 0,  \"created\": 1483565364,  \"currency\": null,  \"default_source\": null,  \"delinquent\": false,  \"description\": null,  \"discount\": null,  \"email\": null,  \"invoice_prefix\": \"C11F7E1\",  \"invoice_settings\": {    \"custom_fields\": null,    \"default_payment_method\": null,    \"footer\": null,    \"rendering_options\": null  },  \"livemode\": false,  \"metadata\": {    \"order_id\": \"6735\"  },  \"name\": null,  \"next_invoice_sequence\": 1,  \"phone\": null,  \"preferred_locales\": [],  \"shipping\": null,  \"tax_exempt\": \"none\"}\n```",

You can view and manage your API keys in [the Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/login?redirect=/apikeys).\n\nTest mode secret keys have the prefix `sk_test_` and live mode secret keys have the prefix `sk_live_`. Alternatively, you can use [restricted API keys](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#limit-access) for granular permissions.\n\nYour API keys carry many privileges, so be sure to keep them secure! Do not share your secret API keys in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, and so forth.\n\nAll API requests must be made over [HTTPS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Secure). Calls made over plain HTTP will fail. API requests without authentication will also fail.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/charges \\  -u sk_test_4eC39Hq...arjtT1zdp7dcsk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc:# The colon prevents curl from asking for a password.\n```\n\nYour API Key\n\nA sample test API key is included in all the examples here, so you can test any example right away.

Performing deep expansions on numerous list requests might result in slower processing times.\n\nExpansions have a maximum depth of four levels (for example, the deepest expansion allowed when listing charges is `data.invoice.subscription.default_source`).\n\nYou can expand multiple objects at the same time by identifying multiple items in the `expand` array.\n\n*   Related guide: [Expanding responses](https://docs.stripe.com/expand)\n*   Related video: [Expand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8Vj_CEWyQc)\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/charges/ch_3LmzzQ2eZvKYlo2C0XjzUzJV \\  -u sk_test_4eC39Hq...arjtT1zdp7dcsk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc: \\  -d \"expand[]\"=customer \\  -d \"expand[]\"=\"invoice.subscription\" \\  -G\n```\n\n```\n{  \"id\": \"ch_3LmzzQ2eZvKYlo2C0XjzUzJV\",  \"object\": \"charge\",  \"customer\": {    \"id\": \"cu_14HOpH2eZvKYlo2CxXIM7Pb2\",    \"object\": \"customer\",    // ...  },  \"invoice\": {    \"id\": \"in_1LmzzQ2eZvKYlo2CpyWn8szu\",    \"object\": \"invoice\",    \"subscription\": {      \"id\": \"su_1LmzoG2eZvKYlo2Cpw6S7dAq\",      \"object\": \"subscription\",      // ...    },    // ...  },  // ...}\n```\n\n## [Idempotent requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/idempotent_requests)\n\nThe API supports [idempotency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence) for safely retrying requests without accidentally performing the same operation twice. When creating or updating an object, use an idempotency key. Then, if a connection error occurs, you can safely repeat the request without risk of creating a second object or performing the update twice.\n\nTo perform an idempotent request, provide an additional `IdempotencyKey` element to the request options.\n\nStripe’s idempotency works by saving the resulting status code and body of the first request made for any given idempotency key, regardless of whether it succeeds or fails. Subsequent requests with the same key return the same result, including `500` errors.\n\nA client generates an idempotency key, which is a unique key that the server uses to recognize subsequent retries of the same request. How you create unique keys is up to you, but we suggest using V4 UUIDs, or another random string with enough entropy to avoid collisions. Idempotency keys are up to 255 characters long.\n\nYou can remove keys from the system automatically after they’re at least 24 hours old. We generate a new request if a key is reused after the original is pruned. The idempotency layer compares incoming parameters to those of the original request and errors if they’re the same to prevent accidental misuse.\n\nWe save results only after the execution of an endpoint begins. If incoming parameters fail validation, or the request conflicts with another request that’s executing concurrently, we don’t save the idempotent result because no API endpoint initiates the execution. You can retry these requests. Learn more about when you can [retry idempotent requests](https://docs.stripe.com/error-low-level#idempotency).\n\nAll `POST` requests accept idempotency keys. Don’t send idempotency keys in `GET` and `DELETE` requests because it has no effect. These requests are idempotent by definition.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/customers \\  -u sk_test_4eC39Hq...arjtT1zdp7dcsk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc: \\  -H \"Idempotency-Key: KG5LxwFBepaKHyUD\" \\  -d description=\"My First Test Customer (created for API docs at https://docs.stripe.com/api)\"\n```\n\n## [Metadata](https://docs.stripe.com/api/metadata)\n\nUpdateable Stripe objects—including [Account](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts), [Charge](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges), [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers), [PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents), [Refund](https://docs.stripe.com/api/refunds), [Subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions), and [Transfer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/transfers) have a `metadata` parameter.

You can retrieve it to see the balance currently on your Stripe account.\n\nYou can also retrieve the balance history, which contains a list of [transactions](https://docs.stripe.com/reporting/balance-transaction-types) that contributed to the balance (charges, payouts, and so forth).\n\nThe available and pending amounts for each currency are broken down further by payment source types.\n\nRelated guide: [Understanding Connect account balances](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-balances)\n\n## [Balance Transactions](https://docs.stripe.com/api/balance_transactions)\n\nBalance transactions represent funds moving through your Stripe account. Stripe creates them for every type of transaction that enters or leaves your Stripe account balance.\n\nRelated guide: [Balance transaction types](https://docs.stripe.com/reports/balance-transaction-types)\n\n## [Customer Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customer_sessions)\n\nA Customer Session allows you to grant Stripe’s frontend SDKs (like Stripe.js) client-side access control over a Customer.\n\n## [Disputes](https://docs.stripe.com/api/disputes)\n\nA dispute occurs when a customer questions your charge with their card issuer. When this happens, you have the opportunity to respond to the dispute with evidence that shows that the charge is legitimate.\n\nRelated guide: [Disputes and fraud](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes)\n\n## [Events](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events)\n\nEvents are our way of letting you know when something interesting happens in your account. When an interesting event occurs, we create a new `Event` object. For example, when a charge succeeds, we create a `charge.succeeded` event, and when an invoice payment attempt fails, we create an `invoice.payment_failed` event. Certain API requests might create multiple events. For example, if you create a new subscription for a customer, you receive both a `customer.subscription.created` event and a `charge.succeeded` event.\n\nEvents occur when the state of another API resource changes. The event’s data field embeds the resource’s state at the time of the change. For example, a `charge.succeeded` event contains a charge, and an `invoice.payment_failed` event contains an invoice.\n\nAs with other API resources, you can use endpoints to retrieve an [individual event](#retrieve_event) or a [list of events](#list_events) from the API. We also have a separate [webhooks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook) system for sending the `Event` objects directly to an endpoint on your server. You can manage webhooks in your [account settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/webhooks). Learn how to [listen for events](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks) so that your integration can automatically trigger reactions.\n\nWhen using [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect), you can also receive event notifications that occur in connected accounts. For these events, there’s an additional `account` attribute in the received `Event` object.\n\nWe only guarantee access to events through the [Retrieve Event API](#retrieve_event) for 30 days.\n\n## [Files](https://docs.stripe.com/api/files)\n\nThis object represents files hosted on Stripe’s servers. You can upload files with the [create file](#create_file) request (for example, when uploading dispute evidence). Stripe also creates files independently (for example, the results of a [Sigma scheduled query](#scheduled_queries)).\n\nRelated guide: [File upload guide](https://docs.stripe.com/file-upload)\n\n## [File Links](https://docs.stripe.com/api/file_links)\n\nTo share the contents of a `File` object with non-Stripe users, you can create a `FileLink`. `FileLink`s contain a URL that you can use to retrieve the contents of the file without authentication.\n\n## [Mandates](https://docs.stripe.com/api/mandates)\n\nA Mandate is a record of the permission that your customer gives you to debit their payment method.\n\n## [Setup Attempts](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_attempts)\n\nA SetupAttempt describes one attempted confirmation of a SetupIntent, whether that confirmation is successful or unsuccessful. You can use SetupAttempts to inspect details of a specific attempt at setting up a payment method using a SetupIntent.\n\n## [Confirmation Token](https://docs.stripe.com/api/confirmation_tokens)\n\nConfirmationTokens help transport client side data collected by Stripe JS over to your server for confirming a PaymentIntent or SetupIntent. If the confirmation is successful, values present on the ConfirmationToken are written onto the Intent.\n\nTo learn more about how to use ConfirmationToken, visit the related guides:\n\n*   [Finalize payments on the server](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/finalize-payments-on-the-server)\n*   [Build two-step confirmation](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/build-a-two-step-confirmation).\n\n## [Tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens)\n\nTokenization is the process Stripe uses to collect sensitive card or bank account details, or personally identifiable information (PII), directly from your customers in a secure manner. A token representing this information is returned to your server to use. Use our [recommended payments integrations](https://docs.stripe.com/payments) to perform this process on the client-side. This guarantees that no sensitive card data touches your server, and allows your integration to operate in a PCI-compliant way.\n\nIf you can’t use client-side tokenization, you can also create tokens using the API with either your publishable or secret API key. If your integration uses this method, you’re responsible for any PCI compliance that it might require, and you must keep your secret API key safe. Unlike with client-side tokenization, your customer’s information isn’t sent directly to Stripe, so we can’t determine how it’s handled or stored.\n\nYou can’t store or use tokens more than once. To store card or bank account information for later use, create [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api#customers) objects or [External accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/api#external_accounts). [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar), our integrated solution for automatic fraud protection, performs best with integrations that use client-side tokenization.\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_account)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_bank_account)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_card)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_cvc_update)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_person)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_pii)[GET/v1/tokens/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/retrieve)\n\n## [Cash Balance](https://docs.stripe.com/api/cash_balance)\n\nA customer’s `Cash balance` represents real funds. Customers can add funds to their cash balance by sending a bank transfer. These funds can be used for payment and can eventually be paid out to your bank account.\n\n## [Customer Portal Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customer_portal/sessions)\n\nThe Billing customer portal is a Stripe-hosted UI for subscription and billing management.\n\nA portal configuration describes the functionality and features that you want to provide to your customers through the portal.\n\nA portal session describes the instantiation of the customer portal for a particular customer. By visiting the session’s URL, the customer can manage their subscriptions and billing details. For security reasons, sessions are short-lived and will expire if the customer does not visit the URL. Create sessions on-demand when customers intend to manage their subscriptions and billing details.\n\nRelated guide: [Customer management](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management)\n\n## [Invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices)\n\nInvoices are statements of amounts owed by a customer, and are either generated one-off, or generated periodically from a subscription.\n\nThey contain [invoice items](#invoiceitems), and proration adjustments that may be caused by subscription upgrades/downgrades (if necessary).\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed through automatic charges, Stripe automatically finalizes your invoice and attempts payment. Note that finalizing the invoice, [when automatic](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/automatic-advancement-collection), does not happen immediately as the invoice is created. Stripe waits until one hour after the last webhook was successfully sent (or the last webhook timed out after failing). If you (and the platforms you may have connected to) have no webhooks configured, Stripe waits one hour after creation to finalize the invoice.\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed by sending an email, then based on your [email settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/billing/automatic), Stripe will email the invoice to your customer and await payment. These emails can contain a link to a hosted page to pay the invoice.\n\nStripe applies any customer credit on the account before determining the amount due for the invoice (i.e., the amount that will be actually charged). If the amount due for the invoice is less than Stripe’s [minimum allowed charge per currency](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts), the invoice is automatically marked paid, and we add the amount due to the customer’s credit balance which is applied to the next invoice.\n\nMore details on the customer’s credit balance are [here](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/customer/balance).\n\nRelated guide: [Send invoices to customers](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/invoices/sending)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create)[POST/v1/invoices/create\\_preview](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create_preview)[POST/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/lines/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_line)[GET/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/retrieve)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming)[GET/v1/invoices/:id/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming_invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/list)[DELETE/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/delete)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/add\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/add_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/remove\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/remove_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/update\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/finalize](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/finalize)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/mark\\_uncollectible](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/mark_uncollectible)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/pay](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/pay)[GET/v1/invoices/search](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/search)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/send](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/send)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/void](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/void)\n\n## [Meter Events](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event)\n\nA billing meter event represents a customer’s usage of a product. Meter events are used to bill a customer based on their usage. Meter events are associated with billing meters, which define the shape of the event’s payload and how those events are aggregated for billing.\n\n## [Meter Event Adjustment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_adjustment)\n\nA billing meter event adjustment is a resource that allows you to cancel a meter event. For example, you might create a billing meter event adjustment to cancel a meter event that was created in error or attached to the wrong customer.\n\n## [Meter Event Summary](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_summary)\n\nA billing meter event summary represents an aggregated view of a customer’s billing meter events within a specified timeframe. It indicates how much usage was accrued by a customer for that period.\n\n## [Plans](https://docs.stripe.com/api/plans)\n\nYou can now model subscriptions more flexibly using the [Prices API](#prices). It replaces the Plans API and is backwards compatible to simplify your migration.\n\nPlans define the base price, currency, and billing cycle for recurring purchases of products. [Products](#products) help you track inventory or provisioning, and plans help you track pricing. Different physical goods or levels of service should be represented by products, and pricing options should be represented by plans. This approach lets you change prices without having to change your provisioning scheme.\n\nFor example, you might have a single “gold” product that has plans for $10/month, $100/year, €9/month, and €90/year.\n\nRelated guides: [Set up a subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/set-up-subscription) and more about [products and prices](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/overview).\n\n## [Tax IDs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_create)[POST/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/create)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_retrieve)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/retrieve)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_list)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/list)[DELETE/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_delete)[DELETE/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/delete)\n\n## [Account Links](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_links)\n\nAccount Links are the means by which a Connect platform grants a connected account permission to access Stripe-hosted applications, such as Connect Onboarding.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect Onboarding](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom/hosted-onboarding)\n\n## [Account Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_sessions)\n\nAn AccountSession allows a Connect platform to grant access to a connected account in Connect embedded components.\n\nWe recommend that you create an AccountSession each time you need to display an embedded component to your user. Do not save AccountSessions to your database as they expire relatively quickly, and cannot be used more than once.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect embedded components](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-connect-embedded-components)\n\n## [Application Fees](https://docs.stripe.com/api/application_fees)\n\nWhen you collect a transaction fee on top of a charge made for your user (using [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)), an `Application Fee` object is created in your account. You can list, retrieve, and refund application fees.\n\nRelated guide: [Collecting application fees](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges#collect-fees)\n\n## [Country Specs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/country_specs)\n\nStripe needs to collect certain pieces of information about each account created. These requirements can differ depending on the account’s country. The Country Specs API makes these rules available to your integration.\n\nYou can also view the information from this API call as [an online guide](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information).\n\n## [Person](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/create)[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/update)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/retrieve)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/list)[DELETE/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/delete)\n\n## [Transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/transfers)\n\nA `Transfer` object is created when you move funds between Stripe accounts as part of Connect.\n\nBefore April 6, 2017, transfers also represented movement of funds from a Stripe account to a card or bank account. This behavior has since been split out into a [Payout](#payout_object) object, with corresponding payout endpoints. For more information, read about the [transfer/payout split](https://docs.stripe.com/transfer-payout-split).\n\nRelated guide: [Creating separate charges and transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n\n## [Secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/secret_management)\n\nSecret Store is an API that allows Stripe Apps developers to securely persist secrets for use by UI Extensions and app backends.\n\nThe primary resource in Secret Store is a `secret`. Other apps can’t view secrets created by an app. Additionally, secrets are scoped to provide further permission control.\n\nAll Dashboard users and the app backend share `account` scoped secrets. Use the `account` scope for secrets that don’t change per-user, like a third-party API key.\n\nA `user` scoped secret is accessible by the app backend and one specific Dashboard user. Use the `user` scope for per-user secrets like per-user OAuth tokens, where different users might have different permissions.\n\nRelated guide: [Store data between page reloads](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/store-auth-data-custom-objects)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[GET/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/list)[POST/v1/apps/secrets/delete](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/delete)[GET/v1/apps/secrets/find](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/find)[POST/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/set)\n\n## [Reviews](https://docs.stripe.com/api/radar/reviews)\n\nReviews can be used to supplement automated fraud detection with human expertise.\n\nLearn more about [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar) and reviewing payments [here](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/reviews).\n\n## [Authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/update)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/list)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/approve](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/approve)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/decline](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/decline)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_create)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/capture](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_capture)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/expire](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_expire)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/finalize\\_amount](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_finalize_amount)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/increment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_increment)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/fraud\\_challenges/respond](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/respond_to_fraud_challenges)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/reverse](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_reverse)\n\n## [Cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/create)[POST/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/update)[GET/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/list)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/deliver](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_deliver)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/fail](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_fail)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/return](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_return)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/ship](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_ship)\n\n## [Physical Bundles](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/physical_bundles)\n\nA Physical Bundle represents the bundle of physical items - card stock, carrier letter, and envelope - that is shipped to a cardholder when you create a physical card.\n\n## [Reader](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/terminal/readers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/create)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/update)[GET/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/retrieve)[GET/v1/terminal/readers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/list)[DELETE/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/delete)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/cancel\\_action](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/cancel_action)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/collect\\_inputs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/collect_inputs)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/confirm\\_payment\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/confirm_payment_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/collect\\_payment\\_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/collect_payment_method)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/process\\_payment\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/process_payment_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/process\\_setup\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/process_setup_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/refund\\_payment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/refund_payment)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/set\\_reader\\_display](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/set_reader_display)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/terminal/readers/:id/present\\_payment\\_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/present_payment_method)\n\n## [Terminal Hardware Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_products)Preview feature\n\nA TerminalHardwareProduct is a category of hardware devices that are generally similar, but may have variations depending on the country it’s shipped to.\n\nTerminalHardwareSKUs represent variations within the same Product (for example, a country specific device). For example, WisePOS E is a TerminalHardwareProduct and a WisePOS E - US and WisePOS E - UK are TerminalHardwareSKUs.\n\n## [Terminal Hardware SKU](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_skus)Preview feature\n\nA TerminalHardwareSKU represents a SKU for Terminal hardware. A SKU is a representation of a product available for purchase, containing information such as the name, price, and images.\n\n## [Transaction Entries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/transaction_entries)\n\nTransactionEntries represent individual units of money movements within a single [Transaction](#transactions).\n\n## [Scheduled Queries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/sigma/scheduled_queries)\n\nIf you have [scheduled a Sigma query](https://docs.stripe.com/sigma/scheduled-queries), you’ll receive a `sigma.scheduled_query_run.created` webhook each time the query runs. The webhook contains a `ScheduledQueryRun` object, which you can use to retrieve the query results.\n\n## [Report Types](https://docs.stripe.com/api/reporting/report_type)\n\nThe Report Type resource corresponds to a particular type of report, such as the “Activity summary” or “Itemized payouts” reports. These objects are identified by an ID belonging to a set of enumerated values. See [API Access to Reports documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/reporting/statements/api) for those Report Type IDs, along with required and optional parameters.\n\nNote that certain report types can only be run based on your live-mode data (not test-mode data), and will error when queried without a [live-mode API key](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#test-live-modes).\n\n## [Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/financial_connections/sessions)\n\nA Financial Connections Session is the secure way to programmatically launch the client-side Stripe.js modal that lets your users link their accounts.\n\n## [Verification Report](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_reports)\n\nA VerificationReport is the result of an attempt to collect and verify data from a user. The collection of verification checks performed is determined from the `type` and `options` parameters used. You can find the result of each verification check performed in the appropriate sub-resource: `document`, `id_number`, `selfie`.\n\nEach VerificationReport contains a copy of any data collected by the user as well as reference IDs which can be used to access collected images through the [FileUpload](https://docs.stripe.com/api/files) API. To configure and create VerificationReports, use the [VerificationSession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_sessions) API.\n\nRelated guide: [Accessing verification results](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verification-sessions#results).\n\n## [Crypto Onramp Quotes](https://docs.stripe.com/api/crypto/onramp_quotes)\n\nCrypto Onramp Quotes are estimated quotes for onramp conversions into all the different cryptocurrencies on different networks. The Quotes API allows you to display quotes in your product UI before directing the user to the onramp widget.\n\nRelated guide: [Quotes API](https://docs.stripe.com/crypto/quotes-api)\n\n## [Climate Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/climate/product)\n\nA Climate product represents a type of carbon removal unit available for reservation. You can retrieve it to see the current price and availability.\n\n## [Forwarding Request](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/request)\n\nInstructs Stripe to make a request on your behalf using the destination URL. The destination URL is activated by Stripe at the time of onboarding. Stripe verifies requests with your credentials provided during onboarding, and injects card details from the payment\\_method into the request.\n\nStripe redacts all sensitive fields and headers, including authentication credentials and card numbers, before storing the request and response data in the forwarding Request object, which are subject to a 30-day retention period.\n\nYou can provide a Stripe idempotency key to make sure that requests with the same key result in only one outbound request. The Stripe idempotency key provided should be unique and different from any idempotency keys provided on the underlying third-party request.\n\nForwarding Requests are synchronous requests that return a response or time out according to Stripe’s limits.\n\nRelated guide: [Forward card details to third-party API endpoints](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/forwarding).\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/create)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/retrieve)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/list)",

  "markdown": "# Balance | Stripe API Reference\n\nThis is an object representing your Stripe balance. You can retrieve it to see the balance currently on your Stripe account.\n\nYou can also retrieve the balance history, which contains a list of [transactions](https://docs.stripe.com/reporting/balance-transaction-types) that contributed to the balance (charges, payouts, and so forth).\n\nThe available and pending amounts for each currency are broken down further by payment source types.\n\nRelated guide: [Understanding Connect account balances](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-balances)\n\n## [The Balance object](https://docs.stripe.com/api/balance/balance_object)\n\n### Attributes\n\n*   #### \n    \n    availablearray of objects\n    \n    Available funds that you can transfer or pay out automatically by Stripe or explicitly through the [Transfers API](#transfers) or [Payouts API](#payouts). You can find the available balance for each currency and payment type in the `source_types` property.\n    \n*   Funds that aren’t available in the balance yet. You can find the pending balance for each currency and each payment type in the `source_types` property.\n    \n\n### More attributes\n\n*   #### \n    \n    connect\\_reservednullable array of objectsConnect only\n    \n*   #### \n    \n    instant\\_availablenullable array of objects\n    \n\n```\n{  \"object\": \"balance\",  \"available\": [    {      \"amount\": 666670,      \"currency\": \"usd\",      \"source_types\": {        \"card\": 666670      }    }  ],  \"connect_reserved\": [    {      \"amount\": 0,      \"currency\": \"usd\"    }  ],  \"livemode\": false,  \"pending\": [    {      \"amount\": 61414,      \"currency\": \"usd\",      \"source_types\": {        \"card\": 61414      }    }  ]}\n```\n\n## [Retrieve balance](https://docs.stripe.com/api/balance/balance_retrieve)\n\nRetrieves the current account balance, based on the authentication that was used to make the request.

Stripe creates them for every type of transaction that enters or leaves your Stripe account balance.\n\nRelated guide: [Balance transaction types](https://docs.stripe.com/reports/balance-transaction-types)\n\n## [Customer Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customer_sessions)\n\nA Customer Session allows you to grant Stripe’s frontend SDKs (like Stripe.js) client-side access control over a Customer.\n\n## [Disputes](https://docs.stripe.com/api/disputes)\n\nA dispute occurs when a customer questions your charge with their card issuer. When this happens, you have the opportunity to respond to the dispute with evidence that shows that the charge is legitimate.\n\nRelated guide: [Disputes and fraud](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes)\n\n## [Events](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events)\n\nEvents are our way of letting you know when something interesting happens in your account. When an interesting event occurs, we create a new `Event` object. For example, when a charge succeeds, we create a `charge.succeeded` event, and when an invoice payment attempt fails, we create an `invoice.payment_failed` event. Certain API requests might create multiple events. For example, if you create a new subscription for a customer, you receive both a `customer.subscription.created` event and a `charge.succeeded` event.\n\nEvents occur when the state of another API resource changes. The event’s data field embeds the resource’s state at the time of the change. For example, a `charge.succeeded` event contains a charge, and an `invoice.payment_failed` event contains an invoice.\n\nAs with other API resources, you can use endpoints to retrieve an [individual event](#retrieve_event) or a [list of events](#list_events) from the API. We also have a separate [webhooks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook) system for sending the `Event` objects directly to an endpoint on your server. You can manage webhooks in your [account settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/webhooks). Learn how to [listen for events](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks) so that your integration can automatically trigger reactions.\n\nWhen using [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect), you can also receive event notifications that occur in connected accounts. For these events, there’s an additional `account` attribute in the received `Event` object.\n\nWe only guarantee access to events through the [Retrieve Event API](#retrieve_event) for 30 days.\n\n## [Files](https://docs.stripe.com/api/files)\n\nThis object represents files hosted on Stripe’s servers. You can upload files with the [create file](#create_file) request (for example, when uploading dispute evidence). Stripe also creates files independently (for example, the results of a [Sigma scheduled query](#scheduled_queries)).\n\nRelated guide: [File upload guide](https://docs.stripe.com/file-upload)\n\n## [File Links](https://docs.stripe.com/api/file_links)\n\nTo share the contents of a `File` object with non-Stripe users, you can create a `FileLink`. `FileLink`s contain a URL that you can use to retrieve the contents of the file without authentication.\n\n## [Mandates](https://docs.stripe.com/api/mandates)\n\nA Mandate is a record of the permission that your customer gives you to debit their payment method.\n\n## [Setup Attempts](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_attempts)\n\nA SetupAttempt describes one attempted confirmation of a SetupIntent, whether that confirmation is successful or unsuccessful. You can use SetupAttempts to inspect details of a specific attempt at setting up a payment method using a SetupIntent.\n\n## [Confirmation Token](https://docs.stripe.com/api/confirmation_tokens)\n\nConfirmationTokens help transport client side data collected by Stripe JS over to your server for confirming a PaymentIntent or SetupIntent. If the confirmation is successful, values present on the ConfirmationToken are written onto the Intent.\n\nTo learn more about how to use ConfirmationToken, visit the related guides:\n\n*   [Finalize payments on the server](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/finalize-payments-on-the-server)\n*   [Build two-step confirmation](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/build-a-two-step-confirmation).\n\n## [Tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens)\n\nTokenization is the process Stripe uses to collect sensitive card or bank account details, or personally identifiable information (PII), directly from your customers in a secure manner. A token representing this information is returned to your server to use. Use our [recommended payments integrations](https://docs.stripe.com/payments) to perform this process on the client-side. This guarantees that no sensitive card data touches your server, and allows your integration to operate in a PCI-compliant way.\n\nIf you can’t use client-side tokenization, you can also create tokens using the API with either your publishable or secret API key. If your integration uses this method, you’re responsible for any PCI compliance that it might require, and you must keep your secret API key safe. Unlike with client-side tokenization, your customer’s information isn’t sent directly to Stripe, so we can’t determine how it’s handled or stored.\n\nYou can’t store or use tokens more than once. To store card or bank account information for later use, create [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api#customers) objects or [External accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/api#external_accounts). [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar), our integrated solution for automatic fraud protection, performs best with integrations that use client-side tokenization.\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_account)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_bank_account)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_card)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_cvc_update)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_person)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_pii)[GET/v1/tokens/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/retrieve)\n\n## [Cash Balance](https://docs.stripe.com/api/cash_balance)\n\nA customer’s `Cash balance` represents real funds. Customers can add funds to their cash balance by sending a bank transfer. These funds can be used for payment and can eventually be paid out to your bank account.\n\n## [Customer Portal Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customer_portal/sessions)\n\nThe Billing customer portal is a Stripe-hosted UI for subscription and billing management.\n\nA portal configuration describes the functionality and features that you want to provide to your customers through the portal.\n\nA portal session describes the instantiation of the customer portal for a particular customer. By visiting the session’s URL, the customer can manage their subscriptions and billing details. For security reasons, sessions are short-lived and will expire if the customer does not visit the URL. Create sessions on-demand when customers intend to manage their subscriptions and billing details.\n\nRelated guide: [Customer management](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management)\n\n## [Invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices)\n\nInvoices are statements of amounts owed by a customer, and are either generated one-off, or generated periodically from a subscription.\n\nThey contain [invoice items](#invoiceitems), and proration adjustments that may be caused by subscription upgrades/downgrades (if necessary).\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed through automatic charges, Stripe automatically finalizes your invoice and attempts payment. Note that finalizing the invoice, [when automatic](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/automatic-advancement-collection), does not happen immediately as the invoice is created. Stripe waits until one hour after the last webhook was successfully sent (or the last webhook timed out after failing). If you (and the platforms you may have connected to) have no webhooks configured, Stripe waits one hour after creation to finalize the invoice.\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed by sending an email, then based on your [email settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/billing/automatic), Stripe will email the invoice to your customer and await payment. These emails can contain a link to a hosted page to pay the invoice.\n\nStripe applies any customer credit on the account before determining the amount due for the invoice (i.e., the amount that will be actually charged). If the amount due for the invoice is less than Stripe’s [minimum allowed charge per currency](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts), the invoice is automatically marked paid, and we add the amount due to the customer’s credit balance which is applied to the next invoice.\n\nMore details on the customer’s credit balance are [here](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/customer/balance).\n\nRelated guide: [Send invoices to customers](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/invoices/sending)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create)[POST/v1/invoices/create\\_preview](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create_preview)[POST/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/lines/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_line)[GET/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/retrieve)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming)[GET/v1/invoices/:id/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming_invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/list)[DELETE/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/delete)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/add\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/add_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/remove\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/remove_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/update\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/finalize](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/finalize)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/mark\\_uncollectible](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/mark_uncollectible)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/pay](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/pay)[GET/v1/invoices/search](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/search)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/send](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/send)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/void](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/void)\n\n## [Meter Events](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event)\n\nA billing meter event represents a customer’s usage of a product. Meter events are used to bill a customer based on their usage. Meter events are associated with billing meters, which define the shape of the event’s payload and how those events are aggregated for billing.\n\n## [Meter Event Adjustment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_adjustment)\n\nA billing meter event adjustment is a resource that allows you to cancel a meter event. For example, you might create a billing meter event adjustment to cancel a meter event that was created in error or attached to the wrong customer.\n\n## [Meter Event Summary](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_summary)\n\nA billing meter event summary represents an aggregated view of a customer’s billing meter events within a specified timeframe. It indicates how much usage was accrued by a customer for that period.\n\n## [Plans](https://docs.stripe.com/api/plans)\n\nYou can now model subscriptions more flexibly using the [Prices API](#prices). It replaces the Plans API and is backwards compatible to simplify your migration.\n\nPlans define the base price, currency, and billing cycle for recurring purchases of products. [Products](#products) help you track inventory or provisioning, and plans help you track pricing. Different physical goods or levels of service should be represented by products, and pricing options should be represented by plans. This approach lets you change prices without having to change your provisioning scheme.\n\nFor example, you might have a single “gold” product that has plans for $10/month, $100/year, €9/month, and €90/year.\n\nRelated guides: [Set up a subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/set-up-subscription) and more about [products and prices](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/overview).\n\n## [Tax IDs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_create)[POST/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/create)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_retrieve)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/retrieve)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_list)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/list)[DELETE/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_delete)[DELETE/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/delete)\n\n## [Account Links](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_links)\n\nAccount Links are the means by which a Connect platform grants a connected account permission to access Stripe-hosted applications, such as Connect Onboarding.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect Onboarding](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom/hosted-onboarding)\n\n## [Account Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_sessions)\n\nAn AccountSession allows a Connect platform to grant access to a connected account in Connect embedded components.\n\nWe recommend that you create an AccountSession each time you need to display an embedded component to your user. Do not save AccountSessions to your database as they expire relatively quickly, and cannot be used more than once.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect embedded components](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-connect-embedded-components)\n\n## [Application Fees](https://docs.stripe.com/api/application_fees)\n\nWhen you collect a transaction fee on top of a charge made for your user (using [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)), an `Application Fee` object is created in your account. You can list, retrieve, and refund application fees.\n\nRelated guide: [Collecting application fees](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges#collect-fees)\n\n## [Country Specs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/country_specs)\n\nStripe needs to collect certain pieces of information about each account created. These requirements can differ depending on the account’s country. The Country Specs API makes these rules available to your integration.\n\nYou can also view the information from this API call as [an online guide](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information).\n\n## [Person](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/create)[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/update)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/retrieve)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/list)[DELETE/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/delete)\n\n## [Transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/transfers)\n\nA `Transfer` object is created when you move funds between Stripe accounts as part of Connect.\n\nBefore April 6, 2017, transfers also represented movement of funds from a Stripe account to a card or bank account. This behavior has since been split out into a [Payout](#payout_object) object, with corresponding payout endpoints. For more information, read about the [transfer/payout split](https://docs.stripe.com/transfer-payout-split).\n\nRelated guide: [Creating separate charges and transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n\n## [Secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/secret_management)\n\nSecret Store is an API that allows Stripe Apps developers to securely persist secrets for use by UI Extensions and app backends.\n\nThe primary resource in Secret Store is a `secret`. Other apps can’t view secrets created by an app. Additionally, secrets are scoped to provide further permission control.\n\nAll Dashboard users and the app backend share `account` scoped secrets. Use the `account` scope for secrets that don’t change per-user, like a third-party API key.\n\nA `user` scoped secret is accessible by the app backend and one specific Dashboard user. Use the `user` scope for per-user secrets like per-user OAuth tokens, where different users might have different permissions.\n\nRelated guide: [Store data between page reloads](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/store-auth-data-custom-objects)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[GET/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/list)[POST/v1/apps/secrets/delete](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/delete)[GET/v1/apps/secrets/find](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/find)[POST/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/set)\n\n## [Reviews](https://docs.stripe.com/api/radar/reviews)\n\nReviews can be used to supplement automated fraud detection with human expertise.\n\nLearn more about [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar) and reviewing payments [here](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/reviews).\n\n## [Authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/update)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/list)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/approve](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/approve)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/decline](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/decline)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_create)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/capture](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_capture)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/expire](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_expire)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/finalize\\_amount](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_finalize_amount)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/increment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_increment)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/fraud\\_challenges/respond](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/respond_to_fraud_challenges)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/reverse](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_reverse)\n\n## [Cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/create)[POST/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/update)[GET/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/list)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/deliver](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_deliver)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/fail](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_fail)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/return](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_return)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/ship](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_ship)\n\n## [Physical Bundles](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/physical_bundles)\n\nA Physical Bundle represents the bundle of physical items - card stock, carrier letter, and envelope - that is shipped to a cardholder when you create a physical card.\n\n## [Reader](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/terminal/readers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/create)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/update)[GET/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/retrieve)[GET/v1/terminal/readers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/list)[DELETE/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/delete)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/cancel\\_action](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/cancel_action)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/collect\\_inputs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/collect_inputs)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/confirm\\_payment\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/confirm_payment_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/collect\\_payment\\_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/collect_payment_method)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/process\\_payment\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/process_payment_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/process\\_setup\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/process_setup_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/refund\\_payment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/refund_payment)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/set\\_reader\\_display](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/set_reader_display)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/terminal/readers/:id/present\\_payment\\_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/present_payment_method)\n\n## [Terminal Hardware Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_products)Preview feature\n\nA TerminalHardwareProduct is a category of hardware devices that are generally similar, but may have variations depending on the country it’s shipped to.\n\nTerminalHardwareSKUs represent variations within the same Product (for example, a country specific device). For example, WisePOS E is a TerminalHardwareProduct and a WisePOS E - US and WisePOS E - UK are TerminalHardwareSKUs.\n\n## [Terminal Hardware SKU](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_skus)Preview feature\n\nA TerminalHardwareSKU represents a SKU for Terminal hardware. A SKU is a representation of a product available for purchase, containing information such as the name, price, and images.\n\n## [Transaction Entries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/transaction_entries)\n\nTransactionEntries represent individual units of money movements within a single [Transaction](#transactions).\n\n## [Scheduled Queries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/sigma/scheduled_queries)\n\nIf you have [scheduled a Sigma query](https://docs.stripe.com/sigma/scheduled-queries), you’ll receive a `sigma.scheduled_query_run.created` webhook each time the query runs. The webhook contains a `ScheduledQueryRun` object, which you can use to retrieve the query results.\n\n## [Report Types](https://docs.stripe.com/api/reporting/report_type)\n\nThe Report Type resource corresponds to a particular type of report, such as the “Activity summary” or “Itemized payouts” reports. These objects are identified by an ID belonging to a set of enumerated values. See [API Access to Reports documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/reporting/statements/api) for those Report Type IDs, along with required and optional parameters.\n\nNote that certain report types can only be run based on your live-mode data (not test-mode data), and will error when queried without a [live-mode API key](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#test-live-modes).\n\n## [Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/financial_connections/sessions)\n\nA Financial Connections Session is the secure way to programmatically launch the client-side Stripe.js modal that lets your users link their accounts.\n\n## [Verification Report](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_reports)\n\nA VerificationReport is the result of an attempt to collect and verify data from a user. The collection of verification checks performed is determined from the `type` and `options` parameters used. You can find the result of each verification check performed in the appropriate sub-resource: `document`, `id_number`, `selfie`.\n\nEach VerificationReport contains a copy of any data collected by the user as well as reference IDs which can be used to access collected images through the [FileUpload](https://docs.stripe.com/api/files) API. To configure and create VerificationReports, use the [VerificationSession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_sessions) API.\n\nRelated guide: [Accessing verification results](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verification-sessions#results).\n\n## [Crypto Onramp Quotes](https://docs.stripe.com/api/crypto/onramp_quotes)\n\nCrypto Onramp Quotes are estimated quotes for onramp conversions into all the different cryptocurrencies on different networks. The Quotes API allows you to display quotes in your product UI before directing the user to the onramp widget.\n\nRelated guide: [Quotes API](https://docs.stripe.com/crypto/quotes-api)\n\n## [Climate Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/climate/product)\n\nA Climate product represents a type of carbon removal unit available for reservation. You can retrieve it to see the current price and availability.\n\n## [Forwarding Request](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/request)\n\nInstructs Stripe to make a request on your behalf using the destination URL. The destination URL is activated by Stripe at the time of onboarding. Stripe verifies requests with your credentials provided during onboarding, and injects card details from the payment\\_method into the request.\n\nStripe redacts all sensitive fields and headers, including authentication credentials and card numbers, before storing the request and response data in the forwarding Request object, which are subject to a 30-day retention period.\n\nYou can provide a Stripe idempotency key to make sure that requests with the same key result in only one outbound request. The Stripe idempotency key provided should be unique and different from any idempotency keys provided on the underlying third-party request.\n\nForwarding Requests are synchronous requests that return a response or time out according to Stripe’s limits.\n\nRelated guide: [Forward card details to third-party API endpoints](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/forwarding).\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/create)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/retrieve)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/list)",

Any parameters not provided will be left unchanged. For example, if you pass the **source** parameter, that becomes the customer’s active source (e.g., a card) to be used for all charges in the future. When you update a customer to a new valid card source by passing the **source** parameter: for each of the customer’s current subscriptions, if the subscription bills automatically and is in the `past_due` state, then the latest open invoice for the subscription with automatic collection enabled will be retried. This retry will not count as an automatic retry, and will not affect the next regularly scheduled payment for the invoice. Changing the **default\\_source** for a customer will not trigger this behavior.\n\nThis request accepts mostly the same arguments as the customer creation call.\n\n### Parameters\n\n*   An arbitrary string that you can attach to a customer object. It is displayed alongside the customer in the dashboard.\n    \n*   Customer’s email address. It’s displayed alongside the customer in your dashboard and can be useful for searching and tracking. This may be up to _512 characters_.\n    \n*   Set of [key-value pairs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/metadata) that you can attach to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format. Individual keys can be unset by posting an empty value to them.

You can retrieve it to see the balance currently on your Stripe account.\n\nYou can also retrieve the balance history, which contains a list of [transactions](https://docs.stripe.com/reporting/balance-transaction-types) that contributed to the balance (charges, payouts, and so forth).\n\nThe available and pending amounts for each currency are broken down further by payment source types.\n\nRelated guide: [Understanding Connect account balances](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-balances)\n\n## [Balance Transactions](https://docs.stripe.com/api/balance_transactions)\n\nBalance transactions represent funds moving through your Stripe account. Stripe creates them for every type of transaction that enters or leaves your Stripe account balance.\n\nRelated guide: [Balance transaction types](https://docs.stripe.com/reports/balance-transaction-types)\n\n## [Customer Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customer_sessions)\n\nA Customer Session allows you to grant Stripe’s frontend SDKs (like Stripe.js) client-side access control over a Customer.\n\n## [Disputes](https://docs.stripe.com/api/disputes)\n\nA dispute occurs when a customer questions your charge with their card issuer. When this happens, you have the opportunity to respond to the dispute with evidence that shows that the charge is legitimate.\n\nRelated guide: [Disputes and fraud](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes)\n\n## [Events](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events)\n\nEvents are our way of letting you know when something interesting happens in your account. When an interesting event occurs, we create a new `Event` object. For example, when a charge succeeds, we create a `charge.succeeded` event, and when an invoice payment attempt fails, we create an `invoice.payment_failed` event. Certain API requests might create multiple events. For example, if you create a new subscription for a customer, you receive both a `customer.subscription.created` event and a `charge.succeeded` event.\n\nEvents occur when the state of another API resource changes. The event’s data field embeds the resource’s state at the time of the change. For example, a `charge.succeeded` event contains a charge, and an `invoice.payment_failed` event contains an invoice.\n\nAs with other API resources, you can use endpoints to retrieve an [individual event](#retrieve_event) or a [list of events](#list_events) from the API. We also have a separate [webhooks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook) system for sending the `Event` objects directly to an endpoint on your server. You can manage webhooks in your [account settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/webhooks). Learn how to [listen for events](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks) so that your integration can automatically trigger reactions.\n\nWhen using [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect), you can also receive event notifications that occur in connected accounts. For these events, there’s an additional `account` attribute in the received `Event` object.\n\nWe only guarantee access to events through the [Retrieve Event API](#retrieve_event) for 30 days.\n\n## [Files](https://docs.stripe.com/api/files)\n\nThis object represents files hosted on Stripe’s servers. You can upload files with the [create file](#create_file) request (for example, when uploading dispute evidence). Stripe also creates files independently (for example, the results of a [Sigma scheduled query](#scheduled_queries)).\n\nRelated guide: [File upload guide](https://docs.stripe.com/file-upload)\n\n## [File Links](https://docs.stripe.com/api/file_links)\n\nTo share the contents of a `File` object with non-Stripe users, you can create a `FileLink`. `FileLink`s contain a URL that you can use to retrieve the contents of the file without authentication.\n\n## [Mandates](https://docs.stripe.com/api/mandates)\n\nA Mandate is a record of the permission that your customer gives you to debit their payment method.\n\n## [Setup Attempts](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_attempts)\n\nA SetupAttempt describes one attempted confirmation of a SetupIntent, whether that confirmation is successful or unsuccessful. You can use SetupAttempts to inspect details of a specific attempt at setting up a payment method using a SetupIntent.\n\n## [Confirmation Token](https://docs.stripe.com/api/confirmation_tokens)\n\nConfirmationTokens help transport client side data collected by Stripe JS over to your server for confirming a PaymentIntent or SetupIntent. If the confirmation is successful, values present on the ConfirmationToken are written onto the Intent.\n\nTo learn more about how to use ConfirmationToken, visit the related guides:\n\n*   [Finalize payments on the server](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/finalize-payments-on-the-server)\n*   [Build two-step confirmation](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/build-a-two-step-confirmation).\n\n## [Tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens)\n\nTokenization is the process Stripe uses to collect sensitive card or bank account details, or personally identifiable information (PII), directly from your customers in a secure manner. A token representing this information is returned to your server to use. Use our [recommended payments integrations](https://docs.stripe.com/payments) to perform this process on the client-side. This guarantees that no sensitive card data touches your server, and allows your integration to operate in a PCI-compliant way.\n\nIf you can’t use client-side tokenization, you can also create tokens using the API with either your publishable or secret API key. If your integration uses this method, you’re responsible for any PCI compliance that it might require, and you must keep your secret API key safe. Unlike with client-side tokenization, your customer’s information isn’t sent directly to Stripe, so we can’t determine how it’s handled or stored.\n\nYou can’t store or use tokens more than once. To store card or bank account information for later use, create [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api#customers) objects or [External accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/api#external_accounts). [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar), our integrated solution for automatic fraud protection, performs best with integrations that use client-side tokenization.\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_account)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_bank_account)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_card)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_cvc_update)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_person)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_pii)[GET/v1/tokens/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/retrieve)\n\n## [Cash Balance](https://docs.stripe.com/api/cash_balance)\n\nA customer’s `Cash balance` represents real funds. Customers can add funds to their cash balance by sending a bank transfer. These funds can be used for payment and can eventually be paid out to your bank account.\n\n## [Customer Portal Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customer_portal/sessions)\n\nThe Billing customer portal is a Stripe-hosted UI for subscription and billing management.\n\nA portal configuration describes the functionality and features that you want to provide to your customers through the portal.\n\nA portal session describes the instantiation of the customer portal for a particular customer. By visiting the session’s URL, the customer can manage their subscriptions and billing details. For security reasons, sessions are short-lived and will expire if the customer does not visit the URL. Create sessions on-demand when customers intend to manage their subscriptions and billing details.\n\nRelated guide: [Customer management](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management)\n\n## [Invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices)\n\nInvoices are statements of amounts owed by a customer, and are either generated one-off, or generated periodically from a subscription.\n\nThey contain [invoice items](#invoiceitems), and proration adjustments that may be caused by subscription upgrades/downgrades (if necessary).\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed through automatic charges, Stripe automatically finalizes your invoice and attempts payment. Note that finalizing the invoice, [when automatic](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/automatic-advancement-collection), does not happen immediately as the invoice is created. Stripe waits until one hour after the last webhook was successfully sent (or the last webhook timed out after failing). If you (and the platforms you may have connected to) have no webhooks configured, Stripe waits one hour after creation to finalize the invoice.\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed by sending an email, then based on your [email settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/billing/automatic), Stripe will email the invoice to your customer and await payment. These emails can contain a link to a hosted page to pay the invoice.\n\nStripe applies any customer credit on the account before determining the amount due for the invoice (i.e., the amount that will be actually charged). If the amount due for the invoice is less than Stripe’s [minimum allowed charge per currency](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts), the invoice is automatically marked paid, and we add the amount due to the customer’s credit balance which is applied to the next invoice.\n\nMore details on the customer’s credit balance are [here](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/customer/balance).\n\nRelated guide: [Send invoices to customers](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/invoices/sending)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create)[POST/v1/invoices/create\\_preview](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create_preview)[POST/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/lines/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_line)[GET/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/retrieve)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming)[GET/v1/invoices/:id/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming_invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/list)[DELETE/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/delete)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/add\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/add_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/remove\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/remove_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/update\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/finalize](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/finalize)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/mark\\_uncollectible](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/mark_uncollectible)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/pay](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/pay)[GET/v1/invoices/search](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/search)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/send](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/send)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/void](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/void)\n\n## [Meter Events](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event)\n\nA billing meter event represents a customer’s usage of a product. Meter events are used to bill a customer based on their usage. Meter events are associated with billing meters, which define the shape of the event’s payload and how those events are aggregated for billing.\n\n## [Meter Event Adjustment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_adjustment)\n\nA billing meter event adjustment is a resource that allows you to cancel a meter event. For example, you might create a billing meter event adjustment to cancel a meter event that was created in error or attached to the wrong customer.\n\n## [Meter Event Summary](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_summary)\n\nA billing meter event summary represents an aggregated view of a customer’s billing meter events within a specified timeframe. It indicates how much usage was accrued by a customer for that period.\n\n## [Plans](https://docs.stripe.com/api/plans)\n\nYou can now model subscriptions more flexibly using the [Prices API](#prices). It replaces the Plans API and is backwards compatible to simplify your migration.\n\nPlans define the base price, currency, and billing cycle for recurring purchases of products. [Products](#products) help you track inventory or provisioning, and plans help you track pricing. Different physical goods or levels of service should be represented by products, and pricing options should be represented by plans. This approach lets you change prices without having to change your provisioning scheme.\n\nFor example, you might have a single “gold” product that has plans for $10/month, $100/year, €9/month, and €90/year.\n\nRelated guides: [Set up a subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/set-up-subscription) and more about [products and prices](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/overview).\n\n## [Tax IDs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_create)[POST/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/create)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_retrieve)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/retrieve)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_list)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/list)[DELETE/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_delete)[DELETE/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/delete)\n\n## [Account Links](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_links)\n\nAccount Links are the means by which a Connect platform grants a connected account permission to access Stripe-hosted applications, such as Connect Onboarding.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect Onboarding](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom/hosted-onboarding)\n\n## [Account Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_sessions)\n\nAn AccountSession allows a Connect platform to grant access to a connected account in Connect embedded components.\n\nWe recommend that you create an AccountSession each time you need to display an embedded component to your user. Do not save AccountSessions to your database as they expire relatively quickly, and cannot be used more than once.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect embedded components](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-connect-embedded-components)\n\n## [Application Fees](https://docs.stripe.com/api/application_fees)\n\nWhen you collect a transaction fee on top of a charge made for your user (using [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)), an `Application Fee` object is created in your account. You can list, retrieve, and refund application fees.\n\nRelated guide: [Collecting application fees](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges#collect-fees)\n\n## [Country Specs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/country_specs)\n\nStripe needs to collect certain pieces of information about each account created. These requirements can differ depending on the account’s country. The Country Specs API makes these rules available to your integration.\n\nYou can also view the information from this API call as [an online guide](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information).\n\n## [Person](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/create)[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/update)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/retrieve)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/list)[DELETE/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/delete)\n\n## [Transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/transfers)\n\nA `Transfer` object is created when you move funds between Stripe accounts as part of Connect.\n\nBefore April 6, 2017, transfers also represented movement of funds from a Stripe account to a card or bank account. This behavior has since been split out into a [Payout](#payout_object) object, with corresponding payout endpoints. For more information, read about the [transfer/payout split](https://docs.stripe.com/transfer-payout-split).\n\nRelated guide: [Creating separate charges and transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n\n## [Secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/secret_management)\n\nSecret Store is an API that allows Stripe Apps developers to securely persist secrets for use by UI Extensions and app backends.\n\nThe primary resource in Secret Store is a `secret`. Other apps can’t view secrets created by an app. Additionally, secrets are scoped to provide further permission control.\n\nAll Dashboard users and the app backend share `account` scoped secrets. Use the `account` scope for secrets that don’t change per-user, like a third-party API key.\n\nA `user` scoped secret is accessible by the app backend and one specific Dashboard user. Use the `user` scope for per-user secrets like per-user OAuth tokens, where different users might have different permissions.\n\nRelated guide: [Store data between page reloads](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/store-auth-data-custom-objects)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[GET/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/list)[POST/v1/apps/secrets/delete](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/delete)[GET/v1/apps/secrets/find](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/find)[POST/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/set)\n\n## [Reviews](https://docs.stripe.com/api/radar/reviews)\n\nReviews can be used to supplement automated fraud detection with human expertise.\n\nLearn more about [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar) and reviewing payments [here](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/reviews).\n\n## [Authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/update)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/list)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/approve](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/approve)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/decline](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/decline)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_create)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/capture](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_capture)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/expire](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_expire)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/finalize\\_amount](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_finalize_amount)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/increment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_increment)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/fraud\\_challenges/respond](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/respond_to_fraud_challenges)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/reverse](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_reverse)\n\n## [Cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/create)[POST/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/update)[GET/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/list)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/deliver](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_deliver)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/fail](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_fail)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/return](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_return)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/ship](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_ship)\n\n## [Physical Bundles](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/physical_bundles)\n\nA Physical Bundle represents the bundle of physical items - card stock, carrier letter, and envelope - that is shipped to a cardholder when you create a physical card.\n\n## [Reader](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/terminal/readers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/create)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/update)[GET/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/retrieve)[GET/v1/terminal/readers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/list)[DELETE/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/delete)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/cancel\\_action](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/cancel_action)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/collect\\_inputs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/collect_inputs)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/confirm\\_payment\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/confirm_payment_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/collect\\_payment\\_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/collect_payment_method)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/process\\_payment\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/process_payment_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/process\\_setup\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/process_setup_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/refund\\_payment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/refund_payment)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/set\\_reader\\_display](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/set_reader_display)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/terminal/readers/:id/present\\_payment\\_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/present_payment_method)\n\n## [Terminal Hardware Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_products)Preview feature\n\nA TerminalHardwareProduct is a category of hardware devices that are generally similar, but may have variations depending on the country it’s shipped to.\n\nTerminalHardwareSKUs represent variations within the same Product (for example, a country specific device). For example, WisePOS E is a TerminalHardwareProduct and a WisePOS E - US and WisePOS E - UK are TerminalHardwareSKUs.\n\n## [Terminal Hardware SKU](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_skus)Preview feature\n\nA TerminalHardwareSKU represents a SKU for Terminal hardware. A SKU is a representation of a product available for purchase, containing information such as the name, price, and images.\n\n## [Transaction Entries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/transaction_entries)\n\nTransactionEntries represent individual units of money movements within a single [Transaction](#transactions).\n\n## [Scheduled Queries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/sigma/scheduled_queries)\n\nIf you have [scheduled a Sigma query](https://docs.stripe.com/sigma/scheduled-queries), you’ll receive a `sigma.scheduled_query_run.created` webhook each time the query runs. The webhook contains a `ScheduledQueryRun` object, which you can use to retrieve the query results.\n\n## [Report Types](https://docs.stripe.com/api/reporting/report_type)\n\nThe Report Type resource corresponds to a particular type of report, such as the “Activity summary” or “Itemized payouts” reports. These objects are identified by an ID belonging to a set of enumerated values. See [API Access to Reports documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/reporting/statements/api) for those Report Type IDs, along with required and optional parameters.\n\nNote that certain report types can only be run based on your live-mode data (not test-mode data), and will error when queried without a [live-mode API key](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#test-live-modes).\n\n## [Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/financial_connections/sessions)\n\nA Financial Connections Session is the secure way to programmatically launch the client-side Stripe.js modal that lets your users link their accounts.\n\n## [Verification Report](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_reports)\n\nA VerificationReport is the result of an attempt to collect and verify data from a user. The collection of verification checks performed is determined from the `type` and `options` parameters used. You can find the result of each verification check performed in the appropriate sub-resource: `document`, `id_number`, `selfie`.\n\nEach VerificationReport contains a copy of any data collected by the user as well as reference IDs which can be used to access collected images through the [FileUpload](https://docs.stripe.com/api/files) API. To configure and create VerificationReports, use the [VerificationSession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_sessions) API.\n\nRelated guide: [Accessing verification results](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verification-sessions#results).\n\n## [Crypto Onramp Quotes](https://docs.stripe.com/api/crypto/onramp_quotes)\n\nCrypto Onramp Quotes are estimated quotes for onramp conversions into all the different cryptocurrencies on different networks. The Quotes API allows you to display quotes in your product UI before directing the user to the onramp widget.\n\nRelated guide: [Quotes API](https://docs.stripe.com/crypto/quotes-api)\n\n## [Climate Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/climate/product)\n\nA Climate product represents a type of carbon removal unit available for reservation. You can retrieve it to see the current price and availability.\n\n## [Forwarding Request](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/request)\n\nInstructs Stripe to make a request on your behalf using the destination URL. The destination URL is activated by Stripe at the time of onboarding. Stripe verifies requests with your credentials provided during onboarding, and injects card details from the payment\\_method into the request.\n\nStripe redacts all sensitive fields and headers, including authentication credentials and card numbers, before storing the request and response data in the forwarding Request object, which are subject to a 30-day retention period.\n\nYou can provide a Stripe idempotency key to make sure that requests with the same key result in only one outbound request. The Stripe idempotency key provided should be unique and different from any idempotency keys provided on the underlying third-party request.\n\nForwarding Requests are synchronous requests that return a response or time out according to Stripe’s limits.\n\nRelated guide: [Forward card details to third-party API endpoints](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/forwarding).\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/create)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/retrieve)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/list)",

Stripe creates them for every type of transaction that enters or leaves your Stripe account balance.\n\nRelated guide: [Balance transaction types](https://docs.stripe.com/reports/balance-transaction-types)\n\n## [The Balance Transaction object](https://docs.stripe.com/api/balance_transactions/object)\n\n### Attributes\n\n*   Unique identifier for the object.\n    \n*   Gross amount of this transaction (in cents). A positive value represents funds charged to another party, and a negative value represents funds sent to another party.\n    \n\n*   #### \n    \n    descriptionnullable string\n    \n    An arbitrary string attached to the object. Often useful for displaying to users.\n    \n*   Fees (in cents) paid for this transaction. Represented as a positive integer when assessed.\n    \n*   #### \n    \n    fee\\_detailsarray of objects\n    \n    Detailed breakdown of fees (in cents) paid for this transaction.\n    \n*   Net impact to a Stripe balance (in cents). A positive value represents incrementing a Stripe balance, and a negative value decrementing a Stripe balance. You can calculate the net impact of a transaction on a balance by `amount` - `fee`\n    \n*   #### \n    \n    sourcenullable stringExpandable\n    \n    This transaction relates to the Stripe object.\n    \n*   The transaction’s net funds status in the Stripe balance, which are either `available` or `pending`.\n    \n*   Transaction type: `adjustment`, `advance`, `advance_funding`, `anticipation_repayment`, `application_fee`, `application_fee_refund`, `charge`, `climate_order_purchase`, `climate_order_refund`, `connect_collection_transfer`, `contribution`, `issuing_authorization_hold`, `issuing_authorization_release`, `issuing_dispute`, `issuing_transaction`, `obligation_outbound`, `obligation_reversal_inbound`, `payment`, `payment_failure_refund`, `payment_network_reserve_hold`, `payment_network_reserve_release`, `payment_refund`, `payment_reversal`, `payment_unreconciled`, `payout`, `payout_cancel`, `payout_failure`, `refund`, `refund_failure`, `reserve_transaction`, `reserved_funds`, `stripe_fee`, `stripe_fx_fee`, `tax_fee`, `topup`, `topup_reversal`, `transfer`, `transfer_cancel`, `transfer_failure`, or `transfer_refund`.

When this happens, you have the opportunity to respond to the dispute with evidence that shows that the charge is legitimate.\n\nRelated guide: [Disputes and fraud](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes)\n\n## [Events](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events)\n\nEvents are our way of letting you know when something interesting happens in your account. When an interesting event occurs, we create a new `Event` object. For example, when a charge succeeds, we create a `charge.succeeded` event, and when an invoice payment attempt fails, we create an `invoice.payment_failed` event. Certain API requests might create multiple events. For example, if you create a new subscription for a customer, you receive both a `customer.subscription.created` event and a `charge.succeeded` event.\n\nEvents occur when the state of another API resource changes. The event’s data field embeds the resource’s state at the time of the change. For example, a `charge.succeeded` event contains a charge, and an `invoice.payment_failed` event contains an invoice.\n\nAs with other API resources, you can use endpoints to retrieve an [individual event](#retrieve_event) or a [list of events](#list_events) from the API. We also have a separate [webhooks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook) system for sending the `Event` objects directly to an endpoint on your server. You can manage webhooks in your [account settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/webhooks). Learn how to [listen for events](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks) so that your integration can automatically trigger reactions.\n\nWhen using [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect), you can also receive event notifications that occur in connected accounts. For these events, there’s an additional `account` attribute in the received `Event` object.\n\nWe only guarantee access to events through the [Retrieve Event API](#retrieve_event) for 30 days.\n\n## [Files](https://docs.stripe.com/api/files)\n\nThis object represents files hosted on Stripe’s servers. You can upload files with the [create file](#create_file) request (for example, when uploading dispute evidence). Stripe also creates files independently (for example, the results of a [Sigma scheduled query](#scheduled_queries)).\n\nRelated guide: [File upload guide](https://docs.stripe.com/file-upload)\n\n## [File Links](https://docs.stripe.com/api/file_links)\n\nTo share the contents of a `File` object with non-Stripe users, you can create a `FileLink`. `FileLink`s contain a URL that you can use to retrieve the contents of the file without authentication.\n\n## [Mandates](https://docs.stripe.com/api/mandates)\n\nA Mandate is a record of the permission that your customer gives you to debit their payment method.\n\n## [Setup Attempts](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_attempts)\n\nA SetupAttempt describes one attempted confirmation of a SetupIntent, whether that confirmation is successful or unsuccessful. You can use SetupAttempts to inspect details of a specific attempt at setting up a payment method using a SetupIntent.\n\n## [Confirmation Token](https://docs.stripe.com/api/confirmation_tokens)\n\nConfirmationTokens help transport client side data collected by Stripe JS over to your server for confirming a PaymentIntent or SetupIntent. If the confirmation is successful, values present on the ConfirmationToken are written onto the Intent.\n\nTo learn more about how to use ConfirmationToken, visit the related guides:\n\n*   [Finalize payments on the server](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/finalize-payments-on-the-server)\n*   [Build two-step confirmation](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/build-a-two-step-confirmation).\n\n## [Tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens)\n\nTokenization is the process Stripe uses to collect sensitive card or bank account details, or personally identifiable information (PII), directly from your customers in a secure manner. A token representing this information is returned to your server to use. Use our [recommended payments integrations](https://docs.stripe.com/payments) to perform this process on the client-side. This guarantees that no sensitive card data touches your server, and allows your integration to operate in a PCI-compliant way.\n\nIf you can’t use client-side tokenization, you can also create tokens using the API with either your publishable or secret API key. If your integration uses this method, you’re responsible for any PCI compliance that it might require, and you must keep your secret API key safe. Unlike with client-side tokenization, your customer’s information isn’t sent directly to Stripe, so we can’t determine how it’s handled or stored.\n\nYou can’t store or use tokens more than once. To store card or bank account information for later use, create [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api#customers) objects or [External accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/api#external_accounts). [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar), our integrated solution for automatic fraud protection, performs best with integrations that use client-side tokenization.\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_account)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_bank_account)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_card)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_cvc_update)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_person)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_pii)[GET/v1/tokens/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/retrieve)\n\n## [Cash Balance](https://docs.stripe.com/api/cash_balance)\n\nA customer’s `Cash balance` represents real funds. Customers can add funds to their cash balance by sending a bank transfer. These funds can be used for payment and can eventually be paid out to your bank account.\n\n## [Customer Portal Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customer_portal/sessions)\n\nThe Billing customer portal is a Stripe-hosted UI for subscription and billing management.\n\nA portal configuration describes the functionality and features that you want to provide to your customers through the portal.\n\nA portal session describes the instantiation of the customer portal for a particular customer. By visiting the session’s URL, the customer can manage their subscriptions and billing details. For security reasons, sessions are short-lived and will expire if the customer does not visit the URL. Create sessions on-demand when customers intend to manage their subscriptions and billing details.\n\nRelated guide: [Customer management](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management)\n\n## [Invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices)\n\nInvoices are statements of amounts owed by a customer, and are either generated one-off, or generated periodically from a subscription.\n\nThey contain [invoice items](#invoiceitems), and proration adjustments that may be caused by subscription upgrades/downgrades (if necessary).\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed through automatic charges, Stripe automatically finalizes your invoice and attempts payment. Note that finalizing the invoice, [when automatic](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/automatic-advancement-collection), does not happen immediately as the invoice is created. Stripe waits until one hour after the last webhook was successfully sent (or the last webhook timed out after failing). If you (and the platforms you may have connected to) have no webhooks configured, Stripe waits one hour after creation to finalize the invoice.\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed by sending an email, then based on your [email settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/billing/automatic), Stripe will email the invoice to your customer and await payment. These emails can contain a link to a hosted page to pay the invoice.\n\nStripe applies any customer credit on the account before determining the amount due for the invoice (i.e., the amount that will be actually charged). If the amount due for the invoice is less than Stripe’s [minimum allowed charge per currency](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts), the invoice is automatically marked paid, and we add the amount due to the customer’s credit balance which is applied to the next invoice.\n\nMore details on the customer’s credit balance are [here](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/customer/balance).\n\nRelated guide: [Send invoices to customers](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/invoices/sending)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create)[POST/v1/invoices/create\\_preview](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create_preview)[POST/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/lines/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_line)[GET/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/retrieve)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming)[GET/v1/invoices/:id/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming_invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/list)[DELETE/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/delete)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/add\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/add_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/remove\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/remove_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/update\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/finalize](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/finalize)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/mark\\_uncollectible](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/mark_uncollectible)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/pay](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/pay)[GET/v1/invoices/search](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/search)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/send](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/send)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/void](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/void)\n\n## [Meter Events](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event)\n\nA billing meter event represents a customer’s usage of a product. Meter events are used to bill a customer based on their usage. Meter events are associated with billing meters, which define the shape of the event’s payload and how those events are aggregated for billing.\n\n## [Meter Event Adjustment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_adjustment)\n\nA billing meter event adjustment is a resource that allows you to cancel a meter event. For example, you might create a billing meter event adjustment to cancel a meter event that was created in error or attached to the wrong customer.\n\n## [Meter Event Summary](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_summary)\n\nA billing meter event summary represents an aggregated view of a customer’s billing meter events within a specified timeframe. It indicates how much usage was accrued by a customer for that period.\n\n## [Plans](https://docs.stripe.com/api/plans)\n\nYou can now model subscriptions more flexibly using the [Prices API](#prices). It replaces the Plans API and is backwards compatible to simplify your migration.\n\nPlans define the base price, currency, and billing cycle for recurring purchases of products. [Products](#products) help you track inventory or provisioning, and plans help you track pricing. Different physical goods or levels of service should be represented by products, and pricing options should be represented by plans. This approach lets you change prices without having to change your provisioning scheme.\n\nFor example, you might have a single “gold” product that has plans for $10/month, $100/year, €9/month, and €90/year.\n\nRelated guides: [Set up a subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/set-up-subscription) and more about [products and prices](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/overview).\n\n## [Tax IDs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_create)[POST/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/create)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_retrieve)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/retrieve)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_list)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/list)[DELETE/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_delete)[DELETE/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/delete)\n\n## [Account Links](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_links)\n\nAccount Links are the means by which a Connect platform grants a connected account permission to access Stripe-hosted applications, such as Connect Onboarding.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect Onboarding](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom/hosted-onboarding)\n\n## [Account Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_sessions)\n\nAn AccountSession allows a Connect platform to grant access to a connected account in Connect embedded components.\n\nWe recommend that you create an AccountSession each time you need to display an embedded component to your user. Do not save AccountSessions to your database as they expire relatively quickly, and cannot be used more than once.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect embedded components](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-connect-embedded-components)\n\n## [Application Fees](https://docs.stripe.com/api/application_fees)\n\nWhen you collect a transaction fee on top of a charge made for your user (using [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)), an `Application Fee` object is created in your account. You can list, retrieve, and refund application fees.\n\nRelated guide: [Collecting application fees](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges#collect-fees)\n\n## [Country Specs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/country_specs)\n\nStripe needs to collect certain pieces of information about each account created. These requirements can differ depending on the account’s country. The Country Specs API makes these rules available to your integration.\n\nYou can also view the information from this API call as [an online guide](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information).\n\n## [Person](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/create)[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/update)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/retrieve)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/list)[DELETE/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/delete)\n\n## [Transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/transfers)\n\nA `Transfer` object is created when you move funds between Stripe accounts as part of Connect.\n\nBefore April 6, 2017, transfers also represented movement of funds from a Stripe account to a card or bank account. This behavior has since been split out into a [Payout](#payout_object) object, with corresponding payout endpoints. For more information, read about the [transfer/payout split](https://docs.stripe.com/transfer-payout-split).\n\nRelated guide: [Creating separate charges and transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n\n## [Secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/secret_management)\n\nSecret Store is an API that allows Stripe Apps developers to securely persist secrets for use by UI Extensions and app backends.\n\nThe primary resource in Secret Store is a `secret`. Other apps can’t view secrets created by an app. Additionally, secrets are scoped to provide further permission control.\n\nAll Dashboard users and the app backend share `account` scoped secrets. Use the `account` scope for secrets that don’t change per-user, like a third-party API key.\n\nA `user` scoped secret is accessible by the app backend and one specific Dashboard user. Use the `user` scope for per-user secrets like per-user OAuth tokens, where different users might have different permissions.\n\nRelated guide: [Store data between page reloads](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/store-auth-data-custom-objects)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[GET/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/list)[POST/v1/apps/secrets/delete](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/delete)[GET/v1/apps/secrets/find](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/find)[POST/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/set)\n\n## [Reviews](https://docs.stripe.com/api/radar/reviews)\n\nReviews can be used to supplement automated fraud detection with human expertise.\n\nLearn more about [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar) and reviewing payments [here](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/reviews).\n\n## [Authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/update)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/list)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/approve](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/approve)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/decline](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/decline)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_create)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/capture](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_capture)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/expire](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_expire)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/finalize\\_amount](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_finalize_amount)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/increment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_increment)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/fraud\\_challenges/respond](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/respond_to_fraud_challenges)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/reverse](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_reverse)\n\n## [Cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/create)[POST/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/update)[GET/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/list)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/deliver](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_deliver)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/fail](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_fail)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/return](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_return)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/ship](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_ship)\n\n## [Physical Bundles](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/physical_bundles)\n\nA Physical Bundle represents the bundle of physical items -

For example, WisePOS E is a TerminalHardwareProduct and a WisePOS E - US and WisePOS E - UK are TerminalHardwareSKUs.\n\n## [Terminal Hardware SKU](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_skus)Preview feature\n\nA TerminalHardwareSKU represents a SKU for Terminal hardware. A SKU is a representation of a product available for purchase, containing information such as the name, price, and images.\n\n## [Transaction Entries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/transaction_entries)\n\nTransactionEntries represent individual units of money movements within a single [Transaction](#transactions).\n\n## [Scheduled Queries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/sigma/scheduled_queries)\n\nIf you have [scheduled a Sigma query](https://docs.stripe.com/sigma/scheduled-queries), you’ll receive a `sigma.scheduled_query_run.created` webhook each time the query runs. The webhook contains a `ScheduledQueryRun` object, which you can use to retrieve the query results.\n\n## [Report Types](https://docs.stripe.com/api/reporting/report_type)\n\nThe Report Type resource corresponds to a particular type of report, such as the “Activity summary” or “Itemized payouts” reports. These objects are identified by an ID belonging to a set of enumerated values. See [API Access to Reports documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/reporting/statements/api) for those Report Type IDs, along with required and optional parameters.\n\nNote that certain report types can only be run based on your live-mode data (not test-mode data), and will error when queried without a [live-mode API key](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#test-live-modes).\n\n## [Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/financial_connections/sessions)\n\nA Financial Connections Session is the secure way to programmatically launch the client-side Stripe.js modal that lets your users link their accounts.\n\n## [Verification Report](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_reports)\n\nA VerificationReport is the result of an attempt to collect and verify data from a user. The collection of verification checks performed is determined from the `type` and `options` parameters used. You can find the result of each verification check performed in the appropriate sub-resource: `document`, `id_number`, `selfie`.\n\nEach VerificationReport contains a copy of any data collected by the user as well as reference IDs which can be used to access collected images through the [FileUpload](https://docs.stripe.com/api/files) API. To configure and create VerificationReports, use the [VerificationSession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_sessions) API.\n\nRelated guide: [Accessing verification results](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verification-sessions#results).\n\n## [Crypto Onramp Quotes](https://docs.stripe.com/api/crypto/onramp_quotes)\n\nCrypto Onramp Quotes are estimated quotes for onramp conversions into all the different cryptocurrencies on different networks.

  "markdown": "# Customer Session | Stripe API Reference\n\nA Customer Session allows you to grant Stripe’s frontend SDKs (like Stripe.js) client-side access control over a Customer.\n\n## [The Customer Session object](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customer_sessions/object)\n\n### Attributes\n\n*   The client secret of this Customer Session. Used on the client to set up secure access to the given `customer`.\n    \n    The client secret can be used to provide access to `customer` from your frontend. It should not be stored, logged, or exposed to anyone other than the relevant customer. Make sure that you have TLS enabled on any page that includes the client secret.\n    \n*   This hash defines which component is enabled and the features it supports.\n    \n*   The Customer the Customer Session was created for.\n    \n*   The timestamp at which this Customer Session will expire.\n    \n\n### More attributes\n\nThe Customer Session object\n\n```\n{  \"object\": \"customer_session\",  \"client_secret\": \"_POpxYpmkXdtttYtZQYhrsOJZ2RCQ9kCqqXRU6qrP5c4Jgje\",  \"components\": {    \"buy_button\": {      \"enabled\": false    },    \"pricing_table\": {      \"enabled\": true    }  },  \"customer\": \"cus_PO34b57IOUb83c\",  \"expires_at\": 1684790027,  \"livemode\": false}\n```\n\n## [Create a Customer Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customer_sessions/create)\n\nCreates a Customer Session object that includes a single-use client secret that you can use on your front-end to grant client-side API access for certain customer resources.\n\n### Parameters\n\n*   Configuration for each component. Exactly 1 component must be enabled.\n    \n*   The ID of an existing customer for which to create the Customer Session.\n    \n\n### Returns\n\nReturns a Customer Session object.\n\nPOST /v1/customer\\_sessions\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/customer_sessions \\  -u \"sk_test_4eC39Hq...arjtT1zdp7dcsk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc:\" \\  -d customer=cus_PO34b57IOUb83c \\  -d \"components[pricing_table][enabled]\"=true\n```\n\n```\n{  \"object\": \"customer_session\",  \"client_secret\": \"_POpxYpmkXdtttYtZQYhrsOJZ2RCQ9kCqqXRU6qrP5c4Jgje\",  \"components\": {    \"buy_button\": {      \"enabled\": false    },    \"pricing_table\": {      \"enabled\": true    }  },  \"customer\": \"cus_PO34b57IOUb83c\",  \"expires_at\": 1684790027,  \"livemode\": false}\n```\n\n## [Disputes](https://docs.stripe.com/api/disputes)\n\nA dispute occurs when a customer questions your charge with their card issuer. When this happens, you have the opportunity to respond to the dispute with evidence that shows that the charge is legitimate.\n\nRelated guide: [Disputes and fraud](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes)\n\n## [Events](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events)\n\nEvents are our way of letting you know when something interesting happens in your account. When an interesting event occurs, we create a new `Event` object. For example, when a charge succeeds, we create a `charge.succeeded` event, and when an invoice payment attempt fails, we create an `invoice.payment_failed` event. Certain API requests might create multiple events. For example, if you create a new subscription for a customer, you receive both a `customer.subscription.created` event and a `charge.succeeded` event.\n\nEvents occur when the state of another API resource changes. The event’s data field embeds the resource’s state at the time of the change. For example, a `charge.succeeded` event contains a charge, and an `invoice.payment_failed` event contains an invoice.\n\nAs with other API resources, you can use endpoints to retrieve an [individual event](#retrieve_event) or a [list of events](#list_events) from the API. We also have a separate [webhooks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook) system for sending the `Event` objects directly to an endpoint on your server. You can manage webhooks in your [account settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/webhooks). Learn how to [listen for events](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks) so that your integration can automatically trigger reactions.\n\nWhen using [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect), you can also receive event notifications that occur in connected accounts. For these events, there’s an additional `account` attribute in the received `Event` object.\n\nWe only guarantee access to events through the [Retrieve Event API](#retrieve_event) for 30 days.\n\n## [Files](https://docs.stripe.com/api/files)\n\nThis object represents files hosted on Stripe’s servers. You can upload files with the [create file](#create_file) request (for example, when uploading dispute evidence). Stripe also creates files independently (for example, the results of a [Sigma scheduled query](#scheduled_queries)).\n\nRelated guide: [File upload guide](https://docs.stripe.com/file-upload)\n\n## [File Links](https://docs.stripe.com/api/file_links)\n\nTo share the contents of a `File` object with non-Stripe users, you can create a `FileLink`. `FileLink`s contain a URL that you can use to retrieve the contents of the file without authentication.\n\n## [Mandates](https://docs.stripe.com/api/mandates)\n\nA Mandate is a record of the permission that your customer gives you to debit their payment method.\n\n## [Setup Attempts](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_attempts)\n\nA SetupAttempt describes one attempted confirmation of a SetupIntent, whether that confirmation is successful or unsuccessful. You can use SetupAttempts to inspect details of a specific attempt at setting up a payment method using a SetupIntent.\n\n## [Confirmation Token](https://docs.stripe.com/api/confirmation_tokens)\n\nConfirmationTokens help transport client side data collected by Stripe JS over to your server for confirming a PaymentIntent or SetupIntent. If the confirmation is successful, values present on the ConfirmationToken are written onto the Intent.\n\nTo learn more about how to use ConfirmationToken, visit the related guides:\n\n*   [Finalize payments on the server](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/finalize-payments-on-the-server)\n*   [Build two-step confirmation](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/build-a-two-step-confirmation).\n\n## [Tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens)\n\nTokenization is the process Stripe uses to collect sensitive card or bank account details, or personally identifiable information (PII), directly from your customers in a secure manner. A token representing this information is returned to your server to use. Use our [recommended payments integrations](https://docs.stripe.com/payments) to perform this process on the client-side. This guarantees that no sensitive card data touches your server, and allows your integration to operate in a PCI-compliant way.\n\nIf you can’t use client-side tokenization, you can also create tokens using the API with either your publishable or secret API key. If your integration uses this method, you’re responsible for any PCI compliance that it might require, and you must keep your secret API key safe. Unlike with client-side tokenization, your customer’s information isn’t sent directly to Stripe, so we can’t determine how it’s handled or stored.\n\nYou can’t store or use tokens more than once. To store card or bank account information for later use, create [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api#customers) objects or [External accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/api#external_accounts). [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar), our integrated solution for automatic fraud protection, performs best with integrations that use client-side tokenization.\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_account)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_bank_account)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_card)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_cvc_update)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_person)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_pii)[GET/v1/tokens/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/retrieve)\n\n## [Cash Balance](https://docs.stripe.com/api/cash_balance)\n\nA customer’s `Cash balance` represents real funds. Customers can add funds to their cash balance by sending a bank transfer. These funds can be used for payment and can eventually be paid out to your bank account.\n\n## [Customer Portal Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customer_portal/sessions)\n\nThe Billing customer portal is a Stripe-hosted UI for subscription and billing management.\n\nA portal configuration describes the functionality and features that you want to provide to your customers through the portal.\n\nA portal session describes the instantiation of the customer portal for a particular customer. By visiting the session’s URL, the customer can manage their subscriptions and billing details. For security reasons, sessions are short-lived and will expire if the customer does not visit the URL. Create sessions on-demand when customers intend to manage their subscriptions and billing details.\n\nRelated guide: [Customer management](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management)\n\n## [Invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices)\n\nInvoices are statements of amounts owed by a customer, and are either generated one-off, or generated periodically from a subscription.\n\nThey contain [invoice items](#invoiceitems), and proration adjustments that may be caused by subscription upgrades/downgrades (if necessary).\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed through automatic charges, Stripe automatically finalizes your invoice and attempts payment. Note that finalizing the invoice, [when automatic](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/automatic-advancement-collection), does not happen immediately as the invoice is created. Stripe waits until one hour after the last webhook was successfully sent (or the last webhook timed out after failing). If you (and the platforms you may have connected to) have no webhooks configured, Stripe waits one hour after creation to finalize the invoice.\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed by sending an email, then based on your [email settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/billing/automatic), Stripe will email the invoice to your customer and await payment. These emails can contain a link to a hosted page to pay the invoice.\n\nStripe applies any customer credit on the account before determining the amount due for the invoice (i.e., the amount that will be actually charged). If the amount due for the invoice is less than Stripe’s [minimum allowed charge per currency](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts), the invoice is automatically marked paid, and we add the amount due to the customer’s credit balance which is applied to the next invoice.\n\nMore details on the customer’s credit balance are [here](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/customer/balance).\n\nRelated guide: [Send invoices to customers](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/invoices/sending)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create)[POST/v1/invoices/create\\_preview](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create_preview)[POST/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/lines/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_line)[GET/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/retrieve)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming)[GET/v1/invoices/:id/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming_invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/list)[DELETE/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/delete)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/add\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/add_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/remove\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/remove_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/update\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/finalize](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/finalize)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/mark\\_uncollectible](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/mark_uncollectible)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/pay](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/pay)[GET/v1/invoices/search](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/search)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/send](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/send)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/void](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/void)\n\n## [Meter Events](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event)\n\nA billing meter event represents a customer’s usage of a product. Meter events are used to bill a customer based on their usage. Meter events are associated with billing meters, which define the shape of the event’s payload and how those events are aggregated for billing.\n\n## [Meter Event Adjustment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_adjustment)\n\nA billing meter event adjustment is a resource that allows you to cancel a meter event. For example, you might create a billing meter event adjustment to cancel a meter event that was created in error or attached to the wrong customer.\n\n## [Meter Event Summary](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_summary)\n\nA billing meter event summary represents an aggregated view of a customer’s billing meter events within a specified timeframe. It indicates how much usage was accrued by a customer for that period.\n\n## [Plans](https://docs.stripe.com/api/plans)\n\nYou can now model subscriptions more flexibly using the [Prices API](#prices). It replaces the Plans API and is backwards compatible to simplify your migration.\n\nPlans define the base price, currency, and billing cycle for recurring purchases of products. [Products](#products) help you track inventory or provisioning, and plans help you track pricing. Different physical goods or levels of service should be represented by products, and pricing options should be represented by plans. This approach lets you change prices without having to change your provisioning scheme.\n\nFor example, you might have a single “gold” product that has plans for $10/month, $100/year, €9/month, and €90/year.\n\nRelated guides: [Set up a subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/set-up-subscription) and more about [products and prices](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/overview).\n\n## [Tax IDs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_create)[POST/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/create)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_retrieve)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/retrieve)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_list)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/list)[DELETE/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_delete)[DELETE/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/delete)\n\n## [Account Links](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_links)\n\nAccount Links are the means by which a Connect platform grants a connected account permission to access Stripe-hosted applications, such as Connect Onboarding.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect Onboarding](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom/hosted-onboarding)\n\n## [Account Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_sessions)\n\nAn AccountSession allows a Connect platform to grant access to a connected account in Connect embedded components.\n\nWe recommend that you create an AccountSession each time you need to display an embedded component to your user. Do not save AccountSessions to your database as they expire relatively quickly, and cannot be used more than once.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect embedded components](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-connect-embedded-components)\n\n## [Application Fees](https://docs.stripe.com/api/application_fees)\n\nWhen you collect a transaction fee on top of a charge made for your user (using [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)), an `Application Fee` object is created in your account. You can list, retrieve, and refund application fees.\n\nRelated guide: [Collecting application fees](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges#collect-fees)\n\n## [Country Specs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/country_specs)\n\nStripe needs to collect certain pieces of information about each account created. These requirements can differ depending on the account’s country. The Country Specs API makes these rules available to your integration.\n\nYou can also view the information from this API call as [an online guide](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information).\n\n## [Person](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/create)[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/update)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/retrieve)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/list)[DELETE/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/delete)\n\n## [Transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/transfers)\n\nA `Transfer` object is created when you move funds between Stripe accounts as part of Connect.\n\nBefore April 6, 2017, transfers also represented movement of funds from a Stripe account to a card or bank account. This behavior has since been split out into a [Payout](#payout_object) object, with corresponding payout endpoints. For more information, read about the [transfer/payout split](https://docs.stripe.com/transfer-payout-split).\n\nRelated guide: [Creating separate charges and transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n\n## [Secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/secret_management)\n\nSecret Store is an API that allows Stripe Apps developers to securely persist secrets for use by UI Extensions and app backends.\n\nThe primary resource in Secret Store is a `secret`.

If that doesn’t work, you can submit evidence to help us resolve the dispute in your favor. You can do this in your [dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/disputes), but if you prefer, you can use the API to submit evidence programmatically.\n\nDepending on your dispute type, different evidence fields will give you a better chance of winning your dispute. To figure out which evidence fields to provide, see our [guide to dispute types](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/categories).\n\n### Parameters\n\n*   Evidence to upload, to respond to a dispute. Updating any field in the hash will submit all fields in the hash for review. The combined character count of all fields is limited to 150,000.\n    \n*   Set of [key-value pairs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/metadata) that you can attach to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format. Individual keys can be unset by posting an empty value to them. All keys can be unset by posting an empty value to `metadata`.\n    \n*   Whether to immediately submit evidence to the bank. If `false`, evidence is staged on the dispute. Staged evidence is visible in the API and Dashboard, and can be submitted to the bank by making another request with this attribute set to `true` (the default).\n    \n\n### Returns\n\nReturns the dispute object.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/disputes/dp_1MtJUT2eZvKYlo2CNaw2HvEv \\  -u \"sk_test_4eC39Hq...arjtT1zdp7dcsk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc:\" \\  -d \"metadata[order_id]\"=6735\n```\n\n```\n{  \"id\": \"dp_1MtJUT2eZvKYlo2CNaw2HvEv\",  \"object\": \"dispute\",  \"amount\": 1000,  \"balance_transactions\": [],  \"charge\": \"ch_1AZtxr2eZvKYlo2CJDX8whov\",  \"created\": 1680651737,  \"currency\": \"usd\",  \"evidence\": {    \"access_activity_log\": null,    \"billing_address\": null,    \"cancellation_policy\": null,    \"cancellation_policy_disclosure\": null,    \"cancellation_rebuttal\": null,    \"customer_communication\": null,    \"customer_email_address\": null,    \"customer_name\": null,    \"customer_purchase_ip\": null,    \"customer_signature\": null,    \"duplicate_charge_documentation\": null,    \"duplicate_charge_explanation\": null,    \"duplicate_charge_id\": null,    \"product_description\": null,    \"receipt\": null,    \"refund_policy\": null,    \"refund_policy_disclosure\": null,    \"refund_refusal_explanation\": null,    \"service_date\": null,    \"service_documentation\": null,    \"shipping_address\": null,    \"shipping_carrier\": null,    \"shipping_date\": null,    \"shipping_documentation\": null,    \"shipping_tracking_number\": null,    \"uncategorized_file\": null,    \"uncategorized_text\": null  },  \"evidence_details\": {    \"due_by\": 1682294399,    \"has_evidence\": false,    \"past_due\": false,    \"submission_count\": 0  },  \"is_charge_refundable\": true,  \"livemode\": false,  \"metadata\": {    \"order_id\": \"6735\"  },  \"payment_intent\": null,  \"reason\": \"general\",  \"status\": \"warning_needs_response\"}\n```\n\n## [Retrieve a dispute](https://docs.stripe.com/api/disputes/retrieve)\n\nRetrieves the dispute with the given ID.\n\n### Parameters\n\nNo parameters.\n\n### Returns\n\nReturns a dispute if a valid dispute ID was provided.

All keys can be unset by posting an empty value to `metadata`.\n    \n*   #### \n    \n    off\\_sessionboolean | stringonly when confirm=true\n    \n    Set to `true` to indicate that the customer isn’t in your checkout flow during this payment attempt and can’t authenticate. Use this parameter in scenarios where you collect card details and [charge them later](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/cards/charging-saved-cards). This parameter can only be used with [`confirm=true`](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-confirm).\n    \n*   ID of the payment method (a PaymentMethod, Card, or [compatible Source](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/transitioning#compatibility) object) to attach to this PaymentIntent.\n    \n    If you omit this parameter with `confirm=true`, `customer.default_source` attaches as this PaymentIntent’s payment instrument to improve migration for users of the Charges API.

You can use SetupAttempts to inspect details of a specific attempt at setting up a payment method using a SetupIntent.\n\n## [Confirmation Token](https://docs.stripe.com/api/confirmation_tokens)\n\nConfirmationTokens help transport client side data collected by Stripe JS over to your server for confirming a PaymentIntent or SetupIntent. If the confirmation is successful, values present on the ConfirmationToken are written onto the Intent.\n\nTo learn more about how to use ConfirmationToken, visit the related guides:\n\n*   [Finalize payments on the server](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/finalize-payments-on-the-server)\n*   [Build two-step confirmation](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/build-a-two-step-confirmation).\n\n## [Tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens)\n\nTokenization is the process Stripe uses to collect sensitive card or bank account details, or personally identifiable information (PII), directly from your customers in a secure manner. A token representing this information is returned to your server to use. Use our [recommended payments integrations](https://docs.stripe.com/payments) to perform this process on the client-side. This guarantees that no sensitive card data touches your server, and allows your integration to operate in a PCI-compliant way.\n\nIf you can’t use client-side tokenization, you can also create tokens using the API with either your publishable or secret API key. If your integration uses this method, you’re responsible for any PCI compliance that it might require, and you must keep your secret API key safe. Unlike with client-side tokenization, your customer’s information isn’t sent directly to Stripe, so we can’t determine how it’s handled or stored.\n\nYou can’t store or use tokens more than once. To store card or bank account information for later use, create [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api#customers) objects or [External accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/api#external_accounts). [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar), our integrated solution for automatic fraud protection, performs best with integrations that use client-side tokenization.\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_account)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_bank_account)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_card)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_cvc_update)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_person)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_pii)[GET/v1/tokens/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/retrieve)\n\n## [Cash Balance](https://docs.stripe.com/api/cash_balance)\n\nA customer’s `Cash balance` represents real funds. Customers can add funds to their cash balance by sending a bank transfer. These funds can be used for payment and can eventually be paid out to your bank account.\n\n## [Customer Portal Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customer_portal/sessions)\n\nThe Billing customer portal is a Stripe-hosted UI for subscription and billing management.\n\nA portal configuration describes the functionality and features that you want to provide to your customers through the portal.\n\nA portal session describes the instantiation of the customer portal for a particular customer. By visiting the session’s URL, the customer can manage their subscriptions and billing details. For security reasons, sessions are short-lived and will expire if the customer does not visit the URL. Create sessions on-demand when customers intend to manage their subscriptions and billing details.\n\nRelated guide: [Customer management](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management)\n\n## [Invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices)\n\nInvoices are statements of amounts owed by a customer, and are either generated one-off, or generated periodically from a subscription.\n\nThey contain [invoice items](#invoiceitems), and proration adjustments that may be caused by subscription upgrades/downgrades (if necessary).\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed through automatic charges, Stripe automatically finalizes your invoice and attempts payment. Note that finalizing the invoice, [when automatic](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/automatic-advancement-collection), does not happen immediately as the invoice is created. Stripe waits until one hour after the last webhook was successfully sent (or the last webhook timed out after failing). If you (and the platforms you may have connected to) have no webhooks configured, Stripe waits one hour after creation to finalize the invoice.\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed by sending an email, then based on your [email settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/billing/automatic), Stripe will email the invoice to your customer and await payment. These emails can contain a link to a hosted page to pay the invoice.\n\nStripe applies any customer credit on the account before determining the amount due for the invoice (i.e., the amount that will be actually charged). If the amount due for the invoice is less than Stripe’s [minimum allowed charge per currency](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts), the invoice is automatically marked paid, and we add the amount due to the customer’s credit balance which is applied to the next invoice.\n\nMore details on the customer’s credit balance are [here](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/customer/balance).\n\nRelated guide: [Send invoices to customers](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/invoices/sending)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create)[POST/v1/invoices/create\\_preview](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create_preview)[POST/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/lines/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_line)[GET/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/retrieve)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming)[GET/v1/invoices/:id/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming_invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/list)[DELETE/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/delete)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/add\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/add_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/remove\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/remove_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/update\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/finalize](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/finalize)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/mark\\_uncollectible](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/mark_uncollectible)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/pay](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/pay)[GET/v1/invoices/search](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/search)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/send](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/send)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/void](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/void)\n\n## [Meter Events](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event)\n\nA billing meter event represents a customer’s usage of a product. Meter events are used to bill a customer based on their usage. Meter events are associated with billing meters, which define the shape of the event’s payload and how those events are aggregated for billing.\n\n## [Meter Event Adjustment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_adjustment)\n\nA billing meter event adjustment is a resource that allows you to cancel a meter event. For example, you might create a billing meter event adjustment to cancel a meter event that was created in error or attached to the wrong customer.\n\n## [Meter Event Summary](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_summary)\n\nA billing meter event summary represents an aggregated view of a customer’s billing meter events within a specified timeframe. It indicates how much usage was accrued by a customer for that period.\n\n## [Plans](https://docs.stripe.com/api/plans)\n\nYou can now model subscriptions more flexibly using the [Prices API](#prices). It replaces the Plans API and is backwards compatible to simplify your migration.\n\nPlans define the base price, currency, and billing cycle for recurring purchases of products. [Products](#products) help you track inventory or provisioning, and plans help you track pricing. Different physical goods or levels of service should be represented by products, and pricing options should be represented by plans. This approach lets you change prices without having to change your provisioning scheme.\n\nFor example, you might have a single “gold” product that has plans for $10/month, $100/year, €9/month, and €90/year.\n\nRelated guides: [Set up a subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/set-up-subscription) and more about [products and prices](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/overview).\n\n## [Tax IDs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_create)[POST/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/create)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_retrieve)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/retrieve)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_list)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/list)[DELETE/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_delete)[DELETE/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/delete)\n\n## [Account Links](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_links)\n\nAccount Links are the means by which a Connect platform grants a connected account permission to access Stripe-hosted applications, such as Connect Onboarding.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect Onboarding](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom/hosted-onboarding)\n\n## [Account Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_sessions)\n\nAn AccountSession allows a Connect platform to grant access to a connected account in Connect embedded components.\n\nWe recommend that you create an AccountSession each time you need to display an embedded component to your user. Do not save AccountSessions to your database as they expire relatively quickly, and cannot be used more than once.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect embedded components](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-connect-embedded-components)\n\n## [Application Fees](https://docs.stripe.com/api/application_fees)\n\nWhen you collect a transaction fee on top of a charge made for your user (using [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)), an `Application Fee` object is created in your account. You can list, retrieve, and refund application fees.\n\nRelated guide: [Collecting application fees](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges#collect-fees)\n\n## [Country Specs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/country_specs)\n\nStripe needs to collect certain pieces of information about each account created. These requirements can differ depending on the account’s country. The Country Specs API makes these rules available to your integration.\n\nYou can also view the information from this API call as [an online guide](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information).\n\n## [Person](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/create)[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/update)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/retrieve)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/list)[DELETE/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/delete)\n\n## [Transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/transfers)\n\nA `Transfer` object is created when you move funds between Stripe accounts as part of Connect.\n\nBefore April 6, 2017, transfers also represented movement of funds from a Stripe account to a card or bank account. This behavior has since been split out into a [Payout](#payout_object) object, with corresponding payout endpoints. For more information, read about the [transfer/payout split](https://docs.stripe.com/transfer-payout-split).\n\nRelated guide: [Creating separate charges and transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n\n## [Secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/secret_management)\n\nSecret Store is an API that allows Stripe Apps developers to securely persist secrets for use by UI Extensions and app backends.\n\nThe primary resource in Secret Store is a `secret`. Other apps can’t view secrets created by an app. Additionally, secrets are scoped to provide further permission control.\n\nAll Dashboard users and the app backend share `account` scoped secrets. Use the `account` scope for secrets that don’t change per-user, like a third-party API key.\n\nA `user` scoped secret is accessible by the app backend and one specific Dashboard user. Use the `user` scope for per-user secrets like per-user OAuth tokens, where different users might have different permissions.\n\nRelated guide: [Store data between page reloads](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/store-auth-data-custom-objects)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[GET/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/list)[POST/v1/apps/secrets/delete](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/delete)[GET/v1/apps/secrets/find](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/find)[POST/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/set)\n\n## [Reviews](https://docs.stripe.com/api/radar/reviews)\n\nReviews can be used to supplement automated fraud detection with human expertise.\n\nLearn more about [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar) and reviewing payments [here](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/reviews).\n\n## [Authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/update)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/list)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/approve](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/approve)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/decline](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/decline)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_create)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/capture](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_capture)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/expire](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_expire)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/finalize\\_amount](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_finalize_amount)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/increment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_increment)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/fraud\\_challenges/respond](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/respond_to_fraud_challenges)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/reverse](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_reverse)\n\n## [Cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/create)[POST/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/update)[GET/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/list)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/deliver](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_deliver)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/fail](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_fail)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/return](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_return)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/ship](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_ship)\n\n## [Physical Bundles](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/physical_bundles)\n\nA Physical Bundle represents the bundle of physical items - card stock, carrier letter, and envelope - that is shipped to a cardholder when you create a physical card.\n\n## [Reader](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/terminal/readers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/create)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/update)[GET/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/retrieve)[GET/v1/terminal/readers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/list)[DELETE/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/delete)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/cancel\\_action](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/cancel_action)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/collect\\_inputs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/collect_inputs)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/confirm\\_payment\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/confirm_payment_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/collect\\_payment\\_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/collect_payment_method)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/process\\_payment\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/process_payment_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/process\\_setup\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/process_setup_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/refund\\_payment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/refund_payment)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/set\\_reader\\_display](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/set_reader_display)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/terminal/readers/:id/present\\_payment\\_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/present_payment_method)\n\n## [Terminal Hardware Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_products)Preview feature\n\nA TerminalHardwareProduct is a category of hardware devices that are generally similar, but may have variations depending on the country it’s shipped to.\n\nTerminalHardwareSKUs represent variations within the same Product (for example, a country specific device). For example, WisePOS E is a TerminalHardwareProduct and a WisePOS E - US and WisePOS E - UK are TerminalHardwareSKUs.\n\n## [Terminal Hardware SKU](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_skus)Preview feature\n\nA TerminalHardwareSKU represents a SKU for Terminal hardware. A SKU is a representation of a product available for purchase, containing information such as the name, price, and images.\n\n## [Transaction Entries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/transaction_entries)\n\nTransactionEntries represent individual units of money movements within a single [Transaction](#transactions).\n\n## [Scheduled Queries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/sigma/scheduled_queries)\n\nIf you have [scheduled a Sigma query](https://docs.stripe.com/sigma/scheduled-queries), you’ll receive a `sigma.scheduled_query_run.created` webhook each time the query runs. The webhook contains a `ScheduledQueryRun` object, which you can use to retrieve the query results.\n\n## [Report Types](https://docs.stripe.com/api/reporting/report_type)\n\nThe Report Type resource corresponds to a particular type of report, such as the “Activity summary” or “Itemized payouts” reports. These objects are identified by an ID belonging to a set of enumerated values. See [API Access to Reports documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/reporting/statements/api) for those Report Type IDs, along with required and optional parameters.\n\nNote that certain report types can only be run based on your live-mode data (not test-mode data), and will error when queried without a [live-mode API key](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#test-live-modes).\n\n## [Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/financial_connections/sessions)\n\nA Financial Connections Session is the secure way to programmatically launch the client-side Stripe.js modal that lets your users link their accounts.\n\n## [Verification Report](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_reports)\n\nA VerificationReport is the result of an attempt to collect and verify data from a user. The collection of verification checks performed is determined from the `type` and `options` parameters used. You can find the result of each verification check performed in the appropriate sub-resource: `document`, `id_number`, `selfie`.\n\nEach VerificationReport contains a copy of any data collected by the user as well as reference IDs which can be used to access collected images through the [FileUpload](https://docs.stripe.com/api/files) API. To configure and create VerificationReports, use the [VerificationSession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_sessions) API.\n\nRelated guide: [Accessing verification results](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verification-sessions#results).\n\n## [Crypto Onramp Quotes](https://docs.stripe.com/api/crypto/onramp_quotes)\n\nCrypto Onramp Quotes are estimated quotes for onramp conversions into all the different cryptocurrencies on different networks. The Quotes API allows you to display quotes in your product UI before directing the user to the onramp widget.\n\nRelated guide: [Quotes API](https://docs.stripe.com/crypto/quotes-api)\n\n## [Climate Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/climate/product)\n\nA Climate product represents a type of carbon removal unit available for reservation. You can retrieve it to see the current price and availability.\n\n## [Forwarding Request](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/request)\n\nInstructs Stripe to make a request on your behalf using the destination URL. The destination URL is activated by Stripe at the time of onboarding. Stripe verifies requests with your credentials provided during onboarding, and injects card details from the payment\\_method into the request.\n\nStripe redacts all sensitive fields and headers, including authentication credentials and card numbers, before storing the request and response data in the forwarding Request object, which are subject to a 30-day retention period.\n\nYou can provide a Stripe idempotency key to make sure that requests with the same key result in only one outbound request. The Stripe idempotency key provided should be unique and different from any idempotency keys provided on the underlying third-party request.\n\nForwarding Requests are synchronous requests that return a response or time out according to Stripe’s limits.\n\nRelated guide: [Forward card details to third-party API endpoints](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/forwarding).\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/create)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/retrieve)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/list)",

Your [Stripe balance](#balance) must cover the payout amount. If it doesn’t, you receive an “Insufficient Funds” error.\n\nIf your API key is in test mode, money won’t actually be sent, though every other action occurs as if you’re in live mode.\n\nIf you create a manual payout on a Stripe account that uses multiple payment source types, you need to specify the source type balance that the payout draws from.

Often useful for displaying to users.\n    \n*   Set of [key-value pairs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/metadata) that you can attach to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format. Individual keys can be unset by posting an empty value to them. All keys can be unset by posting an empty value to `metadata`.\n    \n*   #### \n    \n    statement\\_descriptorstring\n    \n    A string that displays on the recipient’s bank or card statement (up to 22 characters). A `statement_descriptor` that’s longer than 22 characters return an error. Most banks truncate this information and display it inconsistently. Some banks might not display it at all.\n    \n\n### More parameters\n\n### Returns\n\nReturns a payout object if no initial errors are present during the payout creation (invalid routing number, insufficient funds, and so on).

If the confirmation is successful, values present on the ConfirmationToken are written onto the Intent.\n\nTo learn more about how to use ConfirmationToken, visit the related guides:\n\n*   [Finalize payments on the server](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/finalize-payments-on-the-server)\n*   [Build two-step confirmation](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/build-a-two-step-confirmation).\n\n## [Tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens)\n\nTokenization is the process Stripe uses to collect sensitive card or bank account details, or personally identifiable information (PII), directly from your customers in a secure manner. A token representing this information is returned to your server to use. Use our [recommended payments integrations](https://docs.stripe.com/payments) to perform this process on the client-side. This guarantees that no sensitive card data touches your server, and allows your integration to operate in a PCI-compliant way.\n\nIf you can’t use client-side tokenization, you can also create tokens using the API with either your publishable or secret API key. If your integration uses this method, you’re responsible for any PCI compliance that it might require, and you must keep your secret API key safe. Unlike with client-side tokenization, your customer’s information isn’t sent directly to Stripe, so we can’t determine how it’s handled or stored.\n\nYou can’t store or use tokens more than once. To store card or bank account information for later use, create [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api#customers) objects or [External accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/api#external_accounts). [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar), our integrated solution for automatic fraud protection, performs best with integrations that use client-side tokenization.\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_account)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_bank_account)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_card)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_cvc_update)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_person)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_pii)[GET/v1/tokens/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/retrieve)\n\n## [Cash Balance](https://docs.stripe.com/api/cash_balance)\n\nA customer’s `Cash balance` represents real funds. Customers can add funds to their cash balance by sending a bank transfer. These funds can be used for payment and can eventually be paid out to your bank account.\n\n## [Customer Portal Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customer_portal/sessions)\n\nThe Billing customer portal is a Stripe-hosted UI for subscription and billing management.\n\nA portal configuration describes the functionality and features that you want to provide to your customers through the portal.\n\nA portal session describes the instantiation of the customer portal for a particular customer. By visiting the session’s URL, the customer can manage their subscriptions and billing details. For security reasons, sessions are short-lived and will expire if the customer does not visit the URL. Create sessions on-demand when customers intend to manage their subscriptions and billing details.\n\nRelated guide: [Customer management](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management)\n\n## [Invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices)\n\nInvoices are statements of amounts owed by a customer, and are either generated one-off, or generated periodically from a subscription.\n\nThey contain [invoice items](#invoiceitems), and proration adjustments that may be caused by subscription upgrades/downgrades (if necessary).\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed through automatic charges, Stripe automatically finalizes your invoice and attempts payment. Note that finalizing the invoice, [when automatic](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/automatic-advancement-collection), does not happen immediately as the invoice is created. Stripe waits until one hour after the last webhook was successfully sent (or the last webhook timed out after failing). If you (and the platforms you may have connected to) have no webhooks configured, Stripe waits one hour after creation to finalize the invoice.\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed by sending an email, then based on your [email settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/billing/automatic), Stripe will email the invoice to your customer and await payment. These emails can contain a link to a hosted page to pay the invoice.\n\nStripe applies any customer credit on the account before determining the amount due for the invoice (i.e., the amount that will be actually charged). If the amount due for the invoice is less than Stripe’s [minimum allowed charge per currency](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts), the invoice is automatically marked paid, and we add the amount due to the customer’s credit balance which is applied to the next invoice.\n\nMore details on the customer’s credit balance are [here](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/customer/balance).\n\nRelated guide: [Send invoices to customers](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/invoices/sending)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create)[POST/v1/invoices/create\\_preview](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create_preview)[POST/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/lines/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_line)[GET/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/retrieve)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming)[GET/v1/invoices/:id/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming_invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/list)[DELETE/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/delete)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/add\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/add_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/remove\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/remove_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/update\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/finalize](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/finalize)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/mark\\_uncollectible](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/mark_uncollectible)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/pay](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/pay)[GET/v1/invoices/search](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/search)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/send](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/send)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/void](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/void)\n\n## [Meter Events](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event)\n\nA billing meter event represents a customer’s usage of a product. Meter events are used to bill a customer based on their usage. Meter events are associated with billing meters, which define the shape of the event’s payload and how those events are aggregated for billing.\n\n## [Meter Event Adjustment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_adjustment)\n\nA billing meter event adjustment is a resource that allows you to cancel a meter event. For example, you might create a billing meter event adjustment to cancel a meter event that was created in error or attached to the wrong customer.\n\n## [Meter Event Summary](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_summary)\n\nA billing meter event summary represents an aggregated view of a customer’s billing meter events within a specified timeframe. It indicates how much usage was accrued by a customer for that period.\n\n## [Plans](https://docs.stripe.com/api/plans)\n\nYou can now model subscriptions more flexibly using the [Prices API](#prices). It replaces the Plans API and is backwards compatible to simplify your migration.\n\nPlans define the base price, currency, and billing cycle for recurring purchases of products. [Products](#products) help you track inventory or provisioning, and plans help you track pricing. Different physical goods or levels of service should be represented by products, and pricing options should be represented by plans. This approach lets you change prices without having to change your provisioning scheme.\n\nFor example, you might have a single “gold” product that has plans for $10/month, $100/year, €9/month, and €90/year.\n\nRelated guides: [Set up a subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/set-up-subscription) and more about [products and prices](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/overview).\n\n## [Tax IDs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_create)[POST/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/create)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_retrieve)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/retrieve)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_list)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/list)[DELETE/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_delete)[DELETE/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/delete)\n\n## [Account Links](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_links)\n\nAccount Links are the means by which a Connect platform grants a connected account permission to access Stripe-hosted applications, such as Connect Onboarding.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect Onboarding](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom/hosted-onboarding)\n\n## [Account Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_sessions)\n\nAn AccountSession allows a Connect platform to grant access to a connected account in Connect embedded components.\n\nWe recommend that you create an AccountSession each time you need to display an embedded component to your user. Do not save AccountSessions to your database as they expire relatively quickly, and cannot be used more than once.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect embedded components](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-connect-embedded-components)\n\n## [Application Fees](https://docs.stripe.com/api/application_fees)\n\nWhen you collect a transaction fee on top of a charge made for your user (using [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)), an `Application Fee` object is created in your account. You can list, retrieve, and refund application fees.\n\nRelated guide: [Collecting application fees](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges#collect-fees)\n\n## [Country Specs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/country_specs)\n\nStripe needs to collect certain pieces of information about each account created. These requirements can differ depending on the account’s country. The Country Specs API makes these rules available to your integration.\n\nYou can also view the information from this API call as [an online guide](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information).\n\n## [Person](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/create)[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/update)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/retrieve)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/list)[DELETE/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/delete)\n\n## [Transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/transfers)\n\nA `Transfer` object is created when you move funds between Stripe accounts as part of Connect.\n\nBefore April 6, 2017, transfers also represented movement of funds from a Stripe account to a card or bank account. This behavior has since been split out into a [Payout](#payout_object) object, with corresponding payout endpoints. For more information, read about the [transfer/payout split](https://docs.stripe.com/transfer-payout-split).\n\nRelated guide: [Creating separate charges and transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n\n## [Secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/secret_management)\n\nSecret Store is an API that allows Stripe Apps developers to securely persist secrets for use by UI Extensions and app backends.\n\nThe primary resource in Secret Store is a `secret`. Other apps can’t view secrets created by an app. Additionally, secrets are scoped to provide further permission control.\n\nAll Dashboard users and the app backend share `account` scoped secrets. Use the `account` scope for secrets that don’t change per-user, like a third-party API key.\n\nA `user` scoped secret is accessible by the app backend and one specific Dashboard user. Use the `user` scope for per-user secrets like per-user OAuth tokens, where different users might have different permissions.\n\nRelated guide: [Store data between page reloads](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/store-auth-data-custom-objects)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[GET/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/list)[POST/v1/apps/secrets/delete](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/delete)[GET/v1/apps/secrets/find](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/find)[POST/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/set)\n\n## [Reviews](https://docs.stripe.com/api/radar/reviews)\n\nReviews can be used to supplement automated fraud detection with human expertise.\n\nLearn more about [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar) and reviewing payments [here](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/reviews).\n\n## [Authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/update)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/list)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/approve](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/approve)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/decline](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/decline)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_create)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/capture](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_capture)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/expire](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_expire)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/finalize\\_amount](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_finalize_amount)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/increment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_increment)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/fraud\\_challenges/respond](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/respond_to_fraud_challenges)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/reverse](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_reverse)\n\n## [Cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/create)[POST/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/update)[GET/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/list)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/deliver](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_deliver)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/fail](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_fail)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/return](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_return)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/ship](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_ship)\n\n## [Physical Bundles](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/physical_bundles)\n\nA Physical Bundle represents the bundle of physical items - card stock, carrier letter, and envelope - that is shipped to a cardholder when you create a physical card.\n\n## [Reader](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/terminal/readers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/create)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/update)[GET/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/retrieve)[GET/v1/terminal/readers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/list)[DELETE/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/delete)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/cancel\\_action](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/cancel_action)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/collect\\_inputs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/collect_inputs)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/confirm\\_payment\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/confirm_payment_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/collect\\_payment\\_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/collect_payment_method)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/process\\_payment\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/process_payment_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/process\\_setup\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/process_setup_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/refund\\_payment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/refund_payment)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/set\\_reader\\_display](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/set_reader_display)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/terminal/readers/:id/present\\_payment\\_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/present_payment_method)\n\n## [Terminal Hardware Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_products)Preview feature\n\nA TerminalHardwareProduct is a category of hardware devices that are generally similar, but may have variations depending on the country it’s shipped to.\n\nTerminalHardwareSKUs represent variations within the same Product (for example, a country specific device). For example, WisePOS E is a TerminalHardwareProduct and a WisePOS E - US and WisePOS E - UK are TerminalHardwareSKUs.\n\n## [Terminal Hardware SKU](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_skus)Preview feature\n\nA TerminalHardwareSKU represents a SKU for Terminal hardware. A SKU is a representation of a product available for purchase, containing information such as the name, price, and images.\n\n## [Transaction Entries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/transaction_entries)\n\nTransactionEntries represent individual units of money movements within a single [Transaction](#transactions).\n\n## [Scheduled Queries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/sigma/scheduled_queries)\n\nIf you have [scheduled a Sigma query](https://docs.stripe.com/sigma/scheduled-queries), you’ll receive a `sigma.scheduled_query_run.created` webhook each time the query runs. The webhook contains a `ScheduledQueryRun` object, which you can use to retrieve the query results.\n\n## [Report Types](https://docs.stripe.com/api/reporting/report_type)\n\nThe Report Type resource corresponds to a particular type of report, such as the “Activity summary” or “Itemized payouts” reports. These objects are identified by an ID belonging to a set of enumerated values. See [API Access to Reports documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/reporting/statements/api) for those Report Type IDs, along with required and optional parameters.\n\nNote that certain report types can only be run based on your live-mode data (not test-mode data), and will error when queried without a [live-mode API key](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#test-live-modes).\n\n## [Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/financial_connections/sessions)\n\nA Financial Connections Session is the secure way to programmatically launch the client-side Stripe.js modal that lets your users link their accounts.\n\n## [Verification Report](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_reports)\n\nA VerificationReport is the result of an attempt to collect and verify data from a user. The collection of verification checks performed is determined from the `type` and `options` parameters used. You can find the result of each verification check performed in the appropriate sub-resource: `document`, `id_number`, `selfie`.\n\nEach VerificationReport contains a copy of any data collected by the user as well as reference IDs which can be used to access collected images through the [FileUpload](https://docs.stripe.com/api/files) API. To configure and create VerificationReports, use the [VerificationSession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_sessions) API.\n\nRelated guide: [Accessing verification results](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verification-sessions#results).\n\n## [Crypto Onramp Quotes](https://docs.stripe.com/api/crypto/onramp_quotes)\n\nCrypto Onramp Quotes are estimated quotes for onramp conversions into all the different cryptocurrencies on different networks. The Quotes API allows you to display quotes in your product UI before directing the user to the onramp widget.\n\nRelated guide: [Quotes API](https://docs.stripe.com/crypto/quotes-api)\n\n## [Climate Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/climate/product)\n\nA Climate product represents a type of carbon removal unit available for reservation. You can retrieve it to see the current price and availability.\n\n## [Forwarding Request](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/request)\n\nInstructs Stripe to make a request on your behalf using the destination URL. The destination URL is activated by Stripe at the time of onboarding. Stripe verifies requests with your credentials provided during onboarding, and injects card details from the payment\\_method into the request.\n\nStripe redacts all sensitive fields and headers, including authentication credentials and card numbers, before storing the request and response data in the forwarding Request object, which are subject to a 30-day retention period.\n\nYou can provide a Stripe idempotency key to make sure that requests with the same key result in only one outbound request. The Stripe idempotency key provided should be unique and different from any idempotency keys provided on the underlying third-party request.\n\nForwarding Requests are synchronous requests that return a response or time out according to Stripe’s limits.\n\nRelated guide: [Forward card details to third-party API endpoints](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/forwarding).\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/create)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/retrieve)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/list)",

Funds will be refunded to the credit or debit card that was originally charged.\n\nYou can optionally refund only part of a charge. You can do so multiple times, until the entire charge has been refunded.\n\nOnce entirely refunded, a charge can’t be refunded again. This method will raise an error when called on an already-refunded charge, or when trying to refund more money than is left on a charge.\n\n### Parameters\n\n*   A positive integer in the [smallest currency unit](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#zero-decimal) representing how much of this charge to refund. Can refund only up to the remaining, unrefunded amount of the charge.\n    \n*   The identifier of the charge to refund.\n    \n*   Set of [key-value pairs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/metadata) that you can attach to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format. Individual keys can be unset by posting an empty value to them. All keys can be unset by posting an empty value to `metadata`.\n    \n*   The identifier of the PaymentIntent to refund.\n    \n*   String indicating the reason for the refund. If set, possible values are `duplicate`, `fraudulent`, and `requested_by_customer`. If you believe the charge to be fraudulent, specifying `fraudulent` as the reason will add the associated card and email to your [block lists](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/lists), and will also help us improve our fraud detection algorithms.\n    \n\n### More parameters\n\n*   #### \n    \n    refund\\_application\\_feebooleanConnect only\n    \n*   #### \n    \n    reverse\\_transferbooleanConnect only\n    \n\n### Returns\n\nReturns the `Refund` object if the refund succeeded.

Any parameters that you don’t provide remain unchanged.\n\nThis request only accepts `metadata` as an argument.\n\n### Parameters\n\n*   Set of [key-value pairs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/metadata) that you can attach to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format. Individual keys can be unset by posting an empty value to them.

identifiable information (PII), directly from your customers in a secure manner. A token representing this information is returned to your server to use. Use our [recommended payments integrations](https://docs.stripe.com/payments) to perform this process on the client-side. This guarantees that no sensitive card data touches your server, and allows your integration to operate in a PCI-compliant way.\n\nIf you can’t use client-side tokenization, you can also create tokens using the API with either your publishable or secret API key. If your integration uses this method, you’re responsible for any PCI compliance that it might require, and you must keep your secret API key safe. Unlike with client-side tokenization, your customer’s information isn’t sent directly to Stripe, so we can’t determine how it’s handled or stored.\n\nYou can’t store or use tokens more than once. To store card or bank account information for later use, create [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api#customers) objects or [External accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/api#external_accounts). [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar), our integrated solution for automatic fraud protection, performs best with integrations that use client-side tokenization.\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_account)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_bank_account)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_card)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_cvc_update)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_person)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_pii)[GET/v1/tokens/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/retrieve)\n\n## [Cash Balance](https://docs.stripe.com/api/cash_balance)\n\nA customer’s `Cash balance` represents real funds. Customers can add funds to their cash balance by sending a bank transfer. These funds can be used for payment and can eventually be paid out to your bank account.\n\n## [Customer Portal Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customer_portal/sessions)\n\nThe Billing customer portal is a Stripe-hosted UI for subscription and billing management.\n\nA portal configuration describes the functionality and features that you want to provide to your customers through the portal.\n\nA portal session describes the instantiation of the customer portal for a particular customer. By visiting the session’s URL, the customer can manage their subscriptions and billing details. For security reasons, sessions are short-lived and will expire if the customer does not visit the URL. Create sessions on-demand when customers intend to manage their subscriptions and billing details.\n\nRelated guide: [Customer management](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management)\n\n## [Invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices)\n\nInvoices are statements of amounts owed by a customer, and are either generated one-off, or generated periodically from a subscription.\n\nThey contain [invoice items](#invoiceitems), and proration adjustments that may be caused by subscription upgrades/downgrades (if necessary).\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed through automatic charges, Stripe automatically finalizes your invoice and attempts payment. Note that finalizing the invoice, [when automatic](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/automatic-advancement-collection), does not happen immediately as the invoice is created. Stripe waits until one hour after the last webhook was successfully sent (or the last webhook timed out after failing). If you (and the platforms you may have connected to) have no webhooks configured, Stripe waits one hour after creation to finalize the invoice.\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed by sending an email, then based on your [email settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/billing/automatic), Stripe will email the invoice to your customer and await payment. These emails can contain a link to a hosted page to pay the invoice.\n\nStripe applies any customer credit on the account before determining the amount due for the invoice (i.e., the amount that will be actually charged). If the amount due for the invoice is less than Stripe’s [minimum allowed charge per currency](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts), the invoice is automatically marked paid, and we add the amount due to the customer’s credit balance which is applied to the next invoice.\n\nMore details on the customer’s credit balance are [here](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/customer/balance).\n\nRelated guide: [Send invoices to customers](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/invoices/sending)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create)[POST/v1/invoices/create\\_preview](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create_preview)[POST/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/lines/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_line)[GET/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/retrieve)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming)[GET/v1/invoices/:id/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming_invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/list)[DELETE/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/delete)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/add\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/add_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/remove\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/remove_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/update\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/finalize](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/finalize)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/mark\\_uncollectible](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/mark_uncollectible)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/pay](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/pay)[GET/v1/invoices/search](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/search)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/send](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/send)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/void](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/void)\n\n## [Meter Events](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event)\n\nA billing meter event represents a customer’s usage of a product. Meter events are used to bill a customer based on their usage. Meter events are associated with billing meters, which define the shape of the event’s payload and how those events are aggregated for billing.\n\n## [Meter Event Adjustment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_adjustment)\n\nA billing meter event adjustment is a resource that allows you to cancel a meter event. For example, you might create a billing meter event adjustment to cancel a meter event that was created in error or attached to the wrong customer.\n\n## [Meter Event Summary](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_summary)\n\nA billing meter event summary represents an aggregated view of a customer’s billing meter events within a specified timeframe. It indicates how much usage was accrued by a customer for that period.\n\n## [Plans](https://docs.stripe.com/api/plans)\n\nYou can now model subscriptions more flexibly using the [Prices API](#prices). It replaces the Plans API and is backwards compatible to simplify your migration.\n\nPlans define the base price, currency, and billing cycle for recurring purchases of products. [Products](#products) help you track inventory or provisioning, and plans help you track pricing. Different physical goods or levels of service should be represented by products, and pricing options should be represented by plans. This approach lets you change prices without having to change your provisioning scheme.\n\nFor example, you might have a single “gold” product that has plans for $10/month, $100/year, €9/month, and €90/year.\n\nRelated guides: [Set up a subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/set-up-subscription) and more about [products and prices](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/overview).\n\n## [Tax IDs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_create)[POST/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/create)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_retrieve)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/retrieve)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_list)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/list)[DELETE/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_delete)[DELETE/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/delete)\n\n## [Account Links](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_links)\n\nAccount Links are the means by which a Connect platform grants a connected account permission to access Stripe-hosted applications, such as Connect Onboarding.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect Onboarding](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom/hosted-onboarding)\n\n## [Account Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_sessions)\n\nAn AccountSession allows a Connect platform to grant access to a connected account in Connect embedded components.\n\nWe recommend that you create an AccountSession each time you need to display an embedded component to your user. Do not save AccountSessions to your database as they expire relatively quickly, and cannot be used more than once.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect embedded components](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-connect-embedded-components)\n\n## [Application Fees](https://docs.stripe.com/api/application_fees)\n\nWhen you collect a transaction fee on top of a charge made for your user (using [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)), an `Application Fee` object is created in your account. You can list, retrieve, and refund application fees.\n\nRelated guide: [Collecting application fees](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges#collect-fees)\n\n## [Country Specs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/country_specs)\n\nStripe needs to collect certain pieces of information about each account created. These requirements can differ depending on the account’s country. The Country Specs API makes these rules available to your integration.\n\nYou can also view the information from this API call as [an online guide](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information).\n\n## [Person](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/create)[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/update)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/retrieve)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/list)[DELETE/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/delete)\n\n## [Transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/transfers)\n\nA `Transfer` object is created when you move funds between Stripe accounts as part of Connect.\n\nBefore April 6, 2017, transfers also represented movement of funds from a Stripe account to a card or bank account. This behavior has since been split out into a [Payout](#payout_object) object, with corresponding payout endpoints. For more information, read about the [transfer/payout split](https://docs.stripe.com/transfer-payout-split).\n\nRelated guide: [Creating separate charges and transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n\n## [Secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/secret_management)\n\nSecret Store is an API that allows Stripe Apps developers to securely persist secrets for use by UI Extensions and app backends.\n\nThe primary resource in Secret Store is a `secret`. Other apps can’t view secrets created by an app. Additionally, secrets are scoped to provide further permission control.\n\nAll Dashboard users and the app backend share `account` scoped secrets. Use the `account` scope for secrets that don’t change per-user, like a third-party API key.\n\nA `user` scoped secret is accessible by the app backend and one specific Dashboard user.

  "markdown": "# How PaymentIntents work | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Learn how PaymentIntents work within the payment flow.\n\nPayments involving [asynchronous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_system \"asynchronous\") processes can be complex to manage. For example, a user might be required to confirm a payment using [3D Secure](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure \"3D Secure (3DS)\"). Asynchronous payment flows are hard to manage because they depend on customer interactions that happen outside of your application. [PaymentIntents](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents) and [SetupIntents](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_intents) simplify management by tracking the status of the flow in a _state machine_.\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/1ab45e9a3dd360cdbbe998626aaa5ca1.svg)\n\nrequires\\_payment\\_method\n\nWhen the PaymentIntent is created, it has a status of `requires_payment_method`1 [until a payment method is attached](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/overview).\n\nWe recommend creating the PaymentIntent as soon as you know how much you want to charge, so that Stripe can record all the attempted payments.\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/requires-payment-method.21aed536306bea4c2247fff2ea66f08d.svg)\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/d93e2a08ffc6bbfe4683e3f7d0fffe32.svg)\n\nrequires\\_confirmation\n\nOptional\n\nAfter the customer provides their payment information, the PaymentIntent is ready to be confirmed.\n\nIn most integrations, this state is skipped because payment method information is submitted at the same time that the payment is confirmed.\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/requires-confirmation.a6c272d9b055a3478607d8775f1fc50d.svg)\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/94646c1d7332e58bd1d56e6cebd1a40e.svg)\n\nrequires\\_action\n\nIf the payment requires additional actions, such as authenticating with [3D Secure](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure), the PaymentIntent has a status of `requires_action`1.\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/requires-action.a062dfa0d428b32132566ba7ef1d7243.svg)\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/8ccc7708adc370d6365aa5558ee39a62.svg)\n\nprocessing\n\nAfter required actions are handled, the PaymentIntent moves to `processing` for asynchronous payment methods, such as bank debits. These types of payment methods can take up to a few days to process. Other payment methods, such as cards, are processed more quickly and don’t go into the `processing` status.\n\nIf you’re separately [authorizing and capturing funds](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/place-a-hold-on-a-payment-method), your PaymentIntent can instead move to `requires_capture`. In that case, attempting to capture the funds moves it to `processing`.\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/processing.c663be2135026c121cbc874940a75208.svg)\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/6423ea22ac10bfa6996c6f9db9b0ad1d.svg)\n\nsucceeded\n\nA PaymentIntent with a status of succeeded means that the payment flow it is driving is complete.\n\nThe funds are now in your account and you can confidently fulfill the order. If you need to refund the customer, you can use the Refunds API.\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/succeeded.949bd1ab653cc1b01743b30d117d92eb.svg)\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/34cbc85e7b2159474edf46422b7762f7.svg)\n\nrequires\\_payment\\_method\n\nIf the payment attempt fails (for example due to a decline), the PaymentIntent’s status returns to `requires_payment_method` so that the payment can be retried.\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/failed.6db418ae7d0080b133e55d193f6d4bac.svg)\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/3eb46c024752a66b38516e0f282b95af.svg)\n\ncanceled\n\nYou can cancel a PaymentIntent at any point before it’s in a `processing`2 or `succeeded` state. Canceling it invalidates the PaymentIntent for future payment attempts, and can’t be undone. If any funds have been held, cancellation releases them.\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/canceled.2f4b54d22ada83182bc807459c912d64.svg)",

It provides many features, such as Apple Pay, Google Pay, internationalization, and form validation.\n\nThe [Charges](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges) and [Payment Intents](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents) APIs let you build custom payment flows and experiences.\n\nThe Payment Intents API is the unifying API for all Stripe products and payment methods. While we are not deprecating Charges, new features are only available with the Payment Intents API.\n\nFor a full feature comparison, see the table below:\n\n| Charges API | Payment Intents API |\n| --- | --- |\n| Used by businesses with customers primarily in the US / Canada who want a simple way to accept cards. | Required for businesses that accept multiple payment methods and cards requiring authentication (for example, due to [Strong Customer Authentication](https://docs.stripe.com/strong-customer-authentication \"Strong Customer Authentication\") in Europe). |\n| Works on Web, iOS, and Android. | Works on Web, iOS, and Android.

To help with this, the charge object has two additional properties, [payment\\_method\\_details](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/object#charge_object-payment_method_details) and [billing\\_details](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/object#charge_object-billing_details), which provide a consistent interface for reading the details of the payment method used for the charge.\n\nThese fields are available on all API versions and on charge objects created with both the Charges API and the Payment Intents API.\n\nThe following table shows commonly used properties on a charge and how the same information can be accessed using the additional properties:\n\n| Description | Before | After |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Details about the payment method used to create a charge | `charge.source` | `charge.payment_method_details` |\n| ID of the payment method used for the charge | `charge.source.id` | `charge.payment_method` |\n| Type of payment method used | `charge.source.object` (for example, `card` or `bank_account`) | `charge.payment_method_details.type` |\n| Billing information for the charge (for example, billing postal code) | `charge.source.address_zip` | `charge.billing_details.address.postal_code` |\n| Name of the cardholder | `charge.source.name` | `charge.billing_details.name` |\n| Last 4 digits of the card used | `charge.source.last4` | `charge.payment_method_details.card.last4` |\n| Fingerprint of the card | `charge.source.fingerprint` | `charge.payment_method_details.card.fingerprint` |\n| CVC verification status for the charge | `charge.source.cvc_check` | `charge.payment_method_details.card.checks.cvc_check` |\n| Card brand values | `charge.source.brand` can be one of: `American Express`, `Diners Club`, `Discover`, `JCB`, `MasterCard`, `UnionPay`, `Visa` | `charge.payment_method_details.card.brand` can be one of: `amex`, `diners`, `discover`, `jcb`, `mastercard`, `unionpay`, `visa` |\n| Google Pay enum value | `charge.source.tokenization_method` is `android_pay` | `card.wallet.type` within `charge.payment_method_details` is `google_pay` |",

Your integration can inspect the PaymentIntent to determine the status of the payment process, so that you can take business actions or respond to states that require further intervention.\n\nYou can also use the Stripe Dashboard to configure your account to email you about payment status, such as successful payments. Change your [email notifications](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/teams#email-notifications) in your [user settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/user).\n\n## Check PaymentIntent status on the client ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nWhen completing a payment on the client with the [confirmCardPayment](https://docs.stripe.com/js#stripe-confirm-card-payment) function, you can inspect the returned PaymentIntent to determine its current status:\n\n`(async () => {   const {paymentIntent, error} = await stripe.confirmCardPayment(clientSecret);   if (error) {     // Handle error here   } else if (paymentIntent && paymentIntent.status === 'succeeded') {     // Handle successful payment here   } })();`\n\nThe following are the possible outcomes of using the `confirmCardPayment` function:\n\n| **Event** | **What Happened** | **Expected Integration** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Resolves with a PaymentIntent | The customer completed payment on your checkout page | Inform the customer that their payment succeeded |\n| Resolves with an error | The customer’s payment failed on your checkout page | Display an error message and prompt your customer to attempt payment again |\n\nThe promise returned by `confirmCardPayment` resolves when the payment process has either completed or failed with an error. When it completes successfully and returns a PaymentIntent, the status is always `succeeded` (or `requires_capture` if [capturing later](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/place-a-hold-on-a-payment-method)). When the payment requires an additional step such as authentication, the promise doesn’t resolve until that step is either complete or has timed out.\n\n## Check PaymentIntent status on the client without using confirmCardPayment ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nTo check the status of a PaymentIntent without using the `confirmCardPayment` function, retrieve it independently by using the [`retrievePaymentIntent`](https://docs.stripe.com/js/payment_intents/retrieve_payment_intent) function and passing in the [client secret](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-client_secret \"PaymentIntent client secret\").\n\nThe following are some [possible statuses](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-status) of the PaymentIntent following a confirmation:\n\n| **What Happened** | **Expected PaymentIntent Status** |\n| --- | --- |\n| The customer completed payment on your checkout page | `succeeded` |\n| The customer didn’t complete the checkout | `requires_action` |\n| The customer’s payment failed on your checkout page | `requires_payment_method` |\n\n[Read more about the PaymentIntent statuses](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/paymentintents/lifecycle).\n\n`(async () => {   const {paymentIntent} = await stripe.retrievePaymentIntent(clientSecret);   if (paymentIntent && paymentIntent.status === 'succeeded') {     // Handle successful payment here   } else {     // Handle unsuccessful, processing, or canceled payments and API errors here   } })();`\n\n## Monitor a PaymentIntent with webhooks ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nStripe can send [webhook](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks \"webhook\") events to your server to notify you when the status of a PaymentIntent changes, which you can use for purposes such as determining when to fulfill goods and services.\n\nDon’t attempt to handle order fulfillment on the client side because customers can leave the page after payment is complete but before the fulfillment process initiates. Instead, use webhooks to monitor the `payment_intent.succeeded` event and handle its completion asynchronously instead of attempting to initiate fulfillment on the client side.\n\n#### Caution\n\nIt’s technically possible to use polling instead of webhooks to monitor for changes caused by asynchronous operations—repeatedly retrieving a PaymentIntent so that you can check its status—but doing so is much less reliable and might cause rate limiiting issues. Stripe enforces [rate limiting](https://docs.stripe.com/testing#rate-limits) on API requests, so exercise caution if you decide to use polling.\n\nTo handle a webhook event, create a route on your server and configure a corresponding webhook endpoint [in the Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/webhooks). Stripe sends the `payment_intent.succeeded` event when a payment succeeds, and the `payment_intent.payment_failed` event when a payment fails.\n\nThe webhook payload includes the PaymentIntent object. The following example shows how to handle both events:\n\n`require 'sinatra' require 'stripe'  post '/webhook' do     payload = request.body.read     sig_header = request.env['HTTP_STRIPE_SIGNATURE']     event = nil      begin         event = Stripe::Webhook.construct_event(             payload, sig_header, endpoint_secret         )     rescue JSON::ParserError => e         # Invalid payload         status 400         return     rescue Stripe::SignatureVerificationError => e         # Invalid signature         status 400         return     end      case event['type']     when 'payment_intent.succeeded'         intent = event['data']['object']         puts \"Succeeded:\", intent['id']         # Fulfill the customer's purchase     when 'payment_intent.payment_failed'         intent = event['data']['object']         error_message = intent['last_payment_error'] && intent['last_payment_error']['message']         puts \"Failed:\", intent['id'], error_message         # Notify the customer that payment failed     end      status 200 end`\n\nWhen payment is unsuccessful, you can find more details by inspecting the PaymentIntent’s `last_payment_error` property. You can notify the customer that their payment didn’t complete and encourage them to try again with a different payment method. Reuse the same PaymentIntent to continue tracking the customer’s purchase.\n\n### Handling specific webhook events ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nThe following list describes how to handle webhook events:\n\n| Event | Description | Next steps |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `processing` | The customer’s payment was submitted to Stripe successfully. Only applicable to payment methods with [delayed success confirmation](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods). | Wait for the initiated payment to succeed or fail. |\n| `succeeded` | The customer’s payment succeeded | Fulfill the purchased goods or services |\n| `amount_capturable_updated` | The customer’s payment is authorized and ready for capture | Capture the funds that are available for payment |\n| `payment_failed` | The customer’s payment was declined by a card network or otherwise expired | Reach out to your customer through email or push notification and prompt them to provide another payment method |\n\nTo test webhooks locally, you can use [Stripe CLI](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-cli). After you install it, you can forward events to your server:\n\n`stripe listen --forward-to localhost:4242/webhook Ready! Your webhook signing secret is '{{WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET}}' (^C to quit)`\n\nLearn more about [setting up webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks).\n\n## Identifying charges on a PaymentIntent ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nWhen you attempt to collect payment from a customer, the PaymentIntent creates a [Charge](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges). To get the ID of the most recent charge, inspect the PaymentIntent’s [latest\\_charge](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-latest_charge) property:\n\n`# Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production. # See your keys here: [https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys) Stripe.api_key =` \n\n`'sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc'`\n\n`intent = Stripe::PaymentIntent.retrieve('{{PAYMENT_INTENT_ID}}') latest_charge = intent.latest_charge`\n\nTo view all of the charges associated with a PaymentIntent, including any unsuccessful charges, [list all charges](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/list#list_charges-payment_intent) and specify the `payment_intent​` parameter.\n\n`curl -G https://api.stripe.com/v1/charges \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d payment_intent=  {{PAYMENT_INTENT_ID}}    `\n\n## Handling next actions ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nSome payment methods require additional steps, such as authentication, to complete the payment process. Stripe.js handles these automatically when confirming the PaymentIntent, but if you have an advanced integration, you might want to handle these manually.\n\nThe PaymentIntent’s [next\\_action](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-next_action) property exposes the next step that your integration must handle to complete the payment. The type of possible next actions can differ between various payment methods. You can find a full list of possible next actions in the [API documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/api#payment_intent_object-next_action-type).\n\nYou can refer to the [payment methods documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/overview) for more details about how to handle their required next actions.",

  "markdown": "# Accept a payment | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Securely accept payments online.\n\nBuild a payment form or use a prebuilt checkout page to start accepting online payments.\n\nBuild a custom payments integration by embedding UI components on your site, using [Stripe Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/elements). See how this integration [compares to Stripe’s other integration types](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment/web/compare-integrations).\n\nThe client-side and server-side code builds a checkout form that accepts various payment methods.\n\nThis demo only displays Google Pay or Apple Pay if you have an active card with either wallet. To see how Link works, type in any email address into the email input.\n\n### Integration effort\n\n### Integration type\n\nCombine UI components into a custom payment flow\n\n### UI customization\n\n#### Interested in using Stripe Tax, discounts, shipping, or currency conversion?\n\nWe’re developing a Payment Element integration that manages tax, discounts, shipping, and currency conversion. Read the [Build a checkout page](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/custom-checkout) guide to learn more.\n\n[](#set-up-stripe)\n\nFirst, [create a Stripe account](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register) or [sign in](https://dashboard.stripe.com/login).\n\nUse our official libraries to access the Stripe API from your application:\n\n`# Available as a gem sudo gem install stripe`\n\n`# If you use bundler, you can add this line to your Gemfile gem 'stripe'`\n\n[](#web-create-intent)\n\n#### Note\n\nThe [PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents) object represents your intent to collect payment from a customer and tracks charge attempts and state changes throughout the payment process.\n\n### Create the PaymentIntent![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nCreate a PaymentIntent on your server with an [amount](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-amount) and [currency](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-currency). In the latest version of the API, specifying the `automatic_payment_methods` parameter is optional because Stripe enables its functionality by default. You can manage payment methods from the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods). Stripe handles the return of eligible payment methods based on factors such as the transaction’s amount, currency, and payment flow.\n\nStripe uses your [payment methods settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) to display the payment methods you have enabled. To see how your payment methods appear to customers, enter a transaction ID or set an order amount and currency in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods/review). To override payment methods, manually list any that you want to enable using the [payment\\_method\\_types](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-payment_method_types) attribute.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/payment_intents \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d amount=1099 \\  -d currency=usd \\  -d \"automatic_payment_methods[enabled]\"=true`\n\nIn the latest version of the API, specifying the `automatic_payment_methods` parameter is optional because Stripe enables its functionality by default.\n\n#### Note\n\nAlways decide how much to charge on the server side, a trusted environment, as opposed to the client. This prevents malicious customers from being able to choose their own prices.\n\n### Retrieve the client secret![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe PaymentIntent includes a [client secret](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-client_secret \"PaymentIntent client secret\") that the client side uses to securely complete the payment process. You can use different approaches to pass the client secret to the client side.\n\nRetrieve the client secret from an endpoint on your server, using the browser’s `fetch` function. This approach is best if your client side is a single-page application, particularly one built with a modern frontend framework like React. Create the server endpoint that serves the client secret:\n\n`get '/secret' do   intent = # ... Create or retrieve the PaymentIntent   {client_secret: intent.client_secret}.to_json end`\n\nAnd then fetch the client secret with JavaScript on the client side:\n\n`(async () => {   const response = await fetch('/secret');   const {client_secret: clientSecret} = await response.json();   // Render the form using the clientSecret })();`\n\n[](#web-collect-payment-details)\n\nCollect payment details on the client with the [Payment Element](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-element). The Payment Element is a prebuilt UI component that simplifies collecting payment details for a variety of payment methods.\n\nThe Payment Element contains an iframe that securely sends payment information to Stripe over an HTTPS connection. Avoid placing the Payment Element within another iframe because some payment methods require redirecting to another page for payment confirmation.\n\nIf you do choose to use an iframe and want to accept Apple Pay or Google Pay, the iframe must have the [allow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe#attr-allowpaymentrequest) attribute set to equal `\"payment *\"`.\n\nThe checkout page address must start with `https://` rather than `http://` for your integration to work. You can test your integration without using HTTPS, but remember to [enable it](https://docs.stripe.com/security/guide#tls) when you’re ready to accept live payments.\n\n### Set up Stripe.js![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe Payment Element is automatically available as a feature of Stripe.js. Include the Stripe.js script on your checkout page by adding it to the `head` of your HTML file. Always load Stripe.js directly from js.stripe.com to remain PCI compliant. Don’t include the script in a bundle or host a copy of it yourself.\n\nCreate an instance of Stripe with the following JavaScript on your checkout page:\n\n`// Set your publishable key: remember to change this to your live publishable key in production // See your keys here: [https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys) const stripe = Stripe(`\n\n`'pk_test_TYooMQauvdEDq54NiTphI7jx'`\n\n`);`\n\n### Add the Payment Element to your payment page![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe Payment Element needs a place to live on your payment page. Create an empty DOM node (container) with a unique ID in your payment form:\n\n`<form id=\"payment-form\">   <div id=\"payment-element\">     <!-- Elements will create form elements here -->   </div>   <button id=\"submit\">Submit</button>   <div id=\"error-message\">     <!-- Display error message to your customers here -->   </div> </form>`\n\nWhen the previous form loads, create an instance of the Payment Element and mount it to the container DOM node. Pass the [client secret](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-client_secret) from the previous step into `options` when you create the [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/js/elements_object/create) instance:\n\nHandle the client secret carefully because it can complete the charge. Don’t log it, embed it in URLs, or expose it to anyone but the customer.\n\n`const options = {   clientSecret: '{{CLIENT_SECRET}}',   // Fully customizable with appearance API.   appearance: {/*...*/}, };  // Set up Stripe.js and Elements to use in checkout form, passing the client secret obtained in a previous step const elements = stripe.elements(options);  // Create and mount the Payment Element const paymentElement = elements.create('payment'); paymentElement.mount('#payment-element');`\n\nThe Payment Element renders a dynamic form that allows your customer to pick a payment method. For each payment method, the form automatically asks the customer to fill in all necessary payment details.\n\n### Customize appearance![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nCustomize the Payment Element to match the design of your site by passing the [appearance object](https://docs.stripe.com/js/elements_object/create#stripe_elements-options-appearance) into `options` when creating the `Elements` provider.\n\n### Collect addresses![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nBy default, the Payment Element only collects the necessary billing address details. To collect a customer’s full billing address (to calculate the tax for digital goods and services, for example) or shipping address, use the [Address Element](https://docs.stripe.com/elements/address-element).\n\n### Request Apple Pay merchant token![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nIf you’ve configured your integration to [accept Apple Pay payments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=web&ui=elements#apple-pay-and-google-pay), we recommend configuring the Apple Pay interface to return a merchant token to enable merchant initiated transactions (MIT). [Request the relevant merchant token type](https://docs.stripe.com/apple-pay/merchant-tokens?pay-element=web-pe) in the Payment Element.\n\n[](#web-submit-payment)\n\nUse [stripe.confirmPayment](https://docs.stripe.com/js/payment_intents/confirm_payment) to complete the payment using details from the Payment Element. Provide a [return\\_url](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-return_url) to this function to indicate where Stripe should redirect the user after they complete the payment. Your user may be first redirected to an intermediate site, like a bank authorization page, before being redirected to the `return_url`. Card payments immediately redirect to the `return_url` when a payment is successful.\n\nIf you don’t want to redirect for card payments after payment completion, you can set [redirect](https://docs.stripe.com/js/payment_intents/confirm_payment#confirm_payment_intent-options-redirect) to `if_required`. This only redirects customers that check out with redirect-based payment methods.\n\n``const form = document.getElementById('payment-form');  form.addEventListener('submit', async (event) => {   event.preventDefault();    const {error} = await stripe.confirmPayment({     //`Elements` instance that was used to create the Payment Element     elements,     confirmParams: {       return_url: '[https://example.com/order/123/complete](https://example.com/order/123/complete)',     },   });    if (error) {     // This point will only be reached if there is an immediate error when     // confirming the payment. Show error to your customer (for example, payment     // details incomplete)     const messageContainer = document.querySelector('#error-message');     messageContainer.textContent = error.message;   } else {     // Your customer will be redirected to your `return_url`. For some payment     // methods like iDEAL, your customer will be redirected to an intermediate     // site first to authorize the payment, then redirected to the `return_url`.   } });``\n\nMake sure the `return_url` corresponds to a page on your website that provides the status of the payment. When Stripe redirects the customer to the `return_url`, we provide the following URL query parameters:\n\n| Parameter | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `payment_intent` | The unique identifier for the `PaymentIntent`. |\n| `payment_intent_client_secret` | The [client secret](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-client_secret) of the `PaymentIntent` object. |\n\n#### Caution\n\nIf you have tooling that tracks the customer’s browser session, you might need to add the `stripe.com` domain to the referrer exclude list. Redirects cause some tools to create new sessions, which prevents you from tracking the complete session.\n\nUse one of the query parameters to retrieve the PaymentIntent. Inspect the [status of the PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/paymentintents/lifecycle) to decide what to show your customers. You can also append your own query parameters when providing the `return_url`, which persist through the redirect process.\n\n`// Initialize Stripe.js using your publishable key const stripe = Stripe(`\n\n`'pk_test_TYooMQauvdEDq54NiTphI7jx'`\n\n``);  // Retrieve the \"payment_intent_client_secret\" query parameter appended to // your return_url by Stripe.js const clientSecret = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search).get(   'payment_intent_client_secret' );  // Retrieve the PaymentIntent stripe.retrievePaymentIntent(clientSecret).then(({paymentIntent}) => {   const message = document.querySelector('#message')    // Inspect the PaymentIntent `status` to indicate the status of the payment   // to your customer.   //   // Some payment methods will [immediately succeed or fail][0] upon   // confirmation, while others will first enter a `processing` state.   //   // [0]: [https://stripe.com/docs/payments/payment-methods#payment-notification](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/payment-methods#payment-notification)   switch (paymentIntent.status) {     case 'succeeded':       message.innerText = 'Success! Payment received.';       break;      case 'processing':       message.innerText = \"Payment processing. We'll update you when payment is received.\";       break;      case 'requires_payment_method':       message.innerText = 'Payment failed. Please try another payment method.';       // Redirect your user back to your payment page to attempt collecting       // payment again       break;      default:       message.innerText = 'Something went wrong.';       break;   } });``\n\n[](#web-post-payment)\n\nStripe sends a [payment\\_intent.succeeded](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-payment_intent.succeeded) event when the payment completes. Use the [Dashboard webhook tool](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks) or follow the [webhook guide](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks/quickstart) to receive these events and run actions, such as sending an order confirmation email to your customer, logging the sale in a database, or starting a shipping workflow.\n\nListen for these events rather than waiting on a callback from the client. On the client, the customer could close the browser window or quit the app before the callback executes, and malicious clients could manipulate the response. Setting up your integration to listen for asynchronous events is what enables you to accept [different types of payment methods](https://stripe.com/payments/payment-methods-guide) with a single integration.\n\nIn addition to handling the `payment_intent.succeeded` event, we recommend handling these other events when collecting payments with the Payment Element:\n\n| Event | Description | Action |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| [payment\\_intent.succeeded](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types?lang=php#event_types-payment_intent.succeeded) | Sent when a customer successfully completes a payment. | Send the customer an order confirmation and fulfill their order. |\n| [payment\\_intent.processing](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types?lang=php#event_types-payment_intent.processing) | Sent when a customer successfully initiates a payment, but the payment has yet to complete. This event is most commonly sent when the customer initiates a bank debit. It’s followed by either a `payment_intent.succeeded` or `payment_intent.payment_failed` event in the future. | Send the customer an order confirmation that indicates their payment is pending. For digital goods, you might want to fulfill the order before waiting for payment to complete. |\n| [payment\\_intent.payment\\_failed](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types?lang=php#event_types-payment_intent.payment_failed) | Sent when a customer attempts a payment, but the payment fails. | If a payment transitions from `processing` to `payment_failed`, offer the customer another attempt to pay. |\n\n[](#web-test-the-integration)\n\nTo test your custom payments integration:\n\n1.  Create a Payment Intent and retrieve the client secret.\n2.  Fill out the payment details with a method from the following table.\n    *   Enter any future date for card expiry.\n    *   Enter any 3-digit number for CVC.\n    *   Enter any billing postal code.\n3.  Submit the payment to Stripe. You’re redirected to your `return_url`.\n4.  Go to the Dashboard and look for the payment on the [Payments page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/payments?status%5B0%5D=successful). If your payment succeeded, you’ll see it in that list.\n5.  Click your payment to see more details, like billing information and the list of purchased items. You can use this information to fulfill the order.\n\nLearn more about [testing your integration](https://docs.stripe.com/testing).\n\n| Card number | Scenario | How to test |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|     | The card payment succeeds and doesn’t require authentication. | Fill out the credit card form using the credit card number with any expiration, CVC, and postal code. |\n|     | The card payment requires [authentication](https://docs.stripe.com/strong-customer-authentication \"Strong Customer Authentication\"). | Fill out the credit card form using the credit card number with any expiration, CVC, and postal code. |\n|     | The card is declined with a decline code like `insufficient_funds`. | Fill out the credit card form using the credit card number with any expiration, CVC, and postal code. |\n|     | The UnionPay card has a variable length of 13-19 digits. | Fill out the credit card form using the credit card number with any expiration, CVC, and postal code. |\n\nSee [Testing](https://docs.stripe.com/testing) for additional information to test your integration.\n\n[](#disclose-cookies)\n\nStripe collects information on customer interactions with Elements to provide services to you, prevent fraud, and improve its services.

  "markdown": "# Create a PaymentIntent | Stripe API Reference\n\nCreates a PaymentIntent object.\n\nAfter the PaymentIntent is created, attach a payment method and [confirm](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/confirm) to continue the payment. Learn more about [the available payment flows with the Payment Intents API](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents).\n\nWhen you use `confirm=true` during creation, it’s equivalent to creating and confirming the PaymentIntent in the same call. You can use any parameters available in the [confirm API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/confirm) when you supply `confirm=true`.\n\n### Parameters\n\n*   Amount intended to be collected by this PaymentIntent. A positive integer representing how much to charge in the [smallest currency unit](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#zero-decimal) (e.g., 100 cents to charge $1.00 or 100 to charge ¥100, a zero-decimal currency). The minimum amount is $0.50 US or [equivalent in charge currency](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts). The amount value supports up to eight digits (e.g., a value of 99999999 for a USD charge of $999,999.99).\n    \n\n*   #### \n    \n    automatic\\_payment\\_methodsobject\n    \n    When you enable this parameter, this PaymentIntent accepts payment methods that you enable in the Dashboard and that are compatible with this PaymentIntent’s other parameters.\n    \n*   Set to `true` to attempt to [confirm this PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/confirm) immediately. This parameter defaults to `false`. When creating and confirming a PaymentIntent at the same time, you can also provide the parameters available in the [Confirm API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/confirm).\n    \n*   ID of the Customer this PaymentIntent belongs to, if one exists.\n    \n    Payment methods attached to other Customers cannot be used with this PaymentIntent.\n    \n    If present in combination with [setup\\_future\\_usage](#payment_intent_object-setup_future_usage), this PaymentIntent’s payment method will be attached to the Customer after the PaymentIntent has been confirmed and any required actions from the user are complete.\n    \n*   An arbitrary string attached to the object. Often useful for displaying to users.\n    \n*   Set of [key-value pairs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/metadata) that you can attach to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format. Individual keys can be unset by posting an empty value to them. All keys can be unset by posting an empty value to `metadata`.\n    \n*   #### \n    \n    off\\_sessionboolean | stringonly when confirm=true\n    \n    Set to `true` to indicate that the customer isn’t in your checkout flow during this payment attempt and can’t authenticate. Use this parameter in scenarios where you collect card details and [charge them later](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/cards/charging-saved-cards). This parameter can only be used with [`confirm=true`](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-confirm).\n    \n*   ID of the payment method (a PaymentMethod, Card, or [compatible Source](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/transitioning#compatibility) object) to attach to this PaymentIntent.\n    \n    If you omit this parameter with `confirm=true`, `customer.default_source` attaches as this PaymentIntent’s payment instrument to improve migration for users of the Charges API. We recommend that you explicitly provide the `payment_method` moving forward.\n    \n*   Email address to send the receipt to. If you specify `receipt_email` for a payment in live mode, you send a receipt regardless of your [email settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/emails).\n    \n*   Indicates that you intend to make future payments with this PaymentIntent’s payment method.\n    \n    Providing this parameter will [attach the payment method](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/save-during-payment) to the PaymentIntent’s Customer, if present, after the PaymentIntent is confirmed and any required actions from the user are complete. If no Customer was provided, the payment method can still be [attached](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods/attach) to a Customer after the transaction completes.\n    \n    When processing card payments, Stripe also uses `setup_future_usage` to dynamically optimize your payment flow and comply with regional legislation and network rules, such as [SCA](https://docs.stripe.com/strong-customer-authentication).\n    \n    Possible enum values\n    \n    |     |\n    | --- |\n    | `off_session`<br><br>Use `off_session` if your customer may or may not be present in your checkout flow. |\n    | `on_session`<br><br>Use `on_session` if you intend to only reuse the payment method when your customer is present in your checkout flow. |\n    \n*   Shipping information for this PaymentIntent.\n    \n*   #### \n    \n    statement\\_descriptorstring\n    \n    For card charges, use [statement\\_descriptor\\_suffix](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/account/statement-descriptors#dynamic). Otherwise, you can use this value as the complete description of a charge on your customers’ statements. It must contain at least one letter and be 1–22 characters long.\n    \n*   #### \n    \n    statement\\_descriptor\\_suffixstring\n    \n    Provides information about a card payment that customers see on their statements. Concatenated with the prefix (shortened descriptor) or statement descriptor that’s set on the account to form the complete statement descriptor.

For example, updating the `payment_method` always requires you to confirm the PaymentIntent again. If you prefer to update and confirm at the same time, we recommend updating properties through the [confirm API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/confirm) instead.\n\n### Parameters\n\n*   Amount intended to be collected by this PaymentIntent.

  "markdown": "# Integration security guide | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Ensure PCI compliance and secure customer-server communications.\n\nAnyone involved with the processing, transmission, or storage of card data must comply with the [Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/pci_security/) (PCI DSS). An independent PCI Qualified Security Assessor (QSA) audited and certified Stripe as a [PCI Level 1 Service Provider](https://www.visa.com/splisting/searchGrsp.do?companyNameCriteria=stripe,%20inc). This is the most stringent level of certification available in the payments industry.\n\n[PCI compliance](https://docs.stripe.com/security/guide#validating-pci-compliance \"PCI compliance\") is a shared responsibility and applies to both Stripe and your business. When accepting payments, you must do so in a PCI compliant manner. The simplest way for you to be PCI compliant is to never see (or have access to) card data at all. Stripe makes this easy for you as we can do the heavy lifting to protect your customers’ card information. You can simplify your PCI compliance as long as you:\n\n*   Use one of our recommended [payments integrations](https://docs.stripe.com/payments) to collect payment information, which is securely transmitted directly to Stripe without it passing through your servers.\n*   Serve your payment pages securely using [Transport Layer Security](#tls) ([TLS](https://docs.stripe.com/security/guide#tls \"TLS\")) so that they make use of HTTPS\n*   Review and [validate](#validating-pci-compliance) your account’s PCI compliance annually.\n\n## Validate your PCI compliance ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nAll Stripe users must validate their PCI compliance annually. Most users can do this with a [Self-Assessment Questionnaire](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/document_library?category=saqs#results) (SAQ) provided by the [PCI Security Standards Council](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/). The type of SAQ depends on how you integrated Stripe and which of the methods below you use to collect card data. Certain methods might require you to upload additional PCI documentation to us. If this is necessary, you can upload them in the Dashboard. If you’re using more than one of the methods below, you don’t need to upload multiple SAQs.\n\nIf you’re not sure how to prove that your business is PCI compliant (for example, a third-party built your integration), we suggest that you talk to a PCI QSA to determine how to best validate your compliance according to the [current guidance](https://pcissc.secure.force.com/faq/articles/Frequently_Asked_Question/If-a-merchant-develops-an-application-that-runs-on-a-consumer-s-device-e-g-smartphone-tablet-or-laptop-that-is-used-to-accept-payment-card-data-what-are-the-merchant-s-obligations-regarding-PCI-DSS-and-PA-DSS-for-that-application) from the PCI Council.\n\n### PCI compliance requirement by integration![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n| Integration | Requirement | Recommendation |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Direct API | SAQ D | When you pass card information directly to Stripe’s API, your integration is directly handling that data and you’re required to annually prove your PCI compliance using the [SAQ D](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/PCI-DSS-v3_2_1-SAQ-D_Merchant.pdf)–the most demanding of the SAQs. To reduce this burden:<br><br>*   Integrate with [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout), [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/elements), or our [mobile SDKs](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment).<br>*   Migrate to [client-side tokenization](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/elements) of card information.<br><br>In addition, our fraud prevention tool, [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar), which includes [risk evaluation](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/risk-evaluation) and [rules](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/rules), is only available when using any of our methods of client-side tokenization. |\n| Checkout or Elements | SAQ A | [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout) and [Stripe.js and Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/elements) host all card data collection inputs within an iframe served from Stripe’s domain (not yours) so your customers’ card information never touches your servers. Because of this, you have the lightest PCI compliance burden. |\n| Connect | SAQ A | If you exclusively collect card data through a Connect platform (for example, Squarespace), we can determine whether the platform provides the necessary PCI documentation. |\n| Dashboard | SAQ C-VT | Manual card payments through the Dashboard are possible for exceptional circumstances only, not routine payment processing. Provide a suitable payment form or mobile application for your customers to enter their card information.<br><br>We can’t verify that manually entered card information is secure outside of Stripe, so you must protect card data in accordance with PCI compliance requirements and complete the [SAQ C-VT](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/PCI-DSS-v3_2_1-SAQ-C_VT.pdf) annually to prove your business is PCI compliant. |\n| Mobile SDK | SAQ A | Stripe’s [mobile SDK](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment) development and change control complies with PCI DSS (requirements 6.3-6.5) and deploys through our PCI validated systems. When you only use UI components from our official SDKs for iOS or Android, or build a payment form with [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/elements) in a WebView, card numbers pass directly from your customers to Stripe, so you have the lightest PCI compliance burden.<br><br>If you do otherwise, such as writing your own code to handle card information, you might be responsible for additional PCI DSS requirements (6.3-6.5) and would be ineligible for an SAQ A. Talk to a PCI QSA to determine how to best validate your compliance according to the [current guidance](https://pcissc.secure.force.com/faq/articles/Frequently_Asked_Question/If-a-merchant-develops-an-application-that-runs-on-a-consumer-s-device-e-g-smartphone-tablet-or-laptop-that-is-used-to-accept-payment-card-data-what-are-the-merchant-s-obligations-regarding-PCI-DSS-and-PA-DSS-for-that-application) from the PCI Council.<br><br>If your application requires your customers to enter their information on their own devices, then you qualify for SAQ A. If your application accepts card information for multiple customers on your device (for example, a point of sale app), consult a [PCI QSA](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/assessors_and_solutions/qualified_security_assessors) to learn how to best validate your PCI compliance. |\n| Stripe.js v2 | SAQ A-EP | Using Stripe.js v2 to pass card data entered in a form hosted on your own site requires completing the [SAQ A-EP](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/PCI-DSS-v3_2_1-SAQ-A_EP.pdf) annually to prove your business is PCI compliant.<br><br>Alternatively, both [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout) and [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/elements) allow you the flexibility and customizability of a self-hosted form, while also meeting PCI eligibility for the SAQ A. |\n| Terminal | SAQ C | If you exclusively collect card data through Stripe Terminal, you can validate using SAQ C.<br><br>If you integrate with Stripe using additional methods listed in this table, you must illustrate compliance for them separately as described. |\n\n#### Warning\n\nIf you’re processing more than 6 million transactions per year with Visa or MasterCard, or more than 2.5 million transactions with American Express, or are otherwise deemed to be a Level 1 provider by any of the card networks, you’re not eligible to use a SAQ to prove PCI compliance. Payment brands require you to complete a [Report on Compliance](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/PCI-DSS-v3_2_1-ROC-Reporting-Template.pdf) (RoC) to validate your PCI compliance annually.\n\n## Use TLS and HTTPS ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nTLS refers to the process of securely transmitting data between the client—the app or browser that your customer is using—and your server. The Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol originally performed this, but is outdated and no longer secure. TLS replaced SSL, but the term _SSL_ continues to be used colloquially when referring to TLS and its function to protect transmitted data.\n\nPayment pages must use a recent version (TLS 1.2 or above) because it significantly reduces the risk of man-in-the-middle attacks for both you and your customers. TLS attempts to accomplish the following:\n\n*   Encrypt and verify the integrity of traffic between the client and your server.\n*   Verify that the client is communicating with the correct server. In practice, this usually means verifying that the owner of the domain and the owner of the server are the same entity. This helps prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. Without it, there’s no guarantee that you’re encrypting traffic to the right recipient.\n\nAdditionally, your customers are more comfortable sharing sensitive information on pages visibly served over HTTPS, which can help increase your customer conversion rate.\n\nYou can [test](https://docs.stripe.com/testing) your integration without using HTTPS if you need to, and enable it when you’re ready to accept live charges. However, all interactions between your server and Stripe must use HTTPS (that is, when using our libraries).\n\n## Set up TLS ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nUsing TLS requires a _digital certificate_—a file issued by a certification authority (CA). Installing this certificate assures the client that it’s actually communicating with the server it expects to be talking to, and not an impostor. Obtain a digital certificate from a reputable certificate provider, such as:\n\n*   [Let’s Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)\n*   [DigiCert](https://www.digicert.com/tls-ssl/basic-tls-ssl-certificates)\n*   [NameCheap](https://www.namecheap.com/security/ssl-certificates.aspx)\n\nCertificates vary in cost, depending on the type of certificate and provider. “Let’s Encrypt” is a certificate authority that provides certificates for free.\n\nTo set up TLS:\n\n1.  Purchase a certificate from a suitable provider.\n2.  Configure your server to use the certificate. This step can be complex, so follow the installation guide of the provider you use.\n\nAs TLS is a complex suite of cryptographic tools, it’s easy to miss a few details. We recommend using the [SSL Server Test](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/) by Qualys SSL Labs to make sure you set up everything in a secure way.\n\n## Security considerations ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nIncluding JavaScript from other sites makes your security dependent on theirs and poses a security risk. If they’re ever compromised, an attacker could execute arbitrary code on your page. In practice, many sites use JavaScript for services like Google Analytics, even on secure pages. Nonetheless, we recommend trying to minimize it.\n\nIf you’re using [webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks \"webhook\"), use TLS for the endpoint to avoid traffic being intercepted and having notifications altered (sensitive information is never included in a webhook event).\n\nWhile complying with the Data Security Standards is important, it shouldn’t be where you stop thinking about security. Some good resources to learn about web security are:\n\n*   [OWASP](https://owasp.org/)\n*   [SANS](https://www.sans.org/reading-room/)\n*   [NIST](http://csrc.nist.gov/)\n\n### Out-of-scope card data that you can safely store ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nStripe returns non-sensitive card information in the response to a charge request. This includes the card type, the last four digits of the card, and the expiration date. This information isn’t subject to PCI compliance, so you’re able to store any of these properties in your database. Additionally, you can store anything returned by our [API](https://docs.stripe.com/api).\n\n### Content Security Policy ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nIf you’ve deployed a [Content Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP \"Content Security Policy\"), the full set of directives that Checkout, Connect embedded components, and Stripe.js require are:\n\n*   `connect-src`, `https://checkout.stripe.com`\n*   `frame-src`, `https://checkout.stripe.com`\n*   `script-src`, `https://checkout.stripe.com`\n*   `img-src`, `https://*.stripe.com`",

Use our official libraries for access to the Stripe API from your server:\n\n`# Available as a gem sudo gem install stripe`\n\n`# If you use bundler, you can add this line to your Gemfile gem 'stripe'`\n\n### Client-side ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nThe [Stripe iOS SDK](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-ios) is open source, [fully documented](https://stripe.dev/stripe-ios/index.html), and compatible with apps supporting iOS 13 or above.\n\nTo install the SDK, follow these steps:\n\n1.  In Xcode, select **File** > **Add Packages…** and enter `https://github.com/stripe/stripe-ios-spm` as the repository URL.\n2.  Select the latest version number from our [releases page](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-ios/releases).\n3.  Add the **StripePaymentSheet** product to the [target of your app](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift_packages/adding_package_dependencies_to_your_app).\n\n[](#ios-enable-payment-methods)\n\nView your [payment methods settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) and enable the payment methods you want to support. You need at least one payment method enabled to create a [PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents \"Payment Intents API\").\n\nBy default, Stripe enables cards and other prevalent payment methods that can help you reach more customers, but we recommend turning on additional payment methods that are relevant for your business and customers. See [Payment method integration options](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/integration-options#payment-method-product-support) for product and payment method support, and our [pricing page](https://stripe.com/pricing/local-payment-methods) for fees.\n\n[](#add-server-endpoint)\n\n#### Note\n\nThis integration uses three Stripe API objects:\n\n1.  [PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents): Stripe uses this to represent your intent to collect payment from a customer, tracking your charge attempts and payment state changes throughout the process.\n    \n2.  (Optional) [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers): To set up a payment method for future payments, you must attach it to a [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers \"Customers\"). Create a Customer object when your customer creates an account with your business. If your customer is making a payment as a guest, you can create a Customer object before payment and associate it with your own internal representation of the customer’s account later.\n    \n3.  (Optional) Customer Ephemeral Key: Information on the Customer object is sensitive, and can’t be retrieved directly from an app. An Ephemeral Key grants the SDK temporary access to the Customer.\n    \n\n#### Note\n\nIf you never save cards to a Customer and don’t allow returning Customers to reuse saved cards, you can omit the Customer and Customer Ephemeral Key objects from your integration.\n\nFor security reasons, your app can’t create these objects. Instead, add an endpoint on your server that:\n\n1.  Retrieves the Customer, or creates a new one.\n2.  Creates an Ephemeral Key for the Customer.\n3.  Creates a PaymentIntent with the [amount](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-amount), [currency](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-currency), and [customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-customer). You can also optionally include the `automatic_payment_methods` parameter. Stripe enables its functionality by default in the latest version of the API.\n4.  Returns the Payment Intent’s [client secret](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-client_secret \"PaymentIntent client secret\"), the Ephemeral Key’s `secret`, the Customer’s [id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-id), and your [publishable key](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys) to your app.\n\nThe payment methods shown to customers during the checkout process are also included on the PaymentIntent. You can let Stripe pull payment methods from your Dashboard settings or you can list them manually. Regardless of the option you choose, know that the currency passed in the PaymentIntent filters the payment methods shown to the customer. For example, if you pass `eur` on the PaymentIntent and have OXXO enabled in the Dashboard, OXXO won’t be shown to the customer because OXXO doesn’t support `eur` payments.\n\nUnless your integration requires a code-based option for offering payment methods, Stripe recommends the automated option. This is because Stripe evaluates the currency, payment method restrictions, and other parameters to determine the list of supported payment methods. Payment methods that increase conversion and that are most relevant to the currency and customer’s location are prioritized.\n\n#### Note\n\nTest a running implementation of this endpoint on [Glitch](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/remix/stripe-mobile-payment-sheet-automatic).\n\nYou can manage payment methods from the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods). Stripe handles the return of eligible payment methods based on factors such as the transaction’s amount, currency, and payment flow. The PaymentIntent is created using the payment methods you configured in the Dashboard. If you don’t want to use the Dashboard or if you want to specify payment methods manually, you can list them using the `payment_method_types` attribute.\n\n`# Create a Customer (use an existing Customer ID if this is a returning customer) curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/customers \\   -u` \n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n``: \\   -X \"POST\"  # Create an Ephemeral Key for the Customer curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/ephemeral_keys \\   -u sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc  : \\   -H \"Stripe-Version: 2024-06-20\" \\   -X \"POST\" \\   -d \"customer\"=\"{{CUSTOMER_ID}}\" \\  # Create a PaymentIntent curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/payment_intents \\   -u sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc  : \\   -X \"POST\" \\   -d \"customer\"=\"{{CUSTOMER_ID}}\" \\   -d \"amount\"=1099 \\   -d \"currency\"=\"eur\" \\   # In the latest version of the API, specifying the `automatic_payment_methods` parameter   # is optional because Stripe enables its functionality by default.   -d \"automatic_payment_methods[enabled]\"=true \\``\n\n[](#ios-collect-payment-details)\n\nTo display the mobile Payment Element on your checkout screen, make sure you:\n\n*   Display the products the customer is purchasing along with the total amount\n*   Use the [Address Element](https://docs.stripe.com/elements/address-element?platform=ios) to collect any required shipping information from the customer\n*   Add a checkout button to display Stripe’s UI\n\nIn your app’s checkout screen, fetch the PaymentIntent client secret, Ephemeral Key secret, Customer ID, and publishable key from the endpoint you created in the previous step. Set your publishable key using `StripeAPI.shared` and initialize [PaymentSheet](https://stripe.dev/stripe-ios/stripe-paymentsheet/Classes/PaymentSheet.html).\n\n``import UIKit import StripePaymentSheet  class CheckoutViewController: UIViewController {   @IBOutlet weak var checkoutButton: UIButton!   var paymentSheet: PaymentSheet?   let backendCheckoutUrl = URL(string: \"Your backend endpoint/payment-sheet\")! // Your backend endpoint    override func viewDidLoad() {     super.viewDidLoad()      checkoutButton.addTarget(self, action: #selector(didTapCheckoutButton), for: .touchUpInside)     checkoutButton.isEnabled = false      // MARK: Fetch the PaymentIntent client secret, Ephemeral Key secret, Customer ID, and publishable key     var request = URLRequest(url: backendCheckoutUrl)     request.httpMethod = \"POST\"     let task = URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: request, completionHandler: { [weak self] (data, response, error) in       guard let data = data,             let json = try?

After the customer completes the payment, Stripe dismisses the PaymentSheet and calls the completion block with [PaymentSheetResult](https://stripe.dev/stripe-ios/stripe-paymentsheet/Enums/PaymentSheetResult.html).\n\n`@objc func didTapCheckoutButton() {   // MARK: Start the checkout process   paymentSheet?.present(from: self) { paymentResult in     // MARK: Handle the payment result     switch paymentResult {     case .completed:       print(\"Your order is confirmed\")     case .canceled:       print(\"Canceled!\")     case .failed(let error):       print(\"Payment failed: \\(error)\")     }   } }`\n\nIf `PaymentSheetResult` is `.completed`, inform the user (for example, by displaying an order confirmation screen).\n\nSetting `allowsDelayedPaymentMethods` to true allows [delayed notification](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#payment-notification) payment methods like US bank accounts. For these payment methods, the final payment status isn’t known when the `PaymentSheet` completes, and instead succeeds or fails later. If you support these types of payment methods, inform the customer their order is confirmed and only fulfill their order (for example, ship their product) when the payment is successful.\n\n[](#ios-set-up-return-url)\n\nThe customer may go out of your app to authenticate, for example, in Safari or their banking app. To allow them to automatically return to your app after authenticating, [configure a custom URL scheme](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/defining-a-custom-url-scheme-for-your-app) or [universal link](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/allowing-apps-and-websites-to-link-to-your-content) and set up your app delegate to forward the URL to the SDK.\n\n`// This method handles opening custom URL schemes (for example, \"your-app://stripe-redirect\") func scene(_ scene: UIScene, openURLContexts URLContexts: Set<UIOpenURLContext>) {     guard let url = URLContexts.first?.url else {         return     }     let stripeHandled = StripeAPI.handleURLCallback(with: url)     if (!stripeHandled) {         // This was not a Stripe url – handle the URL normally as you would     } }`\n\nAdditionally, set the [`returnURL`](https://stripe.dev/stripe-ios/stripe-paymentsheet/Classes/PaymentSheet/Configuration.html#/s:6Stripe12PaymentSheetC13ConfigurationV9returnURLSSSgvp) on your [`PaymentSheet.Configuration`](https://stripe.dev/stripe-ios/stripe-paymentsheet/Classes/PaymentSheet/Configuration.html) object to the URL for your app.\n\n`var configuration = PaymentSheet.Configuration() configuration.returnURL = \"your-app://stripe-redirect\"`\n\n[](#ios-post-payment)\n\nStripe sends a [payment\\_intent.succeeded](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-payment_intent.succeeded) event when the payment completes. Use the [Dashboard webhook tool](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks) or follow the [webhook guide](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks/quickstart) to receive these events and run actions, such as sending an order confirmation email to your customer, logging the sale in a database, or starting a shipping workflow.\n\nListen for these events rather than waiting on a callback from the client. On the client, the customer could close the browser window or quit the app before the callback executes, and malicious clients could manipulate the response. Setting up your integration to listen for asynchronous events is what enables you to accept [different types of payment methods](https://stripe.com/payments/payment-methods-guide) with a single integration.\n\nIn addition to handling the `payment_intent.succeeded` event, we recommend handling these other events when collecting payments with the Payment Element:\n\n| Event | Description | Action |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| [payment\\_intent.succeeded](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types?lang=php#event_types-payment_intent.succeeded) | Sent when a customer successfully completes a payment. | Send the customer an order confirmation and fulfill their order. |\n| [payment\\_intent.processing](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types?lang=php#event_types-payment_intent.processing) | Sent when a customer successfully initiates a payment, but the payment has yet to complete. This event is most commonly sent when the customer initiates a bank debit. It’s followed by either a `payment_intent.succeeded` or `payment_intent.payment_failed` event in the future. | Send the customer an order confirmation that indicates their payment is pending. For digital goods, you might want to fulfill the order before waiting for payment to complete. |\n| [payment\\_intent.payment\\_failed](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types?lang=php#event_types-payment_intent.payment_failed) | Sent when a customer attempts a payment, but the payment fails. | If a payment transitions from `processing` to `payment_failed`, offer the customer another attempt to pay. |\n\n[](#ios-test-the-integration)\n\n| Card number | Scenario | How to test |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|     | The card payment succeeds and doesn’t require authentication. | Fill out the credit card form using the credit card number with any expiration, CVC, and postal code. |\n|     | The card payment requires [authentication](https://docs.stripe.com/strong-customer-authentication \"Strong Customer Authentication\"). | Fill out the credit card form using the credit card number with any expiration, CVC, and postal code. |\n|     | The card is declined with a decline code like `insufficient_funds`. | Fill out the credit card form using the credit card number with any expiration, CVC, and postal code. |\n|     | The UnionPay card has a variable length of 13-19 digits. | Fill out the credit card form using the credit card number with any expiration, CVC, and postal code. |\n\nSee [Testing](https://docs.stripe.com/testing) for additional information to test your integration.",

For these payment methods, the final payment status isn’t known when the `PaymentSheet` completes, and instead succeeds or fails later. If you support these types of payment methods, inform the customer their order is confirmed and only fulfill their order (for example, ship their product) when the payment is successful.\n\n[\n\n## Handle post-payment events![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n\n\n](#android-post-payment)\n\nStripe sends a [payment\\_intent.succeeded](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-payment_intent.succeeded) event when the payment completes. Use the [Dashboard webhook tool](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks) or follow the [webhook guide](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks/quickstart) to receive these events and run actions, such as sending an order confirmation email to your customer, logging the sale in a database, or starting a shipping workflow.\n\nListen for these events rather than waiting on a callback from the client. On the client, the customer could close the browser window or quit the app before the callback executes, and malicious clients could manipulate the response. Setting up your integration to listen for asynchronous events is what enables you to accept [different types of payment methods](https://stripe.com/payments/payment-methods-guide) with a single integration.\n\nIn addition to handling the `payment_intent.succeeded` event, we recommend handling these other events when collecting payments with the Payment Element:\n\n| Event | Description | Action |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| [payment\\_intent.succeeded](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types?lang=php#event_types-payment_intent.succeeded) | Sent when a customer successfully completes a payment. | Send the customer an order confirmation and fulfill their order. |\n| [payment\\_intent.processing](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types?lang=php#event_types-payment_intent.processing) | Sent when a customer successfully initiates a payment, but the payment has yet to complete. This event is most commonly sent when the customer initiates a bank debit. It’s followed by either a `payment_intent.succeeded` or `payment_intent.payment_failed` event in the future. | Send the customer an order confirmation that indicates their payment is pending. For digital goods, you might want to fulfill the order before waiting for payment to complete. |\n| [payment\\_intent.payment\\_failed](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types?lang=php#event_types-payment_intent.payment_failed) | Sent when a customer attempts a payment, but the payment fails. | If a payment transitions from `processing` to `payment_failed`, offer the customer another attempt to pay. |\n\n[\n\n## Test the integration![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n\n\n](#android-test-the-integration)\n\n| Card number | Scenario | How to test |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|     | The card payment succeeds and doesn’t require authentication. | Fill out the credit card form using the credit card number with any expiration, CVC, and postal code. |\n|     | The card payment requires [authentication](https://docs.stripe.com/strong-customer-authentication \"Strong Customer Authentication\"). | Fill out the credit card form using the credit card number with any expiration, CVC, and postal code. |\n|     | The card is declined with a decline code like `insufficient_funds`. | Fill out the credit card form using the credit card number with any expiration, CVC, and postal code. |\n|     | The UnionPay card has a variable length of 13-19 digits. | Fill out the credit card form using the credit card number with any expiration, CVC, and postal code. |\n\nSee [Testing](https://docs.stripe.com/testing) for additional information to test your integration.",

Stripe Terminal offers pre-certified readers and Tap to Pay, which allows users to accept in-person contactless payments with a compatible [iPhone](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/setup-reader/tap-to-pay?platform=ios) or [Android](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/setup-reader/tap-to-pay?platform=android) device and the Stripe Terminal SDK. Hardware must be shipped to physical addresses (not PO boxes). If you’re outside the available countries, you can [request an invite](https://stripe.com/terminal#request-invite) to test Terminal.\n\n## Features ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nUse Terminal to take the complexity out of in-person payments:\n\n*   **Online compatibility**: Unify your online and in-person payments in a single system.\n*   **Flexible SDKs**: Use Terminal’s JavaScript, iOS, Android, or React Native SDK to integrate your existing point of sale (POS), or build a modern POS tailored to your business. Use the [server-driven integration](https://support.stripe.com/questions/terminal-server-driven-integration) to integrate directly using the Stripe API.\n*   **Reader choices**: Choose from [different readers](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/setup-reader) depending on your business needs.\n*   **Connection types**: [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/connect-reader) to your Terminal reader with Bluetooth, USB (Android with mobile readers only), or internet, depending on your physical sales environment.\n*   **Ordering and fleet management from the Stripe Dashboard**: Order [pre-certified readers](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/fleet/order-and-return-readers) and [monitor your fleet of readers](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/fleet/locations-and-zones) from the Stripe Dashboard.\n\n## How Terminal works ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nA Stripe Terminal deployment consists of four main components:\n\n*   Your web-based, mobile, or desktop application\n*   Your backend\n*   A Stripe Terminal reader\n*   The Stripe Terminal SDK\n\nThe SDK facilitates communication between your point of sale application logic, the firmware running on the reader, and the Stripe API so you can accept in-person payments in the same way as you accept online payments with Stripe. The SDK is available for JavaScript, iOS, Android applications. You can develop desktop applications using a server-driven integration.\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/ecosystem-diagram.96b4137c8fbb6e9e7c91d97a27289e01.png)\n\nStripe Terminal offers a selection of [pre-certified readers](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/setup-reader) that accept payment details (EMV, contactless, and swiped), encrypt sensitive card information, and return a token to your application (through the Stripe Terminal SDK) so you can confirm payment.\n\nStripe Terminal works only with our pre-certified card readers and compatible Tap to Pay [iPhone](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/setup-reader/tap-to-pay?platform=ios) and [Android](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/setup-reader/tap-to-pay?platform=android) devices. This ensures secure transactions by our end-to-end encryption, by default, and up-to-date readers through our remote management tools.\n\nYou can [order readers and accessories](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/fleet/order-and-return-readers) from the Stripe Dashboard and get them shipped to a location of your choice. As a [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect) platform, you can even enable your connected accounts to receive readers and accessories at their business location.\n\n## Use cases ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nStripe Terminal is built with developers in mind. Its flexible design supports a wide range of use cases:\n\n*   Extend your online business to the physical world.\n*   Enable in-person payments for your [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect) platform, with readers for each connected account.\n*   Collect payments in-person and use those card details for recurring online payments with [Billing](https://docs.stripe.com/billing).\n*   Build a new, customized point of sale application or integrate with your existing point of sale application, while taking advantage of the Stripe API for processing payments.\n\nChoose an SDK that works best for you and combine it with a reader that works best for you. This documentation provides all the information you need to design your in-person payments solution, order readers and accessories, integrate, and deploy.\n\n## Scope of integration ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nThe full scope of an integration consists of four major steps.\n\n1.  Use the [sample integration](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/quickstart) to get up and running with an integration quickly.\n2.  [Design your integration](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/designing-integration) to create in-person payments.\n3.  [Integrate the SDK](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/setup-integration) in your application. Use the simulated reader to emulate reader behavior for all the Terminal flows while building your initial integration.\n4.  [Order](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/fleet/order-and-return-readers) a physical reader and test card.\n\nFrom there, explore the docs to see all you can do with your Terminal integration. We recommend [testing your integration](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/references/testing) and reviewing the [checklist](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/references/checklist) before going live.",

  "markdown": "# Set up future payments | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\nTo collect customer payment details that you can reuse later, use Checkout’s setup mode. Setup mode uses the [Setup Intents API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_intents) to create [Payment Methods](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods).\n\nCheck out our [full, working sample on GitHub](https://github.com/stripe-samples/checkout-remember-me-with-twilio-verify).\n\n[](#set-up-stripe)\n\nFirst, you need a Stripe account. [Register now](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register).\n\nUse our official libraries to access the Stripe API from your application:\n\n`# Available as a gem sudo gem install stripe`\n\n`# If you use bundler, you can add this line to your Gemfile gem 'stripe'`\n\n[](#create-checkout-session)\n\nAdd a checkout button to your website that calls a server-side endpoint to create a Checkout Session.\n\n`<html>   <head>     <title>Checkout</title>   </head>   <body>     <form action=\"/create-checkout-session\" method=\"POST\">       <button type=\"submit\">Checkout</button>     </form>   </body> </html>`\n\nTo create a setup mode Session, use the `mode` parameter with a value of `setup` when creating the Session. You can optionally specify the [customer parameter](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-customer) to automatically attach the created payment method to an existing customer. Checkout uses [Dynamic payment methods](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/dynamic-payment-methods) by default, which requires you to pass the [currency](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-currency) parameter when using `setup` mode.\n\nAppend the `{CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}` template variable to the `success_url` to get access to the Session ID after your customer successfully completes a Checkout Session. After creating the Checkout Session, redirect your customer to the [URL](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/object#checkout_session_object-url) returned in the response.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/checkout/sessions \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d mode=setup \\  -d currency=usd \\  -d customer={{CUSTOMER_ID}} \\   --data-urlencode success_url=\"https://example.com/success?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}\"`\n\n[](#retrieve-checkout-session)\n\nAfter a customer successfully completes their Checkout Session, you need to retrieve the Session object. There are two ways to do this:\n\n*   **Asynchronously**: Handle `checkout.session.completed` [webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks \"webhook\"), which contain a Session object. Learn more about [setting up webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks).\n*   **Synchronously**: Obtain the Session ID from the `success_url` when a user redirects back to your site. Use the Session ID to [retrieve](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/retrieve) the Session object.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/checkout/sessions/cs_test_MlZAaTXUMHjWZ7DcXjusJnDU4MxPalbtL5eYrmS2GKxqscDtpJq8QM0k \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\"`\n\nThe right choice depends on your tolerance for dropoff, as customers may not always reach the `success_url` after a successful payment. It’s possible for them close their browser tab before the redirect occurs. Handling webhooks prevents your integration from being susceptible to this form of dropoff.\n\nAfter you have retrieved the Session object, get the value of the `setup_intent` key, which is the ID for the SetupIntent created during the Checkout Session. A [SetupIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/setup-intents) is an object used to set up the customer’s bank account information for future payments.\n\nExample `checkout.session.completed` payload:\n\n`{   \"id\": \"evt_1Ep24XHssDVaQm2PpwS19Yt0\",   \"object\": \"event\",   \"api_version\": \"2019-03-14\",   \"created\": 1561420781,   \"data\": {     \"object\": {       \"id\": \"cs_test_MlZAaTXUMHjWZ7DcXjusJnDU4MxPalbtL5eYrmS2GKxqscDtpJq8QM0k\",       \"object\": \"checkout.session\",       \"billing_address_collection\": null,       \"client_reference_id\": null,       \"customer\": \"\",       \"customer_email\": null,       \"display_items\": [],       \"mode\": \"setup\",       \"setup_intent\": \"seti_1EzVO3HssDVaQm2PJjXHmLlM\",       \"submit_type\": null,       \"subscription\": null,       \"success_url\": \"[https://example.com/success](https://example.com/success)\"     }   },   \"livemode\": false,   \"pending_webhooks\": 1,   \"request\": {     \"id\": null,     \"idempotency_key\": null   },   \"type\": \"checkout.session.completed\" }`\n\nNote the `setup_intent` ID for the next step.\n\n[](#retrieve-setup-intent)\n\nUsing the `setup_intent` ID, [retrieve](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_intents/retrieve) the SetupIntent object. The returned object contains a `payment_method` ID that you can attach to a customer in the next step.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/setup_intents/seti_1EzVO3HssDVaQm2PJjXHmLlM \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\"`\n\n#### Note\n\nIf you’re requesting this information synchronously from the Stripe API (as opposed to handling webhooks), you can combine the previous step with this step by [expanding](https://docs.stripe.com/api/expanding_objects) the SetupIntent object in the request to the /v1/checkout/session endpoint. Doing this prevents you from having to make two network requests to access the newly created PaymentMethod ID.\n\n[](#use-payment-method)\n\nIf you didn’t create the Checkout Session with an existing customer, use the `payment_method` ID to [attach](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods/attach) the [PaymentMethod](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods \"PaymentMethods\") to a [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers \"Customers\"). After you attach the PaymentMethod to a customer, you can charge the PaymentMethod using a [PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-payment_method).\n\n[](#disclose-cookies)\n\nStripe collects information on customer interactions with Elements to provide services to you, prevent fraud, and improve its services. This includes using cookies and IP addresses to identify which Elements a customer saw during a single checkout session. You’re responsible for disclosing and obtaining all rights and consents necessary for Stripe to use data in these ways.

Then, when you [connect to your reader](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/connect-reader), specify one of those locations.\n\nLocations represent physical places where your readers operate. Stripe needs location information to process payments correctly and keep your reader up to date. If your business requires you to move your readers frequently, your locations can use addresses that represent a primary place of business.\n\n## Prototyping![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nWhen you first begin writing your application, you can test it with a simulated reader and simulated cards. The [Terminal Quickstart](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/quickstart) demonstrates an app at this stage of development.\n\nWhen you’re ready to work with actual hardware, follow these steps:\n\n1.  [Order an M2 reader and physical test cards](https://dashboard.stripe.com/terminal/shop).\n2.  Connect to the reader [using Bluetooth](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/connect-reader?reader-type=bluetooth) or [USB](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/connect-reader?reader-type=usb).\n3.

Your point of sale application communicates with a reader through the Terminal SDK to collect in-person payments from your customers. Your backend works with your point of sale application to authenticate the Terminal SDK and finalize payments.\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/example-app-simulator-integration-architecture.c687f5119cda8972233e61f684ae56a5.png)\n\nBefore starting your own integration, we recommend setting up one of the Terminal example applications. This will give you a better feel for how the components of a Terminal integration fit together and show you the interactions between the SDK, the reader, your point of sale application, and your backend code.\n\n[](#set-up-backend)\n\nTo get started with the example applications, set up the Sinatra-based [example backend](https://github.com/stripe/example-terminal-backend) by following the instructions in the [README](https://github.com/stripe/example-terminal-backend). You can either run the backend locally or deploy it to Render with a free account. The example backend works with the example application to authenticate the Terminal SDK and finalize payments.\n\n[](#run-example-app)\n\nBuild and run one of the example applications:\n\n1.  Clone the example from [GitHub](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-terminal-js-demo):\n\n1.  Run the following commands to run the example:\n\n`cd stripe-terminal-js-demo npm install npm run start`\n\n1.  In the running example, enter the URL of the example backend that you deployed in [step 1](#set-up-backend).\n\n[](#connect-simulated-reader)\n\nAfter you have the example running, select **Use simulator** to connect to a [simulated reader](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/references/testing#simulated-reader).\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/js-example-app-simulator.c226b6ba5461d0c5b3b8f06c0c1a3469.png)\n\nThe JavaScript example app connected to a simulated reader\n\nThe simulated reader handles events just like a physical reader, so you can continue to collecting your first payment.\n\nThe simulated reader functionality is built into the SDK, so you can use it to develop and test your own point of sale application without connecting to a physical device.\n\n[](#collect-payment)\n\nCollect your first payment using the example application and a simulated reader. Each of the examples features an event log for you to reference as you integrate Terminal in your own application. As you collect your first payment, you’ll see the following sequence:\n\n*   **Create payment**: The example application collects a payment method using the SDK.\n*   **Collect payment method**: The simulated reader receives a card.\n*   **Process and capture**: The example application and backend finalize the payment.\n\n#### Note\n\n![Javascript example app connected to simulated reader](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/js-example-app-payment.8069a69561566519d001038a46bfe6b5.png)\n\nCollecting a payment, using the JavaScript example app and a simulated reader",

Because these settings are hierarchical, you can apply a configuration at either the account level or at the individual location level. You can set configurations in the following ways:\n\n*   On individual [Locations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/locations): Applies to all readers registered to that Location\n*   At the account level: Applies to all readers in your fleet\n\nYou can override account-level settings with location-level settings. If you don’t configure settings at the location level, they inherit the account-level settings.\n\n#### Note\n\nWe don’t support assigning or adding configurations to zones.\n\nFor example, you can model your `Configuration` objects as follows:\n\n![Configuration Hierarchy](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/configuration-object-tree.5ec745ad57500a800c4f34f0a970224e.png)\n\nIn this scenario, Location 3 inherits the configurations from the account “Default configuration”, while Locations 1 and 2 have their own configuration.\n\n#### Note\n\nIf you don’t set a configuration on the location-level, the Location inherits the default configuration on the account. For example, if you don’t set the splash screen on the Location, it inherits it from the default configuration set at the account level.\n\nAny configuration changes made with the API or Dashboard can take up to 10 minutes to reflect on the target readers.\n\nYou can view and manage your configurations in the Stripe Dashboard. To manage your configurations, click **Manage locations** on the Readers tab. Stripe displays a list of configurations on the right hand side of the page.

  "markdown": "# Regional considerations | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Learn about regional considerations for integrating Terminal in different countries.\n\n​​For the most part, you’ll be able to use a single Terminal integration in all supported countries. However, due to local payment methods or regulations there are some country-specific requirements. After going through the [sample integration](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/quickstart), use this guide to learn about country-specific requirements for Terminal.\n\n#### Note\n\nIn order to process Terminal payments, both the Stripe account receiving the funds and the [location](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/fleet/locations-and-zones) associated with the reader must be in the same country, accepting local currency only.\n\n## Availability![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nRefer to the following table to understand which readers

  "markdown": "# Collect card payments | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\nFor BBPOS WisePOS E and Stripe Reader S700, we recommend server-side integration because it uses the Stripe API instead of a Terminal SDK to collect payments.\n\nCollecting payments with Stripe Terminal requires writing a payment flow in your application. Use the Stripe Terminal SDK to create and update a [PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api#payment_intents), an object representing a single payment session.\n\nWhile the core concepts are similar to SDK-based integrations, you follow slightly different steps with the server-driven integration:\n\n1.  [Create a PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/collect-card-payment?terminal-sdk-platform=server-driven#create-payment). You can define whether to [automatically](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-capture_method) or [manually](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/place-a-hold-on-a-payment-method) capture your payments.\n2.  [Process the payment](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/collect-card-payment?terminal-sdk-platform=server-driven#process-payment). Authorization on the customer’s card takes place when the reader processes the payment.\n3.  (Optional) [Capture the PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/collect-card-payment?terminal-sdk-platform=server-driven#capture-payment)\n\n[](#create-payment)\n\nThe first step in collecting payments is to start the payment flow. When a customer begins checking out, your backend must create a [PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents) object that represents a new payment session on Stripe. With the server-driven integration, you create the PaymentIntent server-side.\n\nIn test mode, you can use [test amounts](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/references/testing#standard-test-cards) to simulate different error scenarios. In live mode, the amount of the PaymentIntent displays on the reader for payment.\n\nFor Terminal payments, the `payment_method_types` parameter must include `card_present`.\n\nTo accept Interac payments in Canada, you must also include `interac_present` in `payment_method_types`. Learn about [regional considerations for Canada](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/regional?integration-country=CA#create-a-paymentintent).\n\nYou can control the payment flow as follows:\n\n*   To fully control the payment flow for `card_present` payments, set the `capture_method` to `manual`. This allows you to add a reconciliation step before finalizing the payment.\n*   To authorize and capture payments in one step, set the `capture_method` to `automatic`.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/payment_intents \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d currency=usd \\  -d \"payment_method_types[]\"=card_present \\  -d capture_method=manual \\  -d amount=1000`\n\n[](#process-payment)\n\nYou can process a payment immediately with the card presented by a customer, or instead inspect card details before proceeding to process the payment. For most use cases, we recommend processing immediately, as it is a simpler integration with less API calls and webhook events. However, if you would like to insert your own business logic before the card is authorized, you can use the two-step collect-and-confirm flow.\n\nAfter you create a PaymentIntent, the next step is to process the payment. The reader prompts the customer to insert or tap their card and then authorizes the payment.\n\nTo collect payment, make a request to Stripe with the ID of the PaymentIntent you created and the reader you want to use for the transaction.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/terminal/readers/tmr_xxx/process_payment_intent \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d payment_intent=pi_xxx`\n\nProcessing the payment happens asynchronously. A cardholder might take a few seconds to get their card from their wallet or pose a question to the operator during payment. When you process a payment, Stripe immediately responds to the request with an HTTP `200` status code and returns a [reader](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers) with an action status of `in_progress`.\n\nSimultaneously, the reader screen switches to a UI that prompts the customer to insert their card. To [verify the reader state](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/collect-card-payment?terminal-sdk-platform=server-driven#verify-reader), listen to the `terminal.reader.action_succeeded` webhook or poll the Reader and PaymentIntent status to receive the status of the payment.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/terminal/readers/tmr_xxx \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\"`\n\n`{   \"id\": \"tmr_xxx\",   \"object\": \"terminal.reader\",   ...   \"status\": \"online\",   \"action\": {     \"type\": \"process_payment_intent\",     \"process_payment_intent\": {       \"payment_intent\": \"pi_xxx\"     },     \"status\": \"in_progress\",     \"failure_code\": null,     \"failure_message\": null   } }`\n\nIf you’re using a simulated reader, use the [present\\_payment\\_method](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/references/testing#simulated-card-presentment) endpoint to simulate a cardholder tapping or inserting their card on the reader. Use [test cards](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/references/testing#standard-test-cards) to simulate different success or failure scenarios.\n\n[](#capture-payment)\n\nIf you defined `capture_method` as `manual` during PaymentIntent creation in [Step 1](#create-payment), the SDK returns an authorized but not captured PaymentIntent to your application. Learn more about the difference between [authorization and capture](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/place-a-hold-on-a-payment-method). When your application receives a confirmed PaymentIntent, make sure it notifies your backend to capture the PaymentIntent. To do so, create an endpoint on your backend that accepts a PaymentIntent ID and sends a request to the Stripe API to capture it.\n\n`curl -X POST https://api.stripe.com/v1/payment_intents/pi_xxx/capture \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\"`\n\nA successful capture call results in a PaymentIntent with a status of `succeeded`.\n\n#### Warning\n\nYou must manually capture `PaymentIntents` within two days or the authorization expires and funds are released to the customer.\n\n[](#verify-reader)\n\nTo make sure the reader completed an action, your application must verify the reader state before initiating a new reader action or continuing to capture the payment. In most cases, this verification allows you to confirm a successful (approved) payment and show any relevant UX to your operator for them to complete the transaction. In other cases, you might need to [handle errors](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/collect-card-payment?terminal-sdk-platform=api#handle-errors), including declined payments.\n\nUse one of the following to check the reader status:\n\n*   [Listen to webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/collect-card-payment?terminal-sdk-platform=server-driven#webhooks)\n*   [Poll the Stripe API](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/collect-card-payment?terminal-sdk-platform=server-driven#stripe-api)\n*   [Use the PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/collect-card-payment?terminal-sdk-platform=server-driven#payment-intent)\n*   [Use the reader object](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/collect-card-payment?terminal-sdk-platform=server-driven#reader-object)\n\n#### Listen to webhooks Recommended![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nFor maximum resiliency, we recommend your application listens to [webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks) from Stripe to receive real-time notifications of the reader status. Stripe sends three webhooks to notify your application of a reader’s action status:\n\n| Status | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `terminal.reader.action_succeeded` | Sent when a reader action succeeds, such as when a payment is authorized successfully. |\n| `terminal.reader.action_failed` | Sent when a reader action fails, such as when a card is declined due to insufficient funds. |\n| `terminal.reader.action_updated` Beta | Sent when a reader action is updated, such as when a payment method is collected (only triggered for the `collect_payment_method` action). |\n\nTo listen for these webhooks, create a [webhook](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks) endpoint. We recommend having a dedicated webhook endpoint for only these events because they’re high priority and in the critical payment path.\n\nTo retrieve `terminal.reader.action_updated` events, webhook endpoints must have the `terminal_collect_confirm_beta` beta header set. Create webhooks to have the same API version and beta header as your `collect_payment_method` and `confirm_payment_intent` calls.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/webhook_endpoints \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d \"enabled_events[]\"=\"terminal.reader.action_succeeded\" \\  -d \"enabled_events[]\"=\"terminal.reader.action_failed\" \\   --data-urlencode url=\"[https://example.com/my/webhook/endpoint](https://example.com/my/webhook/endpoint)\"`\n\n#### Poll the Stripe API ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nIn case of webhook delivery issues, you can poll the Stripe API by adding a `check status` button to your point of sale interface that the operator can invoke, if needed.\n\n#### Use the PaymentIntent ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nYou can retrieve the PaymentIntent that you passed to the reader for processing. When you create a PaymentIntent it has an initial status of `requires_payment_method`. After you successfully collect the payment method, the status updates to `requires_confirmation`. After the payment processes successfully, the status updates to `requires_capture`.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/payment_intents/`\n\n`{{PAYMENT_INTENT_ID}}`\n\n `\\  -u \"  sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc  :\"`\n\n#### Use the reader object ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nYou can use the [Reader](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/object) object, which contains an [action](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/object#terminal_reader_object-action) attribute that shows the latest action received by the reader and its status. Your application can [retrieve a Reader](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/retrieve) to check if the [status](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/object#terminal_reader_object-action-status) of the reader action has changed.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/terminal/readers/tmr_xxx \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\"`\n\nThe Reader object is also returned as the response to the process payment step. The `action` type when processing a payment is `process_payment_intent`.\n\nThe `action.status` updates to `succeeded` for a successful payment. This means you can proceed with completing the transaction. Other values for `action.status` include `failed` or `in_progress`.\n\n[\n\n## Handle errors![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n\n\n](#handle-errors)\n\nThe following errors are the most common types your application needs to handle:\n\n*   [Avoiding double charges](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/collect-card-payment?terminal-sdk-platform=server-driven#avoiding-double-charges)\n*   [Payment failures](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/collect-card-payment?terminal-sdk-platform=server-driven#payment-failures)\n*   [Payment timeout](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/collect-card-payment?terminal-sdk-platform=server-driven#payment-timeout)\n*   [Payment cancellation](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/collect-card-payment?terminal-sdk-platform=server-driven#payment-cancellation)\n*   [Reader busy](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/collect-card-payment?terminal-sdk-platform=server-driven#reader-busy)\n*   [Reader timeout](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/collect-card-payment?terminal-sdk-platform=server-driven#reader-timeout)\n*   [Reader offline](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/collect-card-payment?terminal-sdk-platform=server-driven#reader-offline)\n*   [Missing webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/collect-card-payment?terminal-sdk-platform=server-driven#missing-webhooks)\n*   [Delayed webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/collect-card-payment?terminal-sdk-platform=server-driven#delayed-webhooks)\n\n### Avoiding double charges ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nThe PaymentIntent object enables money movement at Stripe—use a single PaymentIntent to represent a transaction.\n\nRe-use the same PaymentIntent after a card is declined (for example, if it has insufficient funds), so your customer can try again with a different card.\n\nIf you edit the PaymentIntent, you must call [process\\_payment\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/process_payment_intent) to update the payment information on the reader.\n\nA PaymentIntent must be in the `requires_payment_method` state before Stripe can process it. An authorized, captured, or canceled PaymentIntent can’t be processed by a reader and results in an `intent_invalid_state` error:\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/terminal/readers/tmr_xxx/process_payment_intent \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d payment_intent=pi_xxx`\n\n### Payment failures ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nThe most common payment failure is a failed payment authorization (for example, a payment that’s declined by the customer’s bank due to insufficient funds).\n\nWhen a payment authorization fails, Stripe sends the `terminal.reader.action_failed` webhook. Check the [action.failure\\_code](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/object#terminal_reader_object-action-failure_code) and [action.failure\\_message](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/object#terminal_reader_object-action-failure_message) attributes to know why a payment is declined:\n\n`{   \"id\": \"tmr_xxx\",   \"object\": \"terminal.reader\",   \"action\": {     \"failure_code\": \"card_declined\",     \"failure_message\": \"Your card has insufficient funds.\",     \"process_payment_intent\": {       \"payment_intent\": \"pi_xxx\"     },     \"status\": \"failed\",     \"type\": \"process_payment_intent\"   },   ... }`\n\nIn the case of a declined card, prompt the customer for an alternative form of payment. Use the same PaymentIntent in another request to the [process\\_payment\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/object#terminal_reader_object-action-process_payment_intent) endpoint. If you create a new PaymentIntent, you must [cancel](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/cancel) the failed PaymentIntent to prevent double charges.\n\nFor card read errors (for example, an error reading the chip), the reader automatically prompts the customer to retry without any notification to your application. If multiple retries fail, you can prompt for another payment method by making another [process\\_payment\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/object#terminal_reader_object-action-process_payment_intent) request.\n\n### Payment timeout ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nA reader with unreliable internet connectivity can fail to process a payment because of a networking request timeout when authorizing the card. The reader shows a processing screen for several seconds, followed by a failure screen, and you receive a `terminal.reader.action_failed` webhook with a `failure_code` of `connection_error`:\n\n`{   \"id\": \"tmr_xxx\",   \"object\": \"terminal.reader\",   \"action\": {     \"failure_code\": \"connection_error\",     \"failure_message\": \"Could not connect to Stripe.\",     \"process_payment_intent\": {       \"payment_intent\": \"pi_xxx\"     },     \"status\": \"failed\",     \"type\": \"process_payment_intent\"   },   ... }`\n\nThe payment confirmation request might have been processed by Stripe’s backend systems, but the reader might have disconnected before receiving the response from Stripe. When receiving a webhook with this failure code, fetch the PaymentIntent `status` to verify if the payment is successfully authorized.\n\nMake sure your network meets our [network requirements](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/network-requirements) to minimize timeouts.\n\n### Payment cancellation ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\n#### Programmatic cancellation![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYou might need to cancel an in-flight payment. For example, if a customer adds items to their purchase after your integration has already initiated payment collection on the reader. Use the [cancel\\_action](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/object#terminal_reader_object-action-cancel_action) endpoint to reset the reader:\n\n`curl -X POST https://api.stripe.com/v1/terminal/readers/tmr_xxx/cancel_action \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\"`\n\n#### Note\n\nYou can’t cancel a reader action in the middle of a payment authorization. If a customer has already presented their card to pay on the reader, you must wait for processing to complete. An authorization normally takes a few seconds to complete. Calling [cancel\\_action](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/object#terminal_reader_object-action-cancel_action) during an authorization results in a `terminal_reader_busy` error.\n\n#### Customer-initiated cancellation![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nUsers can set the value of `enable_customer_cancellation` on these endpoints:\n\n*   [`process_payment_intent`](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/process_payment_intent)\n*   [`process_setup_intent`](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/process_setup_intent)\n*   [`collect_payment_method`](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/collect_payment_method)\n*   [`refund_payment`](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/refund_payment)\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/terminal/readers/tmr_xxx/process_payment_intent \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d payment_intent=pi_xxx \\  -d \"process_config[enable_customer_cancellation]\"=true`\n\nWhen set to true, smart reader users see a cancel button.\n\n![Payment collection screen with customer cancellation button](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/customer-cancellation-light-mode.c9ff8361795a2bf4d9e307eee8669775.png)\n\nPayment collection with cancellation enabled\n\nTapping the cancel button cancels the active transaction. Stripe sends a `terminal.reader.action_failed` webhook with a failure\\_code of `customer_canceled`.\n\n`{   \"action\": {     \"failure_code\": \"customer_canceled\",     \"failure_message\": \"This action could not be completed due to an error on the card reader.\",     \"process_payment_intent\": {       \"payment_intent\": \"pi_xxx\",       \"process_config\": {         \"enable_customer_cancellation\": true       }     },     \"status\": \"failed\",     \"type\": \"process_payment_intent\"   } }`\n\n### Reader busy ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nA reader can only process one request at a time. If you make two API requests to the same reader in parallel, one of them fails with a `terminal_reader_busy` error:\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/terminal/readers/tmr_xxx/process_payment_intent \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d payment_intent=pi_xxx`\n\nA reader also rejects an API request if it’s busy performing updates or changing settings.\n\n### Reader timeout ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nOn rare occasions, a reader might fail to respond to an API request on time because of temporary networking issues. If this happens, you receive a `terminal_reader_timeout` error code:\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/terminal/readers/tmr_xxx/process_payment_intent \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d payment_intent=pi_xxx`\n\nIn this case, we recommend you retry the API request. Make sure your network meets our [network requirements](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/network-requirements) to minimize timeouts.\n\nOn rare occasions, a `terminal_reader_timeout` error code is a false negative. In this scenario, you receive a `terminal_reader_timeout` error from the API as described above, but the reader has actually received the command successfully. False negatives happen when Stripe sends a message to the reader, but doesn’t receive an acknowledgement back from the reader due to temporary networking failures.\n\n### Reader offline ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nA location losing its internet connection might result in interrupted communication between the reader and Stripe. In this case, a reader is unresponsive to events initiated from your point of sale application and backend infrastructure.\n\nA reader that consistently fails to respond to API requests is most likely powered off (for example, the power cord is disconnected or it’s out of battery) or not correctly connected to the internet.\n\nA reader is considered offline if Stripe hasn’t received any signal from that reader in the past 2 minutes. Attempting to call API methods on a reader that’s offline results in a `terminal_reader_offline` error code:\n\nRefer to our [network requirements](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/network-requirements) to make sure a reader is correctly connected to the internet.\n\n### Missing webhooks ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nWhen a reader disconnects in the middle of a payment, it can’t update its action status in the API. In this scenario, the reader shows an error screen after a card is presented. However, the Reader object in the API doesn’t update to reflect the failure on the device, and you also don’t get reader action webhooks. A reader might be left with an action status of `in_progress` when this happens, and a cashier has to intervene by calling the [cancel\\_action](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/object#terminal_reader_object-action-cancel_action) endpoint to reset the reader state.\n\n### Delayed webhooks ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nOn rare occasions, if Stripe is having an outage, reader action webhooks might be late. You can query the status of the Reader or the PaymentIntent objects to know what their latest state is.\n\n[](#webhook-events)\n\n| Webhook | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `terminal.reader.action_succeeded` | Sent when an asynchronous action succeeds.

When using one of our Terminal SDKs, your point of sale device and the smart reader also communicate directly with each other over your local network.\n\nSmart readers have the following network requirements:\n\n*   Your network must support IPv4.\n    *   IPv6-only networks aren’t supported.\n    *   Some readers can connect to IPv6 networks through DHCP, but must also be assigned an IPv4 address. Changing advanced settings such as static IP, router, subnet mask, and DNS are not supported with IPv6.\n*   Terminal readers must be assigned a [private IP address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_network).\n*   Both the Terminal reader and your point of sale device must be able to connect to [Stripe’s infrastructure](https://docs.stripe.com/ips).\n*   If your Terminal readers support both WiFi and Ethernet, use one or the other, not both—attempting to use WiFi and Ethernet at the same time results in an unstable connection and intermittent downtime.\n    *   If you use WiFi, you can use a dock without connecting an Ethernet cable (for example, for charging or accessories only).\n*   WiFi networks must use WPA/WPA2/WPA3-Personal or WPA2/WPA3 EAP-PEAP Enterprise encryption, and must be password protected.\n    *   Verifone P400 readers only support WPA-Personal or WPA2-Personal encryption.\n*   Ethernet networks must support 10/100 Ethernet devices.\n*   If your network uses dynamic IP address assignment, your DHCP server configuration needs to allow Terminal readers to retain the same IP address for at least an entire workday.\n*   If your network limits the duration of network sessions (including idle sessions), the minimum session length for Terminal readers must be at least an entire workday.\n*   If you use one of our Terminal SDKs on a separate point of sale device (for example, not an app running on the Terminal reader itself), you must also meet the following requirements:\n    *   The reader must be on the same local network as your point of sale device.\n    *   The reader must be able to communicate directly with your point of sale device through your local network.\n    *   The DNS servers used by your point of sale device must be able to resolve internet-routable hostnames to local IP addresses.\n\n## Troubleshooting ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nWhen network-related issues occur, experienced personnel should be physically present to diagnose and correct problems.  Make sure you account for this when planning your Terminal integration, deployment, and maintenance.\n\n#### Note\n\nBecause of the large variety of network configurations and infrastructure, Stripe can only help with basic network questions. The operation and troubleshooting of your network is your responsibility.\n\nIf you encounter an issue, determine whether the cause is the network or something else.  You can rule out the network as the cause of an issue by temporarily moving one or more of your Terminal readers and point of sale devices to a different network and internet connection—then check to see if the same issue occurs there. Mobile hotspots work well for this kind of testing.\n\nIf the issue persists on a different network and Internet connection, perform additional testing and debugging of your integration’s code.  If you need help, [contact support](https://support.stripe.com/contact) and provide as much technical detail as possible (for example, error messages, logs, and so on).\n\nIf the issue only happens on your network, try the following:\n\n*   Make sure your network meets all of the requirements listed above, especially if anything about the network has changed recently.\n*   Check your firewall and other security configurations to make sure access to [Stripe’s infrastructure](https://docs.stripe.com/ips) isn’t being blocked.\n*   Try a different connection for both the Terminal reader and your point of sale device (for example, switch from WiFi to Ethernet).\n*   For WiFi, make sure all devices have good signal strength.\n*   For Ethernet, try using different network cables.\n*   Confirm smart readers have the expected IP and subnet assigned.\n*   If you’re using smart readers and our Terminal SDK on a separate point of sale device:\n    *   On your point of sale device, try resolving `10-42-42-42.test.device.stripe-terminal-local-reader.net` to an IP address. That hostname should resolve to the IP `10.42.42.42`. If it resolves to a different IP, or if DNS resolution fails, configure your point of sale device to use [Cloudflare DNS servers](https://1.1.1.1/dns/) (`1.1.1.1` and `1.0.0.1`) or [Google DNS servers](https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns) (`8.8.8.8` and `8.8.4.4`) and try again.\n    *   Check your router’s configuration to see if connections between wireless (WiFi) clients and wired (Ethernet) clients are being blocked.\n    *   Make sure you can ping the Terminal reader’s IP address from your point of sale device.",

To request access to the Collect Inputs beta for server-driven, JavaScript SDK, iOS SDK, Android SDK, or React Native email us at [stripe-terminal-betas@stripe.com](mailto:stripe-terminal-betas@stripe.com)\\]\n\n[](#collect-inputs)\n\nIn addition to collecting payments, Terminal smart readers allow you to display forms and collect information from customers. You make requests to the Stripe API, and the API communicates with the reader to display a prebuilt UI to collect customer input. Stripe notifies your backend of the customer’s responses using [webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks \"webhook\").\n\nTo collect inputs using Terminal’s smart readers, use the [collect\\_inputs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/collect_inputs) command. You can specify up to 5 inputs at a time, and the reader collects them in sequence. Stripe smart readers currently support six input types:\n\n*   The `selection` input type allows you to display up to 4 choices for a customer to select from.\n*   The `signature` input type allows you to collect a signature using the reader’s touchscreen.\n*   The `email` input type allows you to collect an email address from a customer.\n*   The `phone` input type allows you to collect a phone number from a customer.\n*   The `text` input type allows you to collect additional information from customers.\n*   The `numeric` input type allows you to collect additional information from customers.\n\n![Supported input types.](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/collect-inputs-form-types.9715c2bbc0105378c9c4a5e8e1c4eb59.png)\n\nSupported input types.\n\nYou can customize the appearance and behavior of all input types:\n\n*   Set important inputs as [required](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/collect_inputs#collect_inputs-inputs-required) to make sure they’re collected. For required inputs, the skip button is hidden.\n*   Provide context to your customer by specifying the text you want to display on the reader screen for each input using [custom\\_text](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/collect_inputs#collect_inputs-inputs-custom_text).\n*   Add up to 4 [toggles](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/collect_inputs#collect_inputs-inputs-toggles) that customers can enable or disable for boolean options, agreements, or opt-ins.\n\n![Toggles in email and selection form](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/collect-inputs-toggle.3183c0c14cc916374d588ba54ad34639.png)\n\nEmail and selection form with toggle\n\nAdditional customization is available for [selection](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/collect_inputs#collect_inputs-inputs-selection) inputs. When specifying the [choices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/collect_inputs#collect_inputs-inputs-selection-choices) you want to display to the customer, you can emphasize or de-emphasize choices using the [style](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/collect_inputs#collect_inputs-inputs-selection-choices-style) parameter.\n\n![Selection choice styles](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/collect-inputs-choice-style.dc4d2fcb98ee649a29bc43df806c114a.png)\n\nPrimary and secondary selection choice styles\n\nIn addition to the list of inputs, you might want to include [metadata](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/collect_inputs#collect_inputs-metadata) in your request. The request payload includes the specified metadata, which appears in both the synchronous response and the success or failure webhooks. By including a unique identifier such as a customer ID or order ID, you can more easily identify and handle the incoming webhook.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/terminal/readers/`\n\n`{{READER_ID}}`\n\n`/collect_inputs \\  -u \"  sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc  :\" \\  -H \"Stripe-Version: 2024-06-20; terminal_collect_inputs_beta=v1;\" \\   -d \"inputs[0][type]\"=signature \\  -d \"inputs[0][custom_text][title]\"=\"Rental Agreement\" \\  -d \"inputs[0][custom_text][description]\"=\"Please sign below to indicate that you agree to the rental agreement.\" \\  -d \"inputs[0][custom_text][submit_button]\"=Submit \\  -d \"inputs[0][required]\"=true \\  -d \"inputs[1][type]\"=selection \\  -d \"inputs[1][selection][choices][0][style]\"=primary \\  -d \"inputs[1][selection][choices][0][value]\"=Email \\  -d \"inputs[1][selection][choices][1][style]\"=primary \\  -d \"inputs[1][selection][choices][1][value]\"=Printed \\  -d \"inputs[1][selection][choices][2][style]\"=secondary \\  -d \"inputs[1][selection][choices][2][value]\"=\"No thanks\" \\  -d \"inputs[1][custom_text][title]\"=Receipt \\   --data-urlencode \"inputs[1][custom_text][description]\"=\"How would you like your receipt?\" \\  -d \"inputs[1][required]\"=true \\  -d \"inputs[2][type]\"=email \\  -d \"inputs[2][custom_text][title]\"=\"Enter your email\" \\   --data-urlencode \"inputs[2][custom_text][description]\"=\"We'll send updates on your order and occasional deals\" \\  -d \"inputs[2][required]\"=true \\  -d \"inputs[2][toggles][0][title]\"=\"Opt-in for marketing emails\" \\  -d \"inputs[2][toggles][0][default_value]\"=enabled \\  -d \"metadata[order_number]\"=12345`\n\n#### Beta\n\nYou must include the `terminal_collect_inputs_beta=v1` header to use the `collect_inputs` preview feature. The [reader](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/object) object won’t include the [collect\\_inputs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/object#terminal_reader_object-action-collect_inputs) object in API responses if you omit the header.\n\n#### Note\n\nDon’t use `collect_inputs` to collect sensitive data (including protected health information and customer payment card information), or any information restricted by law.\n\n[](#customer-interaction)\n\nWhen the reader begins collecting inputs, it displays the first input from the list you specified to the customer. The customer must make a selection or provide a signature to proceed with required inputs. However, for optional inputs, the customer has the option to skip to the next requested input.\n\nAfter the customer has either submitted or skipped all inputs, Stripe updates the reader object and sends out the `terminal.reader.action_succeeded` webhook.\n\n#### Note\n\nYou are fully responsible for being aware of, and complying with all applicable laws and regulations governing your use of this feature, and must in relation to such use, obtain, as applicable, all necessary consents, authorizations, licenses, rights, and permissions. If you use input collected by, or output displayed from a Terminal smart reader to enter into contracts with, or provide notices to your customers, you are fully responsible for ensuring the legal validity and enforceability of such contracts or notices.\n\n[](#receive-input-data)\n\nUse the curl command below as an example to create a webhook endpoint to receive the collected inputs.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/webhook_endpoints \\   -u` \n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`: \\   --header \"Stripe-Version: 2023-10-16; terminal_collect_inputs_beta=v1\" \\   --data-urlencode \"url\"=\"[https://example.com/webhook/endpoint](https://example.com/webhook/endpoint)\" \\   --data-urlencode \"api_version\"=\"2023-10-16;terminal_collect_inputs_beta=v1\" \\   --data-urlencode \"enabled_events[]\"=\"terminal.reader.action_succeeded\" \\   --data-urlencode \"enabled_events[]\"=\"terminal.reader.action_failed\"`\n\n#### Caution\n\nYou must create the webhook endpoint directly with Stripe’s [/v1/webhook\\_endpoints](https://docs.stripe.com/api/webhook_endpoints/create) API. The [collect\\_inputs object](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/object#terminal_reader_object-action-collect_inputs) doesn’t return complete results if you create the webhook endpoint with Stripe CLI or Stripe server-side SDKs. To make sure that the `collect_inputs` object is present in the webhook payload, include `terminal_collect_inputs_beta=v1` in the request header and set the `api_version` property when you [create the webhook endpoint](https://docs.stripe.com/api/webhook_endpoints/create).\n\nYou won’t be able to update an existing webhook to start listening to collected inputs, you must create a new one.\n\nWhen all inputs have been collected or skipped, Stripe sends a request to your webhook endpoint. The request payload is identical to the response when calling [collect\\_inputs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/collect_inputs), but adds a few additional parameters:\n\n*   The `value` parameter is populated for each collected input.\n    *   For signature type inputs, the [value](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/object#terminal_reader_object-action-collect_inputs-inputs-signature-value) is a [file ID](https://docs.stripe.com/api/files/object#file_object-id) that [retrieves](https://docs.stripe.com/api/files/retrieve) the signature image as an SVG.\n    *   For selection type inputs, the [value](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/object#terminal_reader_object-action-collect_inputs-inputs-selection-value) is the string of the selected choice’s `value`.\n    *   For phone, email, text, and numeric inputs, the value is the string of the customer’s response.\n*   If an optional input is skipped by the customer, the [skipped](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/object#terminal_reader_object-action-collect_inputs-inputs-skipped) parameter is set to `true`.\n*   The `value` of each toggle is populated with `enabled` or `disabled`.\n\nSubscribe to webhooks to receive collected inputs as soon as they’re available. You can [retrieve the reader](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/retrieve) with the `terminal_collect_inputs_beta=v1` request header as a backup if your backend fails to consume the webhook.\n\nStripe sends two webhooks to notify your backend of the reader’s status:\n\n*   `terminal.reader.action_succeeded`: Sent when a `collect_inputs` action succeeds.\n*   `terminal.reader.action_failed`: Sent when a `collect_inputs` action fails. This includes timeouts, which occur after the reader screen isn’t touched for 2 minutes.\n\n[](#download-signature-images)\n\nTo receive the collected signature image, [retrieve the file](https://docs.stripe.com/api/files/retrieve) and use your secret key to access its [URL](https://docs.stripe.com/api/files/object#file_object-url).\n\n#### Note\n\nStripe stores the signature images you collect for 7 days. If you need to use signature images more than 7 days after collecting them, download the file and store it. You are fully responsible for being aware of and complying with all laws that apply to your use, storage, and disclosure of your customers’ signatures.\n\n## Beta SDK![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nIf you use one of Stripe’s [server-side SDKs](https://docs.stripe.com/libraries), you must install a beta version. For installation instructions, refer to the relevant GitHub page for the server SDK you want to use.\n\nYou also need to configure your SDK’s API version to include the beta header mentioned above.

  "markdown": "# Rules reference | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Learn more about the structure of rules and the order in which Radar processes them.\n\nBefore creating a rule, you need to understand how they’re processed and what payment attributes you can use to set evaluation criteria. The Stripe machine-learning fraud systems can block many fraudulent payments for you, but you can also set up rules that are unique to your business using the [supported attributes](#supported-attributes).\n\n## Rule processing and ordering![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe action a rule takes determines the order in which it’s processed. [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar \"Radar\") evaluates each payment against the rules you create and rules have the following order of priority:\n\n1.  **Request 3DS**: Rules that when used with the [Payment Intents API](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents) or [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout), _request_ the issuer to do [3D Secure authentication](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure \"3D Secure (3DS)\") if supported. Radar evaluates these before any block, review, or allow rules.\n2.  **Allow**: Rules that _allow_ a payment to be processed. Payments that fall under allow rules aren’t evaluated against any block or review rules.\n3.  **Block**: Rules that _block_ a payment and reject it. Blocked payments aren’t evaluated against any review rules.\n4.  **Review**: Rules that allow payments to be processed but then place them in _review_.\n\nIf a payment matches the criteria for a rule, Radar takes the appropriate action and the payment isn’t evaluated any further. If a payment matches an allow rule, it’s processed normally–no block or review rules are subsequently evaluated, even if the payment would also meet their criteria. An example set of rules might be as follows:\n\n*   **Allow** payments less than `$10`\n*   **Allow** payments made within the US and with a risk level of `normal`\n*   **Block** payments where the risk level is `high`\n*   **Block** payments `greater than $1,000`\n*   **Review** payments made with a card issued `outside the US`\n\nUsing the rules above, all payments less than 10 USD would be processed, regardless of their risk level or where the card was issued. This is because the first rule allows the payment, so no further rules are evaluated. Similarly, a 1,500 payment USD made within the US with a normal risk level would also be allowed, despite the rule to block payments over 1,000 USD. This is because of the second rule in the list, allowing payments made within the US and a normal risk level. When a particular rule is triggered, no further rules are evaluated.\n\n## Rule structure![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe rule structure has two components—the _action_ it should take and the _condition_ to evaluate:\n\n`{action} if {condition}`\n\nTogether they are referred to as the _predicate_. In practice, a rule to block all payments over 1,000 USD would appear as:\n\n`Block if :amount_in_usd: > 1000.00`\n\n*   The _action_ is `Block`\n*   The _condition_ is `:amount_in_usd: > 1000.00`\n\n### Actions![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nA rule can perform one of four actions with a payment that meets its criteria, processed in this specific order.\n\n#### Request 3D Secure\n\nWhen used with the Payment Intents API, this rule determines if Stripe requests the issuer to attempt [3D Secure authentication](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure \"3D Secure (3DS)\"). Requesting 3DS alone doesn’t block all possible [3D Secure outcomes](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/rules#request-3d-secure). Whether or not there are matches on this rule, we evaluate rules for allow, block, and review afterward.\n\n#### Allow\n\nThis rule determines when to always allow a payment that meets certain criteria, regardless of Stripe’s evaluation or any other matching rules. When a payment matches the criteria in an allow rule, Stripe processes it normally and it’s not subject to further rules evaluation. Even if Stripe proceeds with a payment, the card issuer may still decline it.\n\n#### Block\n\nBlock rules specify that Stripe should always block a payment. If a payment matches the criteria in a block rule, Stripe rejects it and it’s not subject to further rules evaluation.\n\n#### Review\n\nYou might want to allow certain types of payments but also have the option to examine them more closely. With review rules, you can [place payments in review](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/reviews). This is especially useful for payments that don’t fit common patterns, such as larger payments or payments from a country that you don’t often ship to. Stripe still processes these payments and charges the customer, but you have an additional opportunity to review the order and check for signs of fraud.\n\n### Conditions![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nIf a payment matches a rule’s condition, the corresponding action is taken. A basic condition is, itself, made up of three parts:\n\n`[attribute] [operator] [value]`\n\n*   **Attribute**: The attribute of a payment (for example, the _amount_ or _type of card_)\n*   **Operator**: The arithmetic that compares the attribute to the value (for example, _greater than_ or _not equal to_)\n*   **Value**: The criteria you want to use (for example, `100.00` or `debit`)\n\nCombining both the action and condition together, the structure of a rule is:\n\n`{action} if {[attribute] [operator] [value]}`\n\nFour types of conditions exist, depending on the attribute type:\n\n*   `[string_attribute] [operator] [string_value]`\n*   `[country_attribute] [operator] [country_value]`\n*   `[numeric_attribute] [operator] [numeric_value]`\n*   `[boolean_attribute]`\n\nYou can also use certain attributes as a corresponding value within a condition. For instance, you can create a rule to block payments where the issuing country of the card doesn’t match with the country where the payment was made, using the following attribute and value:\n\n`Block if :card_country: != :ip_country:`\n\nFor a list of all possible conditions, refer to the [supported attributes](#supported-attributes).\n\n#### String attributes![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThese contain any combination of characters. String attributes and values most commonly represent a piece of text, such as a card’s brand (for example, `visa`, `amex`) or risk level (for example, `elevated`). You can use these in rules to allow payments only from a particular country, or block payments made with prepaid cards.\n\n#### Metadata attributes![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThese attributes are derived from the [metadata you’ve attached to your payments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/charges-api#storing-information-in-metadata). Metadata attributes can operate as either strings or numbers. When used as strings, metadata attributes are _case-sensitive_.\n\nYou can use these attributes when creating Stripe Radar rules, enabling you to write rules against any custom business attributes you have passed to Stripe in the metadata field attached to your payments.\n\nMetadata attributes are written in the following structure:\n\n`::[metadata attribute name]:: [operator] [metadata_value]`\n\nFor example, suppose we have payments with the following key-value data stored in the metadata field:\n\n| **Metadata Name** | **Metadata Value** |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Customer Age** | 22  |\n| **Item ID** | 5A381D |\n| **Category ID** | groceries |\n\nYou can write a rule to place payments that match the following criteria into review.\n\n`Review if ::Customer Age:: < 30`\n\nYou can also write rules using both metadata attributes and other [supported attributes](#supported-attributes) mentioned in this document. For example, you can write a rule that only places a payment in review if the `Item ID` matches `5A381D` and the payment amount exceeds 1,000 USD.\n\n``Review if ::Item ID:: = `'5A381D'` and :amount_in_usd: > 1000``\n\nMetadata attributes also support the `IN` operator to match against multiple values. For example, you can write a rule that places a payment in review if the `Category ID` is one of groceries, electronics, or clothing.\n\n``Review if ::Category ID:: IN (`'groceries'`, `'electronics'`, `'clothing'`)``\n\nYou can use the `INCLUDES` operator with rules for metadata attributes and other string attributes to match substrings. For example, you can write a rule that places a payment in review if the `Item ID` includes the string `A381`. This matches A381, 5A381D, A381D, 5A381, and so on.\n\n`` Review if ::Item ID:: INCLUDES `'A381'` ``\n\n#### Caution\n\nMetadata attributes are case-sensitive when used as strings. Make sure that metadata values you specify in rules are exactly the same as the ones attached to your payments.\n\n**Metadata on Customer and Destination Objects**\n\nYou can also access metadata on customer and destination objects (if those are used for a given payment). These attributes use the following structure:\n\n`::[customer|destination]:[metadata attribute name]:: [operator] [metadata_value]`\n\nFor example, suppose you had a customer with the following metadata:\n\n| **Metadata Name** | **Metadata Value** |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Trusted** | true |\n\nYou could write a rule that always allows payments if the customer’s `Trusted` metadata field is `true`.\n\n`` Allow if ::customer:Trusted:: = `'true'` ``\n\nOr if you had a destination with the following metadata:\n\n| **Metadata Name** | **Metadata Value** |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Category** | new |\n\nYou could write a rule that places a payment in review if the destination’s `Category` metadata field is `new`.\n\n`` Review if ::destination:Category:: = `'new'` ``\n\n#### Country attributes![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThese use [two-letter country codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2) to represent a country, such as `US` for United States, `GB` for Great Britain, or `AR` for Argentina. Country attributes operate the same as string attributes, the only difference being that the value must be a country code.\n\n#### State attributes![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThese use [ISO codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2) to represent the state or principal subdivision of a country, such as `CA` to represent California of the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2:US), `ENG` to represent England which is part of [Great Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2:GB), or `L` to represent La Pampa which is part of [Argentina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2:AR). We omit the two-letter country code from the state ISO code, so if you want to block transactions from California, your rule would compare the state attribute to `CA`.\n\n`` Block if :ip_state: = `'CA'` ``\n\nState attributes operate the same as string attributes, the only difference being that the value must be an ISO code.\n\n#### Numeric attributes![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nAs these contain only numbers, they support more operators than string attributes and values. A payment’s _amount_ is one example of a numeric attribute. You can create a rule to perform an action if the amount is higher, lower, equal, or not equal to the amount you specify.\n\nFor numeric attributes that are counts over time windows, the count excludes the payment that you’re currently processing. For example, `total_charges_per_customer_hourly` represents the number of previous charge attempts from a given customer in the preceding hour. So, for the first charge attempt in a given hour for a customer, `total_charges_per_customer_hourly` has a value of `0`. For a second charge attempt within the same hour, it has a value of `1`, and so on.\n\nTime-since-first-seen attributes also don’t take into account the payment you’re currently processing. For example, a payment without an email has a missing value for `seconds_since_email_first_seen`. So do payments with emails never seen before on your account (since we don’t include the payment currently being processed, this is effectively the same behavior as the first example). See below for more details about [missing values](#missing-attributes). The `seconds_since_email_first_seen` field is only non-null after a new payment with a given email is processed.\n\n#### Bounded numeric attributes![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nBounded numeric attributes are similar to the numeric attributes described above. For example, they exclude the payment that you’re currently processing. The difference is that the available values for bounded numeric attributes are capped (or _bounded_) at a specific value.\n\nAs an example, take `authorized_charges_per_email_hourly` which represents the number of previous charges that were authorized for the email in the past hour on your account. For the sake of the example, let’s say it has a bound of `5`. For the first charge attempt in the past hour with the email `jenny.rosen@example.com` the counter has a value of `0`. Subsequent charge attempts in the same hour see higher counter values. After authorizing the 6th charge within the hour from `jenny.rosen@example.com`, the counter stops incrementing and stays at `5` despite actually having `6` charge attempts in the past hour.\n\nIf an attempt to increment the counter above the cap occurs, we exclude older values from consideration and replace them with newer values. For example, consider a counter with a cap of `3` that’s been filled up with 3 charges. One way to visualize the counter is by maintaining a list of timestamps representing arrival times of charges: `[10, 20, 30]` for instance. When a charge arrives at time `50`, the counter now looks like `[20, 30, 50]`.\n\n#### Boolean attributes![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nA Boolean attribute represents whether a particular attribute is true. Unlike string and numeric attributes, Boolean attributes have no operators or values. You can use a Boolean attribute to block payments that have been made with a disposable email address, or place payments in review that were made with an anonymous IP address.\n\nA post-authorization attribute (for example, `:cvc_check:`, `:address_zip_check:`, or `:address_line1_check:`) requires Stripe to exchange data with card issuers as part of the authorization process. The card issuer verifies this data against the information they have on file for the cardholder and checks for a match. Rules that use post-authorization attributes execute after rules that don’t use post-authorization attributes. (This won’t affect whether a charge is blocked or not, but may impact which rule blocks the charge.)\n\nIf you use a post-authorization attribute in a rule, your customer’s statement may temporarily show an authorization even if the charge is ultimately blocked—the authorization generally disappears after a few days.\n\nAddress ([AVS](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/prevention/verification \"Address verification System (AVS)\")) and [CVC](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/prevention/verification \"Card verification code check (CVC)\") attributes have five possible values:\n\n| **Attribute value** | **Explanation** |\n| --- | --- |\n| `pass` | The data provided is correct. |\n| `fail` | The data provided is incorrect. |\n| `unavailable` | The customer’s card issuer won’t check the data provided. Not all card issuers or countries support address verification. |\n| `unchecked` | The data was provided but hasn’t been checked yet. The customer’s card issuer will eventually check the data provided. |\n| `not_provided` | The data wasn’t provided to Stripe. |\n\nSome example rules:\n\n*   `` Block if :address_line1_check: = `'fail'` ``\n*   `` Block if :cvc_check: != `'pass'` ``\n*   ``Block if :address_zip_check: in (`'fail'`, `'not_provided'`)``\n\nRequiring a strict `pass` on rules can be overly restrictive. For example, [wallets](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods \"digital wallet\") usually don’t provide a CVC because they store tokenized card information. Therefore [CVC](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/prevention/verification \"Card verification code check (CVC)\") checks, like [3D-Secure](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure \"3D Secure (3DS)\") checks, aren’t available for payment methods such as Apple Pay. Stripe recommends using Radar’s [Built-in rules](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/rules#built-in-rules), which consider these edge cases.\n\n#### Supported attributes![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nRefer to the list of all [supported attributes](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/rules/supported-attributes) for a complete list of attributes you can apply to your rule definitions.\n\n#### Converted amounts![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nWhen using `amount_in_xyz`, Stripe automatically determines the converted amount of any payment when checking if the amount matches your chosen criteria. For example, if you create a rule using `amount_in_usd` to block all payments greater than 1,000 USD, Stripe would block a payment of a lower nominal amount in a different currency (for example, 900 GBP) if its equivalent converted value exceeds 1,000 USD.\n\n#### “Takes into account payments from 2020 onwards” in practice![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe descriptions of some rule attributes include the phrase “takes into account payments from 2020 onwards”. This means that the rule would treat a card that last transacted with your business in 2019 the same as a card that’s new to your business. You should carefully consider what this means in the context of your business and rules as it could result in counterintuitive behavior. For example, if you create a rule to block high-value payments from new cards, you might end up blocking a good customer who hasn’t made a purchase since 2019.\n\n#### “This attribute only includes live mode Customer objects that interacted with your account in the past <week, year>. This data updates at most every 72 hours.” in practice![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe descriptions of some rule attributes include the sentences “This attribute only includes live mode Customer objects that interacted with your account in the past <week, year>. This data updates at most every 72 hours.” This means that live mode Customer objects that were created, charged, or updated on your account in the past week or year are included in these counts. However, the count doesn’t update immediately and might take up to 72 hours to propagate through the system, though often times these counters update sooner than 72 hours.\n\n### Operators![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nA condition’s operator denotes the comparison between the payment’s attribute and the value you provide. Different operators are available, depending on the type of attribute being used.\n\n| Operator | String | Metadata | Country | State | Numeric | Description | Example |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **\\=** | ✔︎  | ✔︎  | ✔︎  | ✔︎  | ✔︎  | Equal to | `` :card_country: = `'us'` `` |\n| **!=** | ✔︎  | ✔︎  | ✔︎  | ✔︎  | ✔︎  | Not equal to | `` :card_funding: != `'prepaid'` `` |\n| **<** |     |     |     |     | ✔︎  | Less than | `:amount_in_gbp: < 10.00` |\n| **\\>** |     |     |     |     | ✔︎  | Greater than | `:amount_in_usd: > 500.00` |\n| **<=** |     | ︎   |     |     | ✔︎  | Less than or equal to | `:amount_in_eur: <= 100.00` |\n| **\\>=** |     |     |     |     | ✔︎  | Greater than or equal to | `:amount_in_cad: >= 10.00` |\n| **IN** | ✔   | ✔︎  | ✔   | ✔︎  | ✔︎  | Is in the group | ``:card_country: IN (`'gb'`, `'ie'`)`` |\n| **INCLUDES** | ✔   | ✔︎  | ✔   | ✔   |     | Contains the string | `` :ip_address: INCLUDES `'192.168'` `` |\n| **LIKE** | ✔   | ✔︎  | ✔   | ✔   |     | Matches the given pattern. Use the wildcard character `%` to match zero or any number of letters, digits or symbols. | `` :email: LIKE `'fraud%@stripe.com'` `` |\n\n### Lists ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nYou can reference a group of values in your rules through [lists](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/lists). All list aliases referenced in rules must start with `@`. To construct a rule referencing a list, follow the structure:\n\n`{action} [attribute] in [list]`\n\nFor example, say you have a list of card countries you’d like to block. You could write a rule using several `OR` clauses:\n\n`` Block if :card_country: = `'CA'` OR :card_country: = `'DE'` OR :card_country: = `'AE'` ``\n\nYou could also write a rule using an inline list:\n\n``Block if :card_country: IN (`'CA'`, `'DE'`, `'AE'`)``\n\nYou could also create a list of card countries you want to block, named `card_countries_to_block`. You can then [add](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/lists#custom-lists) the countries of your choice to the list and reference that list in a rule:\n\n`Block if :card_country: in @card_countries_to_block`\n\nReferencing a list in a rule allows you to edit a large number of items in one place instead of maintaining many individual rules.\n\n#### Caution\n\nEU merchants should be aware of the Geo-blocking Regulation and its prohibitions on blocking payments from customers based in EU member states. [Learn more about this regulation](https://support.stripe.com/questions/eu-geo-blocking-regulation-changes).\n\n### Missing attributes ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nTypical rule conditions refer to attributes set on every payment, such as `:card_country:` (which is set on every card-based charge) or a metadata attribute you always send with your payment requests. In some scenarios an attribute might be missing, for example:\n\n*   You have different checkout flows on your site, and some of them don’t collect customers’ email addresses\n    \n*   You’ve only recently started using Stripe.js, and so `:ip_country:` is available on new payments, but not available on historical payments (which we search when previewing rules)\n    \n*   For some of your payments, a bug in your integration fails to set an expected metadata key\n    \n\n#### How rule conditions evaluate missing attributes![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nConsider the rule `` Block if :email_domain: = `'definitelyfraud.com'` ``. If you didn’t collect the customer’s email address, the `:email_domain:` attribute would be missing, and—as you might expect—the rule condition would not match the payment.\n\nNow consider the rule `` Review if :email_domain: != `'definitelysafe.com'` ``. If the `:email_domain:` attribute is missing, this rule _also_ doesn’t match the payment. This result might seem a bit surprising, as a missing value is not the same as `` `'definitelysafe.com'` ``. In this case, we interpret `` != `'definitelysafe.com'` `` to mean “the attribute has some value other than `` `'definitelysafe.com'` ``,” which a missing attribute doesn’t satisfy.\n\nMore generally: any comparison (for example, `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`) of a missing feature against another static value or feature (missing or present) always returns false.\n\n#### Explicit handling with the `is_missing` function![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nIf you want to explicitly check for the existence of an attribute or metadata attribute, use the `is_missing` function. Provide this function with the attribute or metadata key that may be missing.\n\nFor example, you could write a rule to match all payments where you don’t have access to a customer’s email address:\n\n*   `Review if is_missing(:email_domain:)`\n\nOr you might write a rule to match all payments that have a certain metadata attribute set:\n\n*   `Review if !(is_missing(::foo::))`\n\nYou can also use the `is_missing` function in `OR` or `AND` conjunctions:\n\n*   ``Review if is_missing(:email_domain:) OR :email_domain: IN (`'yopmail.net'`, `'yandex.ru'`)``\n\n### Complex conditions ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nYou can build complex conditions by joining together basic conditions using the operators **AND**, **OR**, and **NOT**. You can also use their symbolic equivalents: **&&**, **||**, and **!** respectively.\n\nSimilar to programming languages such as C, Python, and SQL, Stripe supports standard operator _precedence_ (order of operations). For instance, the complex condition:\n\n`{condition_X} OR NOT {condition_Y} AND {condition_Z}`\n\nis interpreted as:\n\n`{condition_X} OR ((NOT {condition_Y}) AND {condition_Z})`\n\nSub-conditional grouping within complex conditions is also supported using parentheses. For instance, you can amend the prior example to explicitly change the evaluation order of sub-predicates:\n\n`({condition_X} OR (NOT {condition_Y})) AND {condition_Z}`\n\n`{condition_X} OR NOT ({condition_Y} AND {condition_Z})`\n\nBy using parentheses in different locations, each of these complex conditions lead to different results.\n\n### Valid conditions![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe following conditions are examples of correct use of attributes and a supported operator:\n\n*   `` :card_brand: = `'amex'` ``\n*   `` :card_country: != `'US'` ``\n*   `:amount_in_usd: >= 1000.00`\n*   `:is_anonymous_ip:`\n\n### Invalid conditions![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nWhen creating a rule, Radar provides feedback if you attempt to use an invalid condition. For reference, the following are examples of invalid conditions, where the value for an attribute or the operator used isn’t supported:\n\n*   `` :risk_level: < `'highest'` `` (string values can only make use of = or != operators)\n*   `` :ip_country: = `'Canada'` `` (country values must be expressed in two-letter short code)\n*   `` :amount_in_usd: >= `'one thousand dollars'` `` (numeric values must be expressed in numbers)\n*   `` :is_anonymous_ip: = `'true'` `` (Boolean attributes are not used with operators or values)\n\n### Velocity rules![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nMany [supported attributes](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/rules/supported-attributes) include invariants for different time scales (for example, the `daily` in `total_charges_per_email_daily`). These are called velocity rules.\n\nAttributes are calculated as a rolling window, based on fixed seconds and not on a calendar. For example, `daily` means that the time between two charges in a rule attribute must be a maximum of 24 hours or 86400 seconds apart to match.\n\nThe attributes are defined as:\n\n*   `hourly` is 3600 seconds\n*   `daily` is 86400 seconds\n*   `weekly` is 604800 seconds\n*   `yearly` is 31536000 seconds\n\nA common use case for these attributes is to reduce [card testing](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/prevention/card-testing#prevent-card-testing) or enumeration attack scenarios, as explained in the [Radar 101 guide](https://stripe.com/guides/radar-rules-101#rules-that-help-prevent-card-testing-or-card-cashing).\n\n## See also![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n*   [3DS Rule Examples](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/rules#request-3d-secure)\n*   [Continuous Fraud Management Guide](https://stripe.com/guides/improve-fraud-management-with-radar-for-fraud-teams-and-stripe-data)\n*   [Query Disputes and Fraud Data](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-data/query-disputes-and-fraud-data)\n*   [Radar 101 Guide](https://stripe.com/guides/radar-rules-101)\n*   [Rules Overview](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/rules)\n*   [Supported Attributes](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/rules/supported-attributes)",

  "markdown": "# Save cards for online payments\n\nYou’re responsible for your compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, and network rules when saving a customer’s payment details. For example, the European Data Protection Board has issued guidance regarding saving payment details. These requirements generally apply if you want to save your customer’s payment method for future use, such as presenting a customer’s payment method to them in the checkout flow for a future purchase or charging them when they’re not actively using your website or app.\n\nAdd terms to your website or app that state how you plan to save payment method details and allow customers to opt in. If you plan to charge the customer while they’re offline, then at a minimum, make sure that your terms also cover the following:\n\n*   The customer’s agreement to your initiating a payment or a series of payments on their behalf for specified transactions.\n*   The anticipated timing and frequency of payments (for instance, whether charges are for scheduled installment or subscription payments, or for unscheduled top-ups).\n*   How the payment amount is determined.\n*   Your cancellation policy, if you’re setting up the payment method for a subscription service.\n\nMake sure you keep a record of your customer’s written agreement to these terms.\n\nWhen you save a payment method, it can only be used for the specific usage that you included in your terms. If you want to charge customers when they’re offline and also save the customer’s payment method to present to them as a saved payment method for future purchases, you must explicitly collect consent from the customer. One way to do so is with a “Save my payment method for future use” checkbox.",

  "markdown": "# Deployment checklist | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Use this checklist to help ensure a smooth deployment of Stripe Terminal.\n\nStripe Terminal requires integrating hardware and software to bring Stripe to the physical world. As you develop your integration, refer to this checklist to make sure you cover all the critical steps.\n\nIt’s fine to go out of order, but understanding the full scope of a Terminal integration helps you connect all the pieces.\n\nAfter following the integration guides for Stripe Terminal, check that your application is set up correctly.\n\n*   Set up the ConnectionToken endpoint correctly\n    \n    To handle the ConnectionToken lifecycle, set up an endpoint on your backend that creates a ConnectionToken for your client application. Authenticate this endpoint to control who can access your readers. Don’t hard-code the ConnectionToken in your application—it prevents you from reconnecting to a reader. To further control access to smart readers like the [Verifone P400](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/connect-reader?reader-type=smart) and [BBPOS WisePOS E](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/connect-reader?reader-type=smart), use [Locations](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/fleet/locations-and-zones).\n    \n*   If you defined the PaymentIntent [`capture_method`](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-capture_method) as `manual`, the payment is authorized but not captured when the SDK returns a processed PaymentIntent to your application. To complete collection of funds, you must [capture the PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/collect-card-payment#capture-payment).\n    \n    When your application receives a processed PaymentIntent from the SDK, make sure it notifies your backend to capture the PaymentIntent.\n    \n*   Make sure you can provide receipts to customers\n    \n    Provide your customer with the option to receive a paper or email receipt. You can use Stripe’s prebuilt receipts, or use receipt data from the Stripe API to build custom receipts that are on-brand for your business. Test that you receive a receipt when you create a live mode payment using your application.\n    \n    If you provide your customers with [custom receipts](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/features/receipts#custom), save a copy of each receipt as dispute evidence. If you use Stripe’s prebuilt receipts, a copy of the receipt is saved automatically and available in the Dashboard.\n    \n*   Set up a process to reconcile payments with your internal orders system\n    \n    [Reconcile payments](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/collect-card-payment#reconciling) with your internal orders system on your server at the end of a day’s activity to avoid unintended authorizations or un-captured funds:\n    \n    *   A user abandoning your application’s checkout flow early can result in an un-captured PaymentIntent, which may appear to the cardholder as an unintended authorization.\n    *   Similarly, the request from your application notifying your backend to capture the PaymentIntent may fail, resulting in incomplete collection of funds.\n*   Support updates for the BBPOS Chipper 2X BT\n    \n    The [BBPOS Chipper 2X BT](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/readers/bbpos-chipper2xbt) does not auto-update, so it’s important for your application to support updates. Although they’re rare, updates usually contain important features or critical fixes. Make sure your app supports the following:\n    \n    1.  First, check for whether an update is available.\n    2.  If an update is available, display in the UI the estimated time to complete the update, along with options to continue or cancel.\n    3.  While the update is in progress, have the UI tell the user to leave the reader powered on and nearby. Block the user from navigating away from the page.\n    4.  Display a visual indicator of the update progress (for example, the percentage or a progress bar).\n    \n    Refer to our example applications ([iOS](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-terminal-ios), [Android](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-terminal-android)) for a reference UI.\n    \n*   Support registering readers in the field\n    \n    For smart readers like the [Verifone P400](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/readers/verifone-p400) and [BBPOS WisePOS E](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/readers/bbpos-wisepos-e), you must [register the reader](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/fleet/register-readers) to your account before you can connect your application to the reader.\n    \n    How you handle reader registration depends on your use case:\n    \n    *   **Deployment size**: For smaller deployments, [register each reader](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/fleet/register-readers) in the Stripe Dashboard. For larger deployments that require shipping readers to various locations, make sure site managers can add new readers to your company’s Stripe account. Build a workflow into your application to let others register readers to your Stripe account. The endpoint for [registering a reader](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/create) must be called server side. If you support registering readers from your client application, the app must communicate with your backend to register the reader.\n        \n    *   **Using Connect**: If you use Connect [direct charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges), use the `Stripe-Account` header to register the reader to the connected account. With [destination charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges), register new readers [to the platform account](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/features/connect).\n        \n*   Use Locations to group your readers\n    \n    Create a Terminal [Location](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/locations/create) object for each physical operating site at which your business accepts in-person payments. You must register each reader to a location to ensure that it downloads the proper regional configuration.\n    \n    For smart readers, support specifying a location while [registering the reader](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/fleet/register-readers#smart-readers). For Bluetooth readers, support specifying a location while [connecting to the reader](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/fleet/register-readers#bluetooth-readers).\n    \n*   Support discovering multiple readers and provide helpful UI\n    \n    Make sure your application can display an updating list of discovered readers, with the label and/or serial number of each. Refer to our [example applications](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/example-applications) for a sample UI.\n    \n    If you expect your mobile app to be used with multiple Bluetooth readers, use the [Bluetooth Proximity](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/connect-reader?terminal-sdk-platform=ios&reader-type=bluetooth#bluetooth-proximity) discovery method. Include in your app instructions to hold the reader close to the app device, and wait for it to begin flashing multiple colors. Make sure your app’s UI allows canceling the reader discovery process.\n    \n    If you use the [Verifone P400](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/readers/verifone-p400) or [BBPOS WisePOS E](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/readers/bbpos-wisepos-e), check that the reader and the device running your application are both on the correct LAN. Include in your application instructions for verifying the correct LAN.\n    \n*   Make sure you’re on the latest release of the SDK\n    \n    Stripe periodically releases updates which can include new functionality, bug fixes, and security updates. Update your SDK as soon as a new version is available. The currently available SDKs are:\n    \n    *   [Stripe Terminal Android SDK](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-terminal-android/releases)\n    *   [Stripe Terminal iOS SDK](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-terminal-ios/releases)\n    *   [Stripe Terminal JavaScript SDK](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/references/api/js-sdk#changelog)\n    *   [Stripe Terminal React Native SDK](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-terminal-react-native)\n\nThe BBPOS and Chipper™ name and logo are trademarks or registered trademarks of BBPOS Limited in the United States and/or other countries.

  "markdown": "# Test Stripe Terminal | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Learn how to effectively test your Terminal integration.\n\n#### Note\n\nMuch of the process for testing Stripe Terminal is similar to that for testing online Stripe payments. Also, you can’t use Stripe Terminal with mobile wallets (for example, Apple Pay or Google Pay) in testmode. For more information, see the [general Stripe testing guide](https://docs.stripe.com/testing).\n\nThe best way to achieve a successful Terminal deployment is to test every part of your integration. We provide testing tools for each stage:\n\n1.  Before ordering a reader, test your integration with the reader simulator.\n2.  Test your complete hardware integration with a physical test card.\n\n## Simulated reader ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nStripe Terminal SDKs and server-driven integration come with a built-in simulated card reader, so you can develop and test your app without connecting to physical hardware. Whether your integration is complete or you’re still building it, use the simulated reader to emulate all the Terminal flows in your app.\n\nNote that the simulated reader does not provide a UI. After connecting to it in your app, you can see it working when calls to the Stripe SDK or API succeed.\n\nSimulated readers for SDKs automatically simulate card presentment as needed. For the server-driven integration, update your integration to [simulate card presentment](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/references/testing#simulated-card-presentment).\n\n## Simulated test cards![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe simulated reader can be configured to use a simulated test card, enabling you to test different flows within your point of sale application.\n\nBefore collecting a payment method, configure the simulated reader to use one of the following test card numbers or test payment methods to produce specific responses.\n\n### Standard test cards![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n| Test Card Number | Test Payment Method | Brand |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|     | `visa` | Visa |\n|     | `visa_debit` | Visa (debit) |\n|     | `mastercard` | Mastercard |\n|     | `mastercard_debit` | Mastercard (debit) |\n|     | `mastercard_prepaid` | Mastercard (prepaid) |\n|     | `amex` | American Express |\n|     | `amex2` | American Express |\n|     | `discover` | Discover |\n|     | `discover2` | Discover |\n|     | `diners` | Diners Club |\n|     | `diners_14digits` | Diners Club (14 digit card) |\n|     | `jcb` | JCB |\n|     | `unionpay` | UnionPay |\n|     | `interac` | Interac |\n|     | `eftpos_au_debit` | eftpos Australia |\n|     | `eftpos_au_visa_debit` | eftpos Australia/Visa |\n|     | `eftpos_au_mastercard_debit` | eftpos Australia/Mastercard |\n\n### Test cards for specific success cases![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n| Test Card Number | Test Payment Method | Result |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|     | `offline_pin_cvm` | Simulates the cardholder being prompted for and entering an offline PIN.

Note that because refund failures are asynchronous, the refund will appear to be successful at first and will only have the `failed` status on subsequent fetches. We also notify you of refund failures using the `charge.refund.updated` [webhook](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-charge.refund.updated) event. This simulated error is only supported in the JavaScript SDK. |\n\n#### Note\n\n## Physical test cards ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nTest payments with your Stripe Terminal reader using a physical test card. You can purchase readers and physical test cards from the Terminal tab of the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/terminal/shop).\n\nThis physical test card supports both chip entry and contactless payments. It only works with Stripe’s pre-certified readers, and only against the Stripe API in test mode. If you attempt to use your physical test card in live mode, the Stripe API returns an error. Unless stated otherwise, use the PIN `1234` when prompted.\n\nWhen creating payments using a physical test card, use amounts ending in the following values to produce specific responses:\n\n| Decimal | Result |\n| --- | --- |\n| **00** | Payment is approved. |\n| **01** | Payment is declined with a `call_issuer` code. |\n| **02** | When using readers featuring a cardholder-facing screen, insert the test card (if you’re outside the US you can also tap the card) and follow the on-screen prompts to complete the transaction. If a PIN is required, enter `1234`. The payment might decline with an `offline_pin_required` code if the card requires a PIN and the reader doesn’t have a cardholder-facing screen. |\n| **03** | When using readers featuring a cardholder-facing screen, insert the test card (if you’re outside the US you can also tap the card) and follow the on-screen prompts to complete the transaction. If a PIN is required, enter any 4-digit PIN. The payment might decline with an `online_or_offline_pin_required` code if the card requires a PIN and the reader doesn’t have a cardholder-facing screen. |\n| **05** | Payment is declined with an `generic_decline` code. |\n| **55** | Payment is declined with an `incorrect_pin` code. |\n| **60** | Payment is declined with an `online_or_offline_pin_required` code. |\n| **65** | Payment is declined with an `withdrawal_count_limit_exceeded` code. |\n| **75** | Payment is declined with an `pin_try_exceeded` code. |\n\nFor example, a payment processed using a physical test card for the amount **$25.00** succeeds; a payment processed for the amount **$10.05** is declined.\n\n### Interac test cards Canada only ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nTo test your Interac integration, you can use the simulated `interac` test card or an _Interac physical test card_. This can be ordered on the [Terminal hardware shop](https://dashboard.stripe.com/terminal/shop) in the Dashboard. The Stripe-branded physical test card can’t be used as an Interac card.\n\nThe Interac test card works for both `interac_present` payments and `interac_present` refunds. You can use the same [test amounts](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/references/testing#physical-test-cards) you use for testing `card_present` payments. Unless stated otherwise, use the PIN `1234` when prompted. To test a declined refund, create a partial refund with an amount ending with the following decimal values: `01`, `05`, `55`, `65`, or `75`.\n\n#### Note\n\nThe Interac test card doesn’t support contactless payments.\n\n### eftpos test cards Australia only ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nTo test your eftpos integration, you can use the simulated `eftpos` test card or an _eftpos physical test card_. This can be ordered on the [Terminal hardware shop](https://dashboard.stripe.com/terminal/shop) in the Dashboard. The Stripe-branded physical test card can’t be used as an `eftpos` card.\n\nYou can use the same [test amounts](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/references/testing#physical-test-cards) you use for testing `card_present` payments. Unless stated otherwise, use the PIN `1234` when prompted.\n\n## Simulated card presentment ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nWhen using the server-driven integration, use the [present\\_payment\\_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/present_payment_method) endpoint to simulate a cardholder tapping or inserting their card on the reader.\n\n`curl -X POST https://api.stripe.com/v1/test_helpers/terminal/readers/tmr_xxx/present_payment_method \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\"`\n\n`{   \"id\": \"tmr_xxx\",   \"object\": \"terminal.reader\",   \"action\": {     \"failure_code\": null,     \"failure_message\": null,     \"process_payment_intent\": {       \"payment_intent\": \"pi_xxx\"     },     \"status\": \"succeeded\",     \"type\": \"process_payment_intent\"   },   … }`\n\nIf you don’t specify parameters, the simulated payment defaults to a valid [test card](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/references/testing#standard-test-cards) based on the payment method type of the PaymentIntent. Below are the default test cards for Terminal payment method types:\n\n| Payment Method Type | Test Card Number | Test Payment Method |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `card_present` |     | `visa` |\n| `card_present` and `interac_present` |     | `visa` |\n| `interac_present` |     | `interac` |\n\nWith the [standard test cards](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/references/testing#standard-test-cards), you can also use [test amounts](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/references/testing#physical-test-cards) to simulate failure scenarios\n\n## Simulated reader updates ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nDuring connection to a simulated Bluetooth reader, you can configure a simulated reader update.\n\nSet the `Terminal.shared.simulatorConfiguration.availableReaderUpdate` to any of the following configurations. Calling `connectBluetoothReader` triggers a simulated reader update.\n\n| Update Configuration | Result |\n| --- | --- |\n| `SimulateReaderUpdateNone` | No update, no need to communicate anything to your user. |\n| `SimulateReaderUpdateRequired` | A required update is available and takes 1 minute. Your `BluetoothReaderDelegate` receives the `didStartInstallingUpdate` callback. |\n| `SimulateReaderUpdateAvailable` | An optional update is available. Communicate to the user that an update is available and highlight the `requiredAt` date. |\n| `SimulateReaderUpdateLowBattery` | A required update starts to install but fails due to the reader running low on battery. Connecting to the reader also fails. This simulates the reader running an older version of software. |\n| `SimulateReaderUpdateLowBatterySucceedConnect` | A required update starts to install but fails due to the reader running low on battery. Connecting to the reader succeeds. This simulates the reader running a recent version of software that is still acceptable. Installing the update is retried when connecting to the reader again. |\n| `SimulateReaderUpdateRandom` | A random selection of the above scenarios. |",

The object you pass in will drive the contents displayed on the reader’s screen.\n\nThe amounts passed to the `setReaderDisplay` method are only used for display purposes. The reader won’t automatically calculate tax or the total—your application must calculate the tax and total before displaying the values. You can use the [Stripe Tax API](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/custom#calculate-tax) to calculate taxes. Similarly, the total passed to `setReaderDisplay` doesn’t control the amount charged to the customer. Make sure the amount displayed on the reader matches the amount you’re charging your customer.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/terminal/readers/tmr_xxx/set_reader_display \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d type=cart \\  -d \"cart[line_items][0][description]\"=\"Caramel latte\" \\  -d \"cart[line_items][0][amount]\"=659 \\  -d \"cart[line_items][0][quantity]\"=1 \\  -d \"cart[line_items][1][description]\"=\"Dozen donuts\" \\  -d \"cart[line_items][1][amount]\"=1239 \\  -d \"cart[line_items][1][quantity]\"=1 \\  -d \"cart[currency]\"=usd \\  -d \"cart[tax]\"=100 \\  -d \"cart[total]\"=1998`\n\nTo clear reader display on the server-driven integration, call the [cancel\\_action](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/cancel_action) endpoint.\n\n## Pre-dip a card![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n#### Note\n\nPre-dipping a card is only supported for payments in the US.\n\nThe [Verifone P400](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/readers/verifone-p400), [BBPOS WisePOS E](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/readers/bbpos-wisepos-e), and [Stripe Reader S700](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/readers/stripe-reader-s700) support the ability to present a card to the reader before the transaction amount is finalized.\n\nThis option—known as _pre-dip_, _pre-tap_, or _pre-swipe_—can help speed up transaction times by allowing a customer to present a payment method before the end of the transaction.\n\nThe `setReaderDisplay` method prepares the reader for pre-dipping. Your customer can present a payment method at any point after this method is called. You can call `setReaderDisplay` multiple times to update the information displayed without impacting the pre-dipping process. Updating the display doesn’t invalidate a pre-dip, if one has already occurred.\n\nPre-dipping only allows your customer to present a card early in the payment process, it doesn’t move the payment process forward. Your integration can’t tell if pre-dipping has occurred, and you must implement the full payment flow for all transactions, regardless of pre-dipping.\n\n## Pre-dip disabled![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nIf pre-dip isn’t available in your country, the screen shows only the subtotal and line items.\n\n![Pre-dip disabled](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/set-reader-display-no-pre-dip.63f146b9e0b0ded9f57fe83d2b9e4a7d.png)\n\nPre-dip disabled",

It’s the simplest way to set up compliant receipts.\n\nIf you have the customer’s email, use the `receipt_email` field when [creating a PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-receipt_email). When you provide a `receipt_email`, Stripe automatically emails a compliant receipt to the customer when [capturing](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/collect-card-payment#capture-payment) the PaymentIntent.\n\nTo trigger an automatic email receipt _after_ the customer checks out, update the PaymentIntent’s `receipt_email` with the customer’s email.\n\nFor more information about automatic email receipts, see [Email Receipts](https://docs.stripe.com/receipts).\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/terminal-pre-built-receipt.64db66739eaf8f8db1f9dd61c463a322.png)\n\n## Custom receipts ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nYou can also customize receipts to include any design and content you want—as long as you list required information. When you accept in-person payments with EMV chip cards, card networks require you to include several fields on the receipts you provide to customers.\n\nThe Stripe API allows you to fetch necessary fields for compliance-ready receipts.\n\nThe following fields become available in the PaymentIntent object as soon as the payment is [confirmed](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/collect-card-payment#confirm-payment).\n\n| Field | Name | Requirement |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `account_type` | Account Type | **Required** (Optional in US) |\n| `application_preferred_name` | Application name | **Required** |\n| `dedicated_file_name` | AID | **Required** |\n| `authorization_response_code` | ARC | Optional |\n| `application_cryptogram` | Application Cryptogram | Optional |\n| `terminal_verification_results` | TVR | Optional |\n| `transaction_status_information` | TSI | Optional |\n\nYou can access these fields server-side using the Stripe API, or client-side using the Stripe Terminal SDKs. When using the JavaScript SDK, the PaymentIntent object matches the [API object](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object).\n\nWhether you’re emailing or printing your custom receipts for Terminal payments, be sure to include the **required** fields to meet card network rules. If provided, you can also access the cardholder’s preferred language (based on the presented card’s settings), using the `preferred_locales` field on the [Payment Method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods/object#payment_method_object-card_present-preferred_locales) object.",

This is helpful if the total price changes or the customer adds goods or services and you need to update the amount on the payment.\n\nDepending on the issuing bank, cardholders might see the amount of the original pending authorization increase in place, or they might see each increment as an additional pending authorization. After capture, the total captured amount appears as one entry.\n\n## Availability ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nWhen using incremental authorizations, be aware of the following restrictions:\n\n*   They’re only available with Visa, Mastercard, or Discover.\n*   Certain card brands have merchant category restrictions (see below).\n*   You can only increment a transaction made with the POS and reader fully online.\n*   You have a maximum of 10 attempts per payment.\n\n#### Availability by card network and merchant category![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nUse incremental authorizations on payments that fulfill the criteria below.

Tap to Pay on iPhone supports PIN entry for devices running iOS 16.4+. NFC wallet payments (Apple Pay, Google Pay, and Samsung Pay) might not be subject to these same limits.\n\nIn the UK and Canada, there are specific considerations for contactless payments due to regional requirements and card issuer policies. In the UK, some cards might need to be inserted into a device to comply with Strong Customer Authentication requirements, which vary depending on the issuer. In such cases, the payment will be declined before the PIN screen appears, with the reason `offline_pin_required`.\n\nSimilarly, in Canada, the majority of issued cards are offline PIN only, meaning they require contact (for example, insertion into a device) to provide a PIN. Tap to Pay on iPhone doesn’t support offline PIN (only online PIN), which means any transaction over the CVM limit (250 CAD) for cards that only support offline PIN will be declined.\n\nIn these scenarios, we recommend instructing the customer to use a different card or another method to collect payment, such as a Terminal card reader or sending a [Stripe Payment Link](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links).\n\n## Best practices and promotion guidelines ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nFollow the [Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/technologies/tap-to-pay-on-iphone/) for Tap to Pay on iPhone to ensure of an optimal user experience and successful review process with Apple.\n\nConsider the following:\n\n*   Connect to the reader in the background on app startup to reduce wait times when collecting a payment.\n*   Reconnect to the reader when the app comes to the foreground to reduce wait times.\n*   Provide merchant education to guide your users on how to accept contactless payments on a compatible iPhone, including in-product promotion and text or email alerts.

[Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/connect-reader?terminal-sdk-platform=android&reader-type=tap-to-pay) to the Tap to Pay reader.\n4.  [Collect](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/collect-card-payment#collect-payment) the payment data with the Tap to Pay reader.\n5.  [Confirm](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/collect-card-payment#confirm-payment) the payment.\n\n## Supported devices ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nAndroid devices must meet all of the following criteria, otherwise reader discovery or the connection will fail:\n\n*   Contains functioning NFC antenna and chipset\n*   Isn’t rooted and device bootloader is locked and unchanged\n*   Runs a current version of Android (Android 11 or above)\n*   Uses Google Mobile Services and has the Google Play Store app installed\n*   Has a hardware backed keystore\n*   Supports generating key pairs using a variety of key algorithms, including RSA and AES from the Android keystore\n*   A stable connection to the internet\n\nAndroid device emulators aren’t supported by Tap to Pay.\n\n#### Note\n\nWhile Tap to Pay supports a variety of Android devices, we recommend using a Samsung Galaxy S22 or Samsung Galaxy A12 for development, if you want to get started quickly.\n\n## User interface![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nTap to Pay on Android includes payment collection screens. When your application is ready to collect a payment, the Stripe Terminal SDK takes over the display to handle the collection process. After you call the [collect payment](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/collect-card-payment#collect-payment) method, your application continues to run while Tap to Pay displays a full-screen prompt that instructs the cardholder to tap their card or NFC-based mobile wallet. If there’s an error reading the card, a prompt for retry displays. A successful tap returns a success indication and then your application regains control to [confirm the payment](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/collect-card-payment#confirm-payment).\n\n### Device-specific NFC tap zone UI![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe Tap to Pay on Android SDK supports device-specific UX that dynamically indicates to the end user where the tap zone is located on the device. View examples of what the UX might look like in practice:\n\nThe devices listed below are confirmed to meet the current hardware and minimum OS requirements. Device and operating system requirements might change in the future due to new security requirements.\n\n*   Google\n    *   Pixel 2, Pixel 2 XL, Pixel 3, Pixel 3 XL, Pixel 4, Pixel 4 XL\n    *   Pixel 5, Pixel 6, Pixel 6 Pro, Pixel 7, Pixel 7 Pro, Pixel 8, Pixel 8 Pro\n    *   Pixel 3a, Pixel 3a XL, Pixel 4a, Pixel 5a, Pixel 6a, Pixel 7a\n*   Samsung\n    *   Galaxy A12, Galaxy A13, Galaxy A14\n    *   Galaxy A21, Galaxy A21s, Galaxy A22, Galaxy A23, Galaxy A24\n    *   Galaxy A32, Galaxy A33, Galaxy A34\n    *   Galaxy A41, Galaxy A42\n    *   Galaxy A51, Galaxy A52, Galaxy A53, Galaxy A54\n    *   Galaxy A70, Galaxy A70s, Galaxy A71, Galaxy A72, Galaxy A73\n    *   Galaxy S10, Galaxy S20, Galaxy S21, Galaxy S22, Galaxy S23, Galaxy S24\n    *   Galaxy Note10, Galaxy Note20\n    *   Galaxy Tab Active3, Tab Active4 Pro\n*   Oppo\n    *   A16s, A54s, A73, A74, A94, A96\n    *   Reno5, Reno6, Reno7\n    *   Find X3, Find X5, Find X6, Find X7\n*   OnePlus\n    *   6, 6T, 7, 7 Pro, 7T, 7T Pro\n    *   8, 8 Pro, 8T, Nord, 9, 9 Pro, 9RT, 9R\n    *   10 Pro, 10R\n    *   Nord CE, Nord 2, Nord CE 2, Nord N10, Nord N20, Nord N200\n*   Xiaomi\n    *   Mi 10T, Mi Note 10\n    *   Redmi 9, Redmi 9T, Redmi 10, Redmi 11T\n    *   Redmi Note 9, Redmi Note 10, Redmi Note 11, Redmi Note 12\n    *   Poco X4, Poco X5, Poco X6\n\n## Cardholder verification limits and fallback ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nSome contactless card transactions [above certain amounts](https://support.stripe.com/questions/what-are-the-regional-contactless-limits-for-stripe-terminal-transactions) might require additional cardholder verification methods (CVM) such as PIN entry. Tap to Pay on Android doesn’t yet support PIN capture, so you might see elevated decline rates for transactions above the limit. NFC wallet payments (Apple Pay, Google Pay, and Samsung Pay) might not be subject to these same limits.\n\nWe recommend attempting the transaction anyway. When collecting payment with your mobile device, hold the card to the reader long enough to read the information from the chip. You might need to wait a few seconds after the initial vibrate when the card makes contact. In the event of a decline, use another method to collect payment, such as a Terminal card reader. You can only have one active connection to a reader at a time.\n\n## Best practices and promotion guidelines ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nEnsure an optimal user experience by considering the following:\n\n*   Connect to the reader in the background on app startup to reduce wait times when collecting a payment.\n*   Reconnect to the reader when the app comes to the foreground to reduce wait times.\n*   Provide merchant education to guide your users on how to accept contactless payments on a compatible Android device, including in-product promotion and text or email alerts.\n*   Launch and promote your Tap to Pay on Android marketing campaigns using our messaging templates and design assets.

  "markdown": "# Apps on Devices | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Learn about deploying your Android POS apps on Stripe smart readers.\n\nUse Apps on Devices to run your point-of-sale (POS) application along with other apps on your device. You can deploy your POS app to Stripe smart readers to provide an all-in-one solution, or build a customer-facing app for payments, driven by your POS running on another device.\n\nStripe handles all payments and compliance with the Stripe Terminal Android SDK.\n\nApps on Devices enables the key phases of your app lifecycle:\n\n1.  [Build and test your app](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/features/apps-on-devices/build)\n2.  [Prepare for app review](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/features/apps-on-devices/app-review)\n3.  [Submit your app](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/features/apps-on-devices/submit)\n4.  [Deploy your app to selected devices](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/features/apps-on-devices/deploy)\n5.  [Monitor deployment](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/features/apps-on-devices/monitor)\n\nView the [sample app](https://github.com/stripe-samples/terminal-apps-on-devices) to learn integration best practices, how to collect and confirm a payment, and more.\n\n## Supported integrations![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nApps on Devices supports two types of integrations:\n\n*   [POS Android app on a Stripe smart reader](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/features/apps-on-devices/overview#pos-stripe-device)\n*   [POS Android app paired with consumer-facing app on a Stripe smart reader](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/features/apps-on-devices/overview#pos-consumer-app)\n\n#### Point-of-sale app on a Stripe smart reader ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nIn this integration, both your POS app and the Stripe Reader app run on a Stripe smart reader. When the device starts, it launches your POS app instead of the Stripe Reader app. When initiating a transaction, the Stripe Reader app becomes the primary. At the end of the transaction, the Stripe Reader app finishes and your POS app becomes the primary.\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/apps-on-devices-pos-on-spos.d5f000091839ad34c7d963d7b365599b.png)\n\n#### Point-of-sale app paired with consumer-facing app on a Stripe smart reader ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nIn this integration, your POS app runs on a device that’s separate from the Stripe smart reader. Your consumer-facing Android app runs on the Stripe smart reader and supports the payment transaction.\n\nYou manage the communication between your POS app and consumer-facing app over TCP/IP.\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/apps-on-devices-app-on-cfd.9a008cbbeec4bd909ee061db638873b2.png)\n\n## App requirements![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nApp resources are limited by the device specs, and app functionality might be constrained by differences from standard Android development. Make sure your app can run successfully by operating within the requirements below.\n\n#### APK size limit![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nAPK files that you upload to the Stripe API have a 100MB size limit.\n\n#### Device specs![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe [Stripe Reader S700](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/setup-reader/stripe-reader-s700) has the following hardware specifications:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| CPU | Qualcomm Snapdragon 665 QCM6125 |\n| RAM | 4GB |\n| Storage | 64GB |\n| OS  | Android 10 |\n| Screen dimensions | 1080x1920 pixels |\n| Screen pixel density | 420dpi (xxhdpi) |\n\n#### Device storage![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nStripe manages updates over the air for all apps and software components that run on the device. Make sure your app uses 8GB or less of storage on the device.\n\n## Differences from standard Android![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe Stripe SmartPOS OS is built for security and PCI-compliance based on the Android Open Source Project (AOSP). It differs from standard consumer Android in the following ways:\n\n*   Google Play Services aren’t available on Stripe Android devices. You can integrate Google Play Services SDKs in your app, but you must verify that your app functions as expected. For example, parts of Firebase and Google Maps SDKs won’t function on Stripe devices.\n*   Notifications are disabled and the device user can’t access the home screen. Either your app or the Stripe reader app persists as the primary.\n*   Production devices have a disabled USB port. Additionally, [Android Debug Bridge](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb) (`adb`) and debugging aren’t available.\n\nYou can use a [DevKit device](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/features/apps-on-devices/build) for development purposes.\n\n## Android permissions![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nDuring installation, the Stripe SmartPOS OS automatically grants [Android permissions](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/permissions/overview) in your app’s manifest. The device user isn’t prompted for permission approval at runtime. Your app’s permissions are verified against the allowed permissions list, and apps requesting permissions in excess of the allowlist are rejected.\n\n#### Caution\n\nThe camera, Bluetooth, and location capabilities and APIs are still in the experimental phase and haven’t been fully tested, validated, and approved by Stripe. Their performance, reliability, and stability aren’t guaranteed. Use this functionality at your discretion.\n\nThe NFC functionality in the devices only supports payments—it can’t be used for non-payment related features.\n\n## Apps on Devices and Stripe Connect compatibility![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nApps on Devices supports all [Connect account types](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/accounts). A single platform must control certain types of connected accounts.",

  "markdown": "# Register readers | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Register your readers to a location.\n\nYou must register your reader to a location to accept payments. The process for registering your reader to a location differs based on whether it’s a [smart reader](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/smart-readers) or a [Bluetooth reader](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/bluetooth-readers).\n\n## Smart readers ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\n### Registration code![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nFor this method, you must generate a pairing code (also known as a registration code) on the reader. If a reader isn’t registered, a pairing code automatically appears on the screen when you unbox it. If it isn’t, or if you need to re-register a reader, you can generate a new pairing code using the [admin settings](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/setup-reader/stripe-reader-s700#settings). After generating the pairing code, you can enter it in the Dashboard or API to register the reader.\n\n1.  On the **Readers** tab on the [Terminal Readers](https://dashboard.stripe.com/terminal/readers) page, click **Register Reader**.\n2.  Enter the pairing code on the reader and click **Next**.\n3.  Provide a name for the reader.\n4.  Assign to a location or create a new one.\n5.

See the information about [returns outside of supported self service countries](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/fleet/order-and-return-readers#returns-outside-of-supported-self-service-countries) for all other orders.\n\nIf you’ve placed an order in the Stripe Dashboard within a country supporting self service and need to return some or all of the items in your order, [users with sufficient permission](#self-service-return-permissions) can initiate the return within the Stripe Dashboard. We can accept refunds for orders in original packaging (along with all accessories) within 30 days of the date of purchase. For returns past 30 days, please contact [Stripe Support](https://support.stripe.com/contact/login).\n\nGoing through the flow in the Dashboard produces a return shipping label. After you create the return shipping label, you can drop your package off at a local shipping carrier.\n\nStripe refunds the payment when our distribution facility receives the package.

We’ll only show the number of items eligible for return. So, if you previously purchased three items and returned one, you’ll only be able to select up to two units to return.\n\n![Self Service Returns - Step 2](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/returns-step2.18d56b1b58d3126dc3174bc2583d3d7b.png)\n\n[](#step-3)\n\nThe popup displays the amount to be refunded after you select the desired number of items.\n\nShipping fees are refunded on the first initiated return for a Terminal hardware order. For example, if you bought three readers and then returned one unit through a partial refund, then decided to return another unit, the second Dashboard return shows $0 for shipping fees to be refunded because these fees were returned in the first attempt.\n\n[](#step-4)\n\nNext, you need to select a reason for the return from the dropdown menu.\n\n![Self Service Returns - Step 4](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/returns-step4.d3e033266dc193ff0b4c666ad6fe48cf.png)\n\n*   **Items arrived defective or broken**—Select this option if any of the items received were damaged or defective.\n*   **I ordered too many devices**—Select this option if you ordered too many devices.\n*   **Device setup is too complicated**—Select this option if getting started with Stripe Terminal was too complicated or the product didn’t meet your expectations.\n*   **Other** - Select this option if none of the above options match your use case. A reason is required.\n\n[](#step-5)\n\nAfter you’ve confirmed the information is correct, select **Submit return’**—the option to download the shipping label appears after you select it. You can select **View UPS Locations** to find the nearest drop off location.\n\n![Self Service Returns - Step 5](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/returns-step5.bd0eff6b670cad01b97216f4a32ad627.png)\n\n[](#step-6)\n\nAfter the return is processed, you’ll be redirected back to the order details page. You can download the shipping label again from the details page if needed. Stripe issues a refund to the payment method you provided when we receive the return.\n\n## Returns outside of supported self service countries![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nTo return a device where self service returns isn’t available, contact support.

We can accept refunds for orders in original packaging (along with all accessories) within 30 days of the date of purchase.\n\n## Shipping![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nStripe works with a distribution partner to fulfill Terminal orders. You can choose standard, express, or priority shipping, depending on the destination country. Hardware must be shipped to physical addresses (not PO boxes).\n\nIf you’re a [Connect platform using Terminal](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/features/connect), you can ship readers directly to your connected accounts by specifying the destination address during checkout.\n\n| Destination country | Orders cutoff time | Order amount above which signature is required | Excluded regions and territories for shipping (all P.O. boxes are excluded) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| United States | 11:00am Eastern Time | 500 USD | Virgin Islands and military addresses |\n| Canada | 1:00pm Pacific Time | 400 CAD | –   |\n| Austria | 11:00am Central European Time | 400 EUR | –   |\n| Belgium | 11:00am Central European Time | 400 EUR | –   |\n| Czech Republic | 11:00am Central European Time | 9900 CZK | –   |\n| Denmark | 11:00am Central European Time | 2975 DKK | –   |\n| Finland | 11:00am Central European Time | 400 EUR | –   |\n| France | 11:00am Central European Time | 400 EUR | Saint-Pierre and Miquelon, Saint Barthélemy, French Southern Territories, Wallis and Futuna, French Polynesia and New Caledonia |\n| Germany | 11:00am Central European Time | 400 EUR | –   |\n| Ireland | 11:00am Central European Time | 400 EUR | –   |\n| Italy | 11:00am Central European Time | 400 EUR | –   |\n| Luxembourg | 11:00am Central European Time | 400 EUR | –   |\n| Netherlands | 11:00am Central European Time | 400 EUR | Aruba, Curaçao, Sint Maarten, Bonaire, Sint Eustatius, and Saba |\n| Norway | 11:00am Central European Time | 400 EUR | Svalbard and Jan Mayen |\n| Portugal | 11:00am Central European Time | 400 EUR | –   |\n| Spain | 11:00am Central European Time | 400 EUR | –   |\n| Sweden | 11:00am Central European Time | 4315 SEK | –   |\n| Switzerland | 11:00am Central European Time | 400 EUR | –   |\n| United Kingdom | 11:00am Central European Time | 400 GBP | Jersey, Guernsey, Isle of Man, and the British Virgin Islands |\n| Australia | 11:00am Australian Eastern Time | 400 AUD | –   |\n| Malaysia | 11:00am Australian Eastern Time | 1200 MYR | –   |\n| New Zealand | 11:00am Australian Eastern Time | 400 NZD | –   |\n| Singapore | 11:00am Australian Eastern Time | 400 SGD | –   |\n\n## User roles and permissions![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe following table shows which [user roles](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/teams/roles) can place orders on behalf of their account via the dashboard:\n\n|     | Administrator | Developer | Analyst | Support Specialist | View Only |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Place new orders |     |     |     |     |     |\n| View list of orders |     |     |     |     |     |\n| Cancel an order |     |     |     |     |     |\n| Self service return |     |     |     |     |     |\n\n## Use the Hardware Orders API Beta![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYou can use the Hardware Orders API if you’d like to: The Terminal Hardware Orders API enables you to programmatically purchase Terminal readers and accessories that can be sent directly to your users. Orders are fulfilled by Stripe’s distribution partners, so you don’t have to manage complex logistics and can instead focus on building your in-person payments business.\n\n*   Build an internal tool for your employees, such as store managers, to place orders for hardware\n*   Build an e-commerce ordering system for your customers to place orders for Terminal readers and accessories\n\nTo create a hardware order using the API, follow these steps:\n\n1.  Retrieve available SKUs\n2.  Retrieve available Shipping Methods\n3.  _(Optional)_ Preview the order\n4.  Create the order\n\n#### Beta\n\nYou must include a header in your API requests with your API version and the current version of the terminal hardware order beta: `Stripe-Version: 2024-06-20;terminal_hardware_orders_beta=v4`\n\n### Retrieve SKUs![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nTo render an appropriate product page for users, your integration must request available items from Stripe. Each item is represented as a SKU and includes details about the product, such as the product token and price.\n\nEach SKU is associated with a country: a reader available in the US has a different SKU from the same reader that’s available in Canada. To retrieve SKUs, you can optionally specify the `country` parameter when making a request to the [Hardware Order SKUs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_skus/list) endpoint:\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/terminal/hardware_skus?country=US \\   -u` \n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`: \\   -H \"Stripe-Version: 2024-06-20;terminal_hardware_orders_beta=v4\"`\n\nEach SKU is also associated with a [Hardware Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_products/object). Products represent different categories of devices. If you’re building an e-commerce ordering system for your customers, make sure you only show the SKUs for the products that apply for your Terminal integration. For example, if your Terminal integration only uses the [BBPOS WisePOS E](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/readers/bbpos-wisepos-e), don’t make the [BBPOS Chipper 2X BT](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/readers/bbpos-chipper2xbt) reader available for purchase. To retrieve all [BBPOS WisePOS E](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/readers/bbpos-wisepos-e) SKUs regardless of country, you can specify the optional `product` parameter when making a request to the [Hardware Order SKUs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_skus/list) endpoint:\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/terminal/hardware_skus?product=`\n\n`{{TERMINAL_HARDWARE_PRODUCT_ID}}`\n\n `\\   -u sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc  : \\   -H \"Stripe-Version: 2024-06-20;terminal_hardware_orders_beta=v4\"`\n\nYou can combine the `country` and `product` parameters to only get a particular product in a particular country.\n\n#### SKUs availability![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nSKUs and Products might become obsolete as we replace them with newer hardware. To help you manage planned obsolescence, see the [SKU and Product status](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_skus/object#terminal_hardware_sku_object-status) that indicates which are currently `available` or `unavailable`. You can’t create an Order if the [SKU status](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_products/object#terminal_hardware_sku_object-status) is `unavailable`.\n\nAdditionally, each SKU and Product has an optional [unavailable\\_after field](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_skus/object#terminal_hardware_sku_object-unavailable_after) that indicates when it might become `unavailable`. Because the availabilities of these objects change over time, we recommend using an approach to query them dynamically. You can do this either by making a query before displaying the `available` objects to your users, or periodically (every day, for example) and caching the results you present to your users.\n\nWe don’t recommend hardcoding the tokens for these objects because such an integration requires code changes when a shipping method becomes `unavailable`. If you don’t perform these changes in time, you might attempt to place orders with `unavailable` objects, causing errors.\n\n### Retrieve Shipping Methods![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nAnother required object used as an input for creating an order is the [Hardware Shipping Method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_shipping_methods/object). This object determines the estimated shipping time for your order as well as a portion of the price. You must use a Shipping Method available in country of the shipping address when creating an order.\n\nLike SKUs, each Shipping Method is associated with a country: the shipping methods available in the US might be different from those available in Canada. Each Shipping Method also has a `name`, which denotes the basic category for this shipping method. To retrieve Shipping Methods, you can optionally specify the `country` and/or `name` parameter when making a request to the [Hardware Shipping Methods](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_shipping_methods/list) endpoint:\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/terminal/hardware_shipping_methods?country=US \\   -u` \n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`: \\   -H \"Stripe-Version: 2024-06-20;terminal_hardware_orders_beta=v4\"`\n\nLike SKUs and Products, Shipping Methods might change over time. To help you manage these changes, each Shipping Method has a [status](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_skus/object#terminal_hardware_sku_object-status) that indicates whether it’s currently `available` or `unavailable`. This mechanism works the same way as it does for SKUs and Products, as described above. As with SKUs and Products, we recommend fetching Shipping Methods periodically so your integration doesn’t become out of date.\n\n### Preview a hardware order![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nTo preview a hardware order, make a request to Stripe containing the SKUs, quantities, shipping address, and Shipping Method for the order.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/terminal/hardware_orders/preview \\   -u` \n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`: \\   -H \"Stripe-Version: 2024-06-20;terminal_hardware_orders_beta=v4\" \\   --data-urlencode \"shipping[name]\"=\"Jenny Rosen\" \\   --data-urlencode \"shipping[address][line1]\"=\"1234 Main Street\" \\   --data-urlencode \"shipping[address][city]\"=\"San Francisco\" \\   --data-urlencode \"shipping[address][state]\"=CA \\   --data-urlencode \"shipping[address][country]\"=US \\   --data-urlencode \"shipping[address][postal_code]\"=94111 \\   --data-urlencode \"shipping[company]\"=\"Rocket Rides\" \\   --data-urlencode \"shipping[phone]\"=15555555555 \\   --data-urlencode \"shipping[email]\"=\"test@example.com\" \\   --data-urlencode shipping_method=thsm_MfuTjLaPEgXMa4 \\   --data-urlencode payment_type=monthly_invoice \\   --data-urlencode \"hardware_order_items[][terminal_hardware_sku]\"=thsku_JokaJ6KpLMlDID \\   --data-urlencode \"hardware_order_items[][quantity]\"=2 \\   -G`\n\nPreviewing an order allows you to perform validation on the order and determine the overall cost of the taxes associated with the order without actually placing it, which you can use for designing an e-commerce checkout page for your customers. Calling the preview endpoint doesn’t actually create an order.\n\nTry to minimize the time between making a request to [Preview Hardware Order](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_orders/preview) and [Create Hardware Order](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_orders/create) to reduce the (very unlikely) chance that prices change in the interim. If you’re concerned about this issue you can save the preview and create an order using the same parameters. Then you can compare the saved preview with the order and cancel the order in the event of any changes.\n\n### Create a hardware order![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nTo create a [Terminal Hardware Order](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_orders/object), you can make a [Create Hardware Order](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_orders/create) request to Stripe that looks very similar to the [Preview Hardware Order](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_orders/preview) request. Include the SKUs, quantities, shipping address, and Shipping Method for the order in your request.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/terminal/hardware_orders \\   -u` \n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`: \\   -H \"Stripe-Version: 2024-06-20;terminal_hardware_orders_beta=v4\" \\   -d \"shipping[name]\"=\"Jenny Rosen\" \\   -d \"shipping[address][line1]\"=\"1234 Main Street\" \\   -d \"shipping[address][city]\"=\"San Francisco\" \\   -d \"shipping[address][state]\"=\"CA\" \\   -d \"shipping[address][country]\"=\"US\" \\   -d \"shipping[address][postal_code]\"=\"94111\" \\   -d \"shipping[company]\"=\"Rocket Rides\" \\   -d \"shipping[phone]\"=\"15555555555\" \\   -d \"shipping[email]\"=\"test@example.com\" \\   -d \"hardware_order_items[][terminal_hardware_sku]\"=\"thsku_JokaJ6KpLMlDID\" \\   -d \"hardware_order_items[][quantity]\"=\"2\" \\   -d shipping_method=\"thsm_MfuTjLaPEgXMa4\" \\   -d payment_type=\"monthly_invoice\"`\n\nThe below example shows a US phone number. If the phone number provided by `shipping.phone` parameter is an international phone number, prefix it with an escaped version of the + sign (for example: `shipping[phone]=\"%2B358131234567\"` instead of `shipping[phone]=\"+358131234567\"`).\n\nThe email address provided by the `shipping.email` parameter receives Stripe-branded update emails when the status of the order changes. Use an email address that you feel comfortable receiving Stripe-branded emails.\n\n### Retrieve and query hardware orders![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nAfter creating an order, you can [Retrieve a Terminal Hardware Order](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_orders/retrieve) using the following request.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/terminal/hardware_orders/`\n\n`{{TERMINAL_HARDWARE_ORDER_ID}}`\n\n `\\   -u sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc  : \\   -H \"Stripe-Version: 2024-06-20;terminal_hardware_orders_beta=v4\"`\n\nYou can also [List all Terminal Hardware Orders](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_orders/list).\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/terminal/hardware_orders \\   -u` \n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`: \\   -H \"Stripe-Version: 2024-06-20;terminal_hardware_orders_beta=v4\"`\n\n### Webhooks![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYou can [set up webhook events](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks) to be updated about order state transitions. You must add a header version (for example, `Stripe-Version: 2024-06-20;terminal_hardware_orders_beta=v4`) to your webhook endpoints to receive events properly. We support the following webhook events:\n\n*   `terminal_hardware_order.created`\n*   `terminal_hardware_order.canceled`\n*   `terminal_hardware_order.ready_to_ship`\n*   `terminal_hardware_order.shipped`\n*   `terminal_hardware_order.delivered`\n*   `terminal_hardware_order.undeliverable`\n\n### Update a test mode order status![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYou can update the status of a terminal hardware order in test mode using the following endpoints in the API:\n\n*   `/v1/test_helpers/terminal/hardware_orders/:hardware_order/mark_ready_to_ship`\n*   `/v1/test_helpers/terminal/hardware_orders/:hardware_order/ship`\n*   `/v1/test_helpers/terminal/hardware_orders/:hardware_order/deliver`\n*   `/v1/test_helpers/terminal/hardware_orders/:hardware_order/mark_undeliverable`\n\nYou can only update the status for terminal hardware orders in [test mode](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#test-live-modes).\n\n### Taxes![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nUpon order creation, Stripe returns the tax amounts associated with the order. We calculate these amounts based on the tax owed to Stripe for the purchase. If you charge tax to your end users for orders placed using the API, you can calculate the amounts owed to you and convey those amounts to your users. The amounts owed to you might differ from those owed to Stripe.\n\nFor Italian Tax Invoices, please visit the [Italian Tax Portal](https://www.agenziaentrate.gov.it/portale/area-riservata) to view invoices.\n\n### Invoices![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nDuring beta, Stripe sends monthly invoices for any orders created with the API. You can change the email that receives invoices in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/terminal).\n\n### Shipment Tracking![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nAs mentioned in the [Shipping](#shipping) section, Stripe works with a distribution partner to fulfill Terminal orders. When our distribution partner gets tracking information for the order it transions to the `shipped` state. You can set up a webhook endpoint for the `terminal_hardware_order.shipped` notification to be notified when an order has a tracking number.\n\n### Changelog![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n#### New carriers![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n*   Add new values (`canada_post`, `dhl`, `dpd`, and `usps`) to the [Carrier](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_orders/object#terminal_hardware_order_object-shipment_tracking-carrier) enum field.\n\n#### v4 (2023-01-23)![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n*   Add a new [Preview Hardware Order](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_orders/preview) endpoint. Remove `draft` and `expired` order statuses. Remove the `/v1/terminal/hardware_orders/confirm` endpoint and the `confirm` parameter in the [Create Hardware Order](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_orders/create) endpoint.\n*   Add a new [TerminalHardwareOrder](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_orders/object) status called `ready_to_ship`, which represents a state in which the order is no longer cancelable, but hasn’t yet shipped.\n*   Add new API endpoints to update the status of test mode terminal hardware orders to [ready\\_to\\_ship](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_orders/test_mode_mark_ready_to_ship), [shipped](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_orders/test_mode_ship), [delivered](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_orders/test_mode_deliver), and [undeliverable](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_orders/test_mode_mark_undeliverable).\n*   Add a new [Hardware Shipping Method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_shipping_methods/object) object to replace the former object in the `shipping_method` field, as well as API endpoints for querying and retrieving these new objects.\n*   Add a new [Hardware Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_products/object) object to replace the former `product_type` field, as well as API endpoints for querying and retrieving these new objects.\n*   Add a new, dynamic `orderable` field to the [TerminalHardwareSku](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_skus/object) object, replacing the older `max_per_order` field.\n*   Add `status` and `unavailable_after` fields to [TerminalHardwareSku](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_skus/object), which allow you to determine if and when a SKU becomes unavailable to order. These fields also exist on the new [Hardware Shipping Method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_shipping_methods/object) and [Hardware Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_products/object) objects.\n*   If you have webhooks enabled for v3 and v4 under the same mode (that is, both test mode or both live mode) at the same time, then Stripe sends the `terminal_hardware_order.shipped` webhook twice. We send the `terminal_hardware_order.shipped` webhook when an order transitions to `ready_to_ship` and `shipped` as opposed to only sending it when an order transitions to `shipped`. Having v3 in live mode and v4 in test mode doesn’t cause duplicate webhooks. If you need to have both v3 and v4 active under the same mode at the same time, make sure to update your integration to handle duplicate `terminal_hardware_order.shipped` webhooks first.\n*   Orders that are `ready_to_ship` in v4 appear as `shipped` in v3. You might see an order with status `shipped` in v3 and `ready_to_ship` in v4 as you’re updating your migration. This happens because the `ready_to_ship` concept doesn’t exist in v3; the status of these orders doesn’t actually regress.\n\n#### v3 (2019-04-03) Deprecated![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n*   Update [Terminal Hardware SKU](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_skus/object) and the [Terminal Hardware Order line item SKU object](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_orders/object#terminal_hardware_order_object-hardware_order_items-terminal_hardware_sku) by removing text fields such as `name`, `description`, `images`, and `attributes`.\n*   Make the `shipping_country` query parameter in [Hardware Order SKUs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_skus/list) optional and rename it to `country`.\n*   Add the ability to query SKUs in the API by `product_type` and `country`.\n\n#### v2 (2019-12-20) Deprecated![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n*   Update [Terminal Hardware Order](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_orders/object) by turning `total_tax_amounts.rate.jurisdiction` from a structured object into a string.\n\n#### v1 (2019-11-20) Deprecated![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n*   Initial release",

It uses hundreds of signals about each payment, and taps into data across our network of millions of businesses, to predict whether a payment is likely to be fraudulent.\n\nOur [machine learning system](https://stripe.com/radar/guide) is flexible and responsive, continuously learns from new customer purchase patterns and transaction features, and incorporates feedback from you whenever payments are indicated as fraudulent.\n\n#### Note\n\nWhen a business using Stripe sees a card for the first time, there’s a 91% chance that we’ve seen the card elsewhere on the Stripe network in the past.\n\n## When to use Radar![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nRadar evaluates risk and runs rules for three different types of Stripe API objects: [Charges](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges), [PaymentIntents](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents) and [SetupIntents](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_intents). Stripe designed the Radar rules to take four different actions:\n\n*   Request 3DS authentication\n*   Allow the creation of the object\n*   Block the creation of the object\n*   Review the creation of a Charge\n\nThe following table illustrates which rules Radar runs for each type of API object:\n\n| Transaction type | Request 3DS | Allow & Block | Review |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Charge |     | ✔   | ✔   |\n| PaymentIntent | ✔   | ✔   | ✔   |\n| SetupIntent | ✔   | ✔   |     |\n\nYou can enable Radar for SetupIntents in your [Radar settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/radar/settings).\n\n## Risk outcomes![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe Stripe machine learning models evaluate the likelihood that a payment is fraudulent. This judgment can take one of five values:\n\n*   [High risk](#high-risk)\n*   [Elevated risk](#elevated-risk)\n*   [Normal risk](#normal-risk)\n*   [Not evaluated](#not-evaluated)\n*   [Unknown risk](#unknown-risk)\n\nEach payment includes information on the _outcome_ of our risk evaluation.\n\nRadar for fraud teams users will see a [risk insights](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/reviews/risk-insights) section on the payment page that provides more details about why we assigned a payment a particular risk level and score.\n\nIf a card issuer [declines](https://docs.stripe.com/declines) a payment, Stripe also includes any information we receive from them as part of the outcome.\n\nThe outcome for each payment is available when viewing a payment in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/) or through the API as part of the [Outcome](https://docs.stripe.com/api#charge_object-outcome) attribute of the [Charge](https://docs.stripe.com/api#charge_object) object.\n\n### High risk payments ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nStripe reports payments as high risk when we believe they’re likely to be fraudulent. Payments of this risk level are [blocked](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/rules#built-in-rules) by default.\n\nOn the `Charge` object of a high risk payment, the `risk_level` is set to `highest`.\n\n`... \"outcome\": {   \"network_status\": \"not_sent_to_network\",   \"reason\": \"highest_risk_level\",   \"risk_level\": \"highest\",   \"risk_score\": 92, // Provided only with Stripe Radar for Fraud Teams   \"seller_message\": \"Stripe blocked this charge as too risky.\",   \"type\": \"blocked\", } ...`\n\nIf Stripe Radar ever blocks a payment that you know is legitimate, you can remove the block using the Dashboard. To do this, view the payment in the Dashboard and click **Add to allow list**. Adding a payment to the allow list doesn’t retry the payment, but it does prevent Stripe Radar from blocking future payment attempts with that card or email address.\n\n#### Note\n\nDon’t see **Add to allow list**? [Contact Stripe](https://support.stripe.com/email) to have this feature added to your Radar account.\n\n### Elevated risk payments ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nElevated risk payments have an increased chance of being fraudulent. Stripe Radar allows payments of this risk level by default. Stripe Radar for Fraud Teams automatically places elevated risk payments into your [review](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/reviews) queue so you can take a closer look.\n\nOn the `Charge` object of an elevated risk payment, the `risk_level` is set to `elevated`.\n\n`... \"outcome\": {   \"network_status\": \"approved_by_network\",   \"reason\": \"elevated_risk_level\",   \"risk_level\": \"elevated\",   \"risk_score\": 56, // Provided only with Stripe Radar for Fraud Teams   \"seller_message\": \"Stripe evaluated this charge as having elevated risk, and placed it in your manual review queue.\",   \"type\": \"manual_review\" } ...`\n\n### Normal risk payments ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nPayments with a normal risk evaluation have fewer characteristics that are strongly indicative of fraud than payments with elevated or high risk levels. However, we recommend that you continue to be vigilant when fulfilling these orders. Payments that have normal risk can still turn out to be fraudulent and there are other possible [types of fraud](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/prevention/identifying-fraud) that can occur later on in the order process.\n\nOn the `Charge` object of a successful payment with normal risk, the `risk_level` is set to `normal`.\n\n`... \"outcome\": {   \"network_status\": \"approved_by_network\",   \"reason\": null,   \"seller_message\": \"The charge was authorized.\",   \"risk_level\": \"normal\",   \"risk_score\": 23, // Provided only with Stripe Radar for Fraud Teams   \"type\": \"authorized\", } ...`\n\n### Not evaluated ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nThe Risk level is set to `not_assessed` for non-card payments, card-based payments predating the public assignment of risk levels, and for payments where the merchant opts out of Radar fraud risk assessment.\n\nOn the `Charge` object of an unevaluated payment, the `risk_level` is set to `not_assessed`.\n\n`... \"outcome\": {   \"network_status\": \"approved_by_network\",   \"reason\": \"not_assessed_risk_level\",   \"risk_level\": \"not_assessed\",   \"seller_message\": \"Your business has opted out of Radar fraud risk assessments.\",   \"type\": \"authorized\" } ...`\n\n### Unknown risk payments ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nIn unusual cases, an error might cause risk evaluation to fail. In this case, Stripe reports the payment as having unknown risk.\n\nOn the `Charge` object of an unknown risk payment, the `risk_level` is set to `unknown`.\n\n`... \"outcome\": {   \"network_status\": \"approved_by_network\",   \"reason\": \"unknown_risk_level\",   \"risk_level\": \"unknown\",   \"seller_message\": \"Something went wrong while evaluating this payment. Our engineers have been notified and we’ll look into this as soon as possible.\",   \"type\": \"authorized\" } ...`\n\n## Searching for a specific risk level in the Dashboard![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYou can search for payments of a specific risk level using the **risk\\_level** search term and the desired risk level. For example, a search for [risk\\_level:highest](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/search?query=risk_level%3Ahighest) returns a list of all payments with a high risk level. Likewise, a search for [risk\\_level:elevated](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/search?query=risk_level%3Aelevated) returns a list of all payments with an elevated risk level.\n\n## Feedback on risk evaluations![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nWhile we use information across our network to evaluate a payment, you might have additional information about a payment as a result of a customer interaction. The Stripe machine learning models respond to feedback you share with us, and you can help improve our fraud detection algorithms by [refunding](https://docs.stripe.com/refunds) and reporting payments that you believe are fraudulent.\n\nRefunding fraudulent payments helps improve our fraud detection algorithms and the accuracy of our risk evaluations for this payment, and similar ones in the future.\n\nTo refund a payment and mark it as fraudulent, view the payment in the Dashboard and then:\n\n1.  Click **Refund**.\n2.  Select **Fraudulent** as the **Reason**.\n3.  Provide a brief explanation.\n\nYou can also indicate that a payment is fraudulent when you [create a refund](https://docs.stripe.com/api#create_refund) using the API by providing `fraudulent` as the value for `reason`. This adds the email address and card fingerprint associated with the payment to the default email address and card fingerprint [block lists](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/lists#default-lists).\n\n`# Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production. # See your keys here: [https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys) Stripe.api_key =` \n\n`'sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc'`\n\n`# If you haven't refunded the charge, you can do so and let Stripe # know it was fraudulent in one step. Stripe::Refund.create({   charge: '{{CHARGE_ID}}',   reason: 'fraudulent', })  # If you already refunded the charge (without specifying the # 'fraudulent' reason), you can still let us know it was fraudulent. Stripe::Charge.update(   '{{CHARGE_ID}}',   {     fraud_details: {       user_report: 'fraudulent',     },   } )`\n\nFor a small subset of charges, Stripe modifies the reported risk score so we can measure the performance of our models and obtain data for subsequent model development. This allows Stripe to ensure key metrics like false positive rate and recall remain within desirable ranges, and that model performance continues to improve.\n\nIf you don’t want the protection of the Stripe Radar machine learning models, you can opt out by [contacting](https://stripe.com/contact) our Support team.",

Go to the [Radar risk controls](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/radar/risk-controls) page to make your adjustments.\n\n![Screenshot of the drawer you see when adjusting your Radar risk controls](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/new-overview.34e6267dd144e7f58ab45f3b07a7e316.png)\n\nThe risk settings dialog shows your block threshold, your dispute rate, and other important statistics\n\n## How it works![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nStripe Radar gives each charge a numerical [risk score](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/risk-evaluation#risk-outcomes) between 0 and 99, where 0 is the lowest risk and 99 highest.\n\n### Blocking payments![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe default _blocking threshold_ is 75, meaning Radar blocks charges with a score of 75 or higher. If you decrease your threshold, you’ll block more payments.\n\nYou need to make sure [the default block rule](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/rules#built-in-rules) or an equivalent custom rule is enabled for Radar to block transactions based on this threshold.\n\n### Manual reviews![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe default _manual review threshold_ is 65, meaning Radar sends charges with a score of 65 or higher to manual review. Changing the blocking threshold automatically changes the manual review threshold accordingly.\n\nFor Radar to send transactions to manual reviews based on this threshold, you need to enable [the default review rule](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/rules#built-in-rules) or equivalent custom rules.\n\n### Adjusting your threshold![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nWhen you change your blocking threshold, you see the following statistics:\n\n| Metric | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Estimated fraud volume that is blocked or allowed** | The estimated volume of fraudulent payments that will be blocked or allowed at the new blocking threshold. |\n| **Estimated good volume that is blocked or allowed** | The estimated volume of good payments that will be blocked or allowed at the new blocking threshold. |\n| **Estimated previously blocked volume that is blocked or allowed** | The estimated volume of previously blocked payments that will be blocked or allowed at the new blocking threshold. Because these payments were blocked and never processed, some of these payments might be fraudulent. |\n| **Fraud rate by volume** | The percent of payments by volume that have received a dispute, an Early Fraud Warning (EFW), or were refunded as fraud. |\n| **Block rate by volume** | The percent of payments by volume that were attempted but were blocked by Radar or by Stripe. Payments are blocked by Stripe to protect you from card testing and other risks that affect all users, regardless of your usage of Radar. |\n\n## When to use it![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYou can customize the default threshold to fit your own business needs. Setting the risk score threshold requires you to consider a tradeoff between how much fraud Radar blocks and how many payments it allows.\n\n### Block more fraud![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nIf your business is experiencing higher rates of fraud, you can decrease the score for blocking payments. To determine what risk score is right for your business, hover over the **Block additional payments by setting your acceptable risk score** chart.\n\n![Screenshot that shows the chart with good and fraudulent payments by risk score](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/new-blocked-volume-chart.a439ebbb6db56c1245bf744e516120c7.png)\n\nThis chart shows how many fraudulent and good payments you would’ve blocked if you set your threshold at that risk score. Here, you can see:\n\n| Metric | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Volume blocked** | Volume of fraudulent and good payments would be blocked. |\n| **% blocked** | The percent of fraudulent and good payments that are blocked respectively. For example, blocking at 65 would result in 55% of your fraud getting blocked at the expense of only 1% of good payments. |\n| **\\# of payments blocked** | Number of fraudulent and good payments would be blocked. |\n\nUltimately, it is up to your business to decide what tradeoff you’re willing to accept in terms of how much fraud versus good payments you block.\n\n### Allow more payments![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nIf your business has low fraud rates and costs, you might want to increase the default blocking score so that you can allow more payments overall.\n\n![Screenshot that shows the chart with blocked payments by risk score](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/new-allowed-volume-chart.520f969604f2c058be9330391eb05aaa.png)\n\nThis chart shows how many payments you would allow if you set your threshold at that risk score. Here, you can see:\n\n| Metric | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Volume allowed** | Volume of payments would be allowed. |\n| **\\# of payments allowed** | Number of payments that would be allowed. |\n\nIf you’re increasing the risk score for blocking charges, we can’t accurately predict the impact of this change on your fraud rate (as some charges that were previously blocked will now be allowed).

  "markdown": "# Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Reviews\n\n## Use reviews to supplement automated systems with human expertise.\n\nWhile Stripe’s automated systems work to prevent fraud on your account, you can use reviews to provide an extra layer of fraud protection by giving payments a manual inspection.\n\nFor example, you might want to review transactions that:\n\n*   Have an [elevated risk](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/risk-evaluation#elevated-risk) of fraud according to Stripe’s fraud protection system\n*   Were made from outside your country\n*   Are greater than a certain amount\n*   Use an email address from an unusual domain\n\nThe review queue of Stripe Radar for Fraud Teams allows you to examine unusual payments, without having to look at each payment individually. You can create a targeted list of payments to review with criteria that you specify, and review them in the Dashboard.\n\n## Reviewing payments![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe Dashboard [review queue](https://dashboard.stripe.com/radar/reviews) is a prioritized list of completed or to-be-captured payments that might need further investigation. You can review payments in two key ways: the [list view](#list-view) allows you to scan a list of reviews without seeing details about a payment, but the [detailed view](#detailed-view) provides much more context about it. You can also customize the detailed view with your own data.\n\n#### Note\n\nPayments placed into review have typically already been successfully processed, unless you use a [process of capturing a payment later](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/place-a-hold-on-a-payment-method). You can approve a payment as-is, refund it, or refund it and mark it as fraudulent.\n\n### List view![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe list view contains information to help you quickly get a sense for each payment’s possible risk of fraud.\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/review-queue.dfc3436620db92f3dfc2aca9eee5f07d.png)\n\nThe manual review queue in the Dashboard.\n\nThe list view highlights:\n\n*   The risk level Stripe has assigned after evaluating the payment\n*   [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers \"Customers\") name\n*   Payment method information\n*   Customer information\n*   Amount, date, and time of the payment\n*   Device\n*   The device IP address\n\n### Detailed view![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nIf you need to view further information about a payment before making a decision (such as any [metadata](#best-practices)), select the payment within the review queue to view the entire payment detail page. You can navigate between payments to review using the **Previous** and **Next** buttons.\n\nThe Stripe Radar machine learning system evaluates hundreds of signals when scoring a charge. The [risk insights](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/reviews/risk-insights) section on the payment page identifies some of the most relevant signals, along with some key data points that can help assess fraud on a payment. The [related payments](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/reviews/risk-insights#related-payments) section shows other payments made to your business that use the same email address, IP address, or card number as the payment you’re currently reviewing.\n\n## Actions![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nAfter you review a completed payment, you can remove it from the review queue by taking one of the following actions:\n\n*   **Approve**: Closes the review with no changes made to the payment. You can still refund and, optionally, report fraud on an approved payment.\n*   If you [capture payments later](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/place-a-hold-on-a-payment-method), there is also a **Capture** button. You can capture a payment before or after approval.\n*   **Refund**: Refunds the payment without reporting it to Stripe as fraudulent. A completed refund is permanent, you can’t undo it—you must process a new payment. If you capture payments later, this button changes to **Cancel**. You can read more about [this review process here](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/reviews/auth-and-capture).\n*   **Refund and report fraud**: Refunds the payment and also reports it to Stripe as fraudulent, for instance to [save dispute fees](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/prevention/best-practices#consider-proactively-refunding-suspicious-payments). This adds the associated card fingerprint and customer email to your [block lists](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/lists#default-lists) and further increases the effectiveness of our fraud prevention.\n\n#### Note\n\nIf a customer [disputes](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes) a payment that’s currently in your review queue, the review is automatically closed.\n\n### Customizing the review queue![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nWith Stripe Radar for Fraud Teams, you can create [rules](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/rules#review-rules) that automatically place payments in review based on your unique business needs. This gives you the opportunity to identify payments that might require more investigation before you can make an informed decision.\n\n## Review Assignments![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nAnyone managing the review queue can assign themselves to reviews to avoid duplicating effort.\n\nAs a reviewer, you can see which reviews other people are working on and assign or remove yourself from reviews. You can also filter the review queue to see reviews you own or reviews that are currently unassigned.\n\n#### Note\n\nYou can only change review assignments for yourself, not for other team members.\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/review-assignment-list-view.3ab75298a2c6c8cd63332cba6384b0af.png)\n\nIn the list view, use quick actions or the overflow menu to assign yourself to a review.\n\nTo assign yourself to a review in the [list view](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/reviews#list-view), hover over a review and click on the person icon or the **Assign to me** button in the overflow menu. In the [detail view](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/reviews#detailed-view), click the **Assign to me** button at the top right.\n\n#### Note\n\nIf a review is assigned to another team member, you can still take action on it or assign it to yourself. You can find a complete history of assignment changes in the timeline of the review.\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/review-assignment-timeline.1a12ea24f415633b9968a63f8dcfb29b.png)\n\nThe timeline in the detail view displays a history of assignment changes.\n\n## Best practices![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nUse the following best practices to get the most out of reviews and perform them efficiently.\n\n*   **Focus time on payments where human judgment can add valuable insight to the decision**\n    \n    Automated systems can make decisions on the majority of payments but human decision making can significantly improve accuracy when identifying fraud in some cases. Because not every case would benefit from human involvement, make sure that you choose transactions where the benefit is clear.\n    \n*   **Use risk insights and related payments to make an informed decision**\n    \n    Use the data in the [risk insights](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/reviews/risk-insights) section to see how Stripe Radar came up with a score for a charge. Combining the reasons for a score, knowledge about your business, and human judgement can help you make an informed choice about when to trust or ignore the score assigned by Radar.\n    \n*   **Leverage the insights from reviewers to develop hypotheses for fraud prevention strategies**\n    \n    As reviewers sort through your transactions, they develop intuitions for fraud prevention that you can translate into better rules. Collect insights from reviewers to [test custom rules on your account](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/testing#rules).\n    \n*   **Customize the process by presenting data unique to your business at review time**\n    \n    Pass along any additional customer or order information as metadata so that all relevant information is in the Dashboard at the time of review. Some examples of useful metadata include:\n    \n    *   More information about the order and its shipping information\n    *   [Google Maps](https://maps.google.com/) and Street View links to the customer’s shipping address so the reviewer can see if the address might be a drop-shipping or freight-forwarding service\n    \n*   **Don’t slow down your customer**\n    \n    A review implies some amount of time between order placement and delivery. If your business has an inherent delay of this type (for example, you’re shipping physical goods), taking the time to review a transaction doesn’t change the customer experience. If you don’t have a built-in delay between orders and fulfillment with your business, adding a review process could slow down orders and create a bottleneck for good customers. Consider the impact on customers before you implement a review process.",

  "markdown": "# Radar Analytics | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Understand fraud patterns and their impact on your business.\n\nThe [Radar analytics dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/radar) helps you analyze and understand the state of fraud for your business. The dashboard contains several reports with information about how much fraud [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar \"Radar\") is blocking for your business in addition to information about important indicators of changing fraud patterns.\n\nUsing [Sigma](https://stripe.com/sigma) or [Data Pipeline](https://stripe.com/data-pipeline), you can use [Radar rule attributes](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/rules/reference#supported-attributes) alongside your own dataset to [continuously improve your fraud management](https://stripe.com/guides/improve-fraud-management-with-radar-for-fraud-teams-and-stripe-data), identify fraudulent payments, create a deeper understanding of your customers, and analyze data in an environment that works best for you.\n\n[](#overview-chart)\n\nWhen fighting fraud, it’s important to see what Radar is doing during the flow of attempted payments. The **Overview Chart** shows you how Radar helps reduce fraud. From left-to-right, you can see payments flow through a few steps in their lifecycle. First, you can see the **Authenticated** column, showing you how many payment attempts went through a 3DS challenge, and how many completed and failed. The second column, **Screened by Radar**, shows how often Radar’s risk score and your Radar Rules blocked suspicious payments, sent others to your review queue, and allowed the rest to continue the payment attempt. Finally, the **Disputed** column shows the disputes on your account.\n\nBelow the chart, a table shows the numeric values for each column. Hover over a value to see its detailed information, with subcategories, counts, and subtotals.\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/overview-chart.11b383fa7a82a7768f56c2772a8e266b.png)\n\n[](#benchmarking)\n\nWithout a comparison, it’s hard to tell what a particular fraud rate means. Is a 0.02% dispute rate good or bad? The answer depends on your business model, your region, and many other factors. Radar provides merchants with a comparison to similar businesses on key fraud metrics to help inform actions you can take to improve the performance of Radar.\n\nRadar has a tool specifically for this—aggregated benchmarks for businesses in your region, and businesses that are similar to your own.\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/benchmarks.b3613b00faa97896806006794c96a4b9.png)\n\nYou can view benchmarks for:\n\n*   **Block rate** — The percentage of payments that are blocked by your Radar Rules, high risk scores, or otherwise blocked by Stripe.\n*   **Fraudulent dispute rate** — The percentage of payments that customers dispute as fraud.\n*   **Estimated false positive rate** — The estimated percentage of non-fraudulent payments that your Radar settings block. (A high value means that you may be blocking too many valid payments.)\n\nYou’ll see these benchmarks embedded in the charts and tables throughout [Radar’s analytics page](https://stripe.com/radar)—hover your mouse over these icons to view their details.\n\n### Benchmarks and Privacy![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nWe’ve taken steps to ensure that other merchants can’t identify your benchmarks:\n\n*   We aggregate regional benchmarks across many businesses in your region, so it’s not possible to discern an individual competitor in such a large pool of businesses.\n*   Benchmarks for similar businesses only display if you have many dozens of businesses in your cohort. (If you don’t see any similar-business benchmarks, this is the reason. You’ll still see regional benchmarks, though, since those are large cohorts.)\n*   For a given benchmark rate, the value for each business gets one “vote,\" so even if a single company dominates your industry, that company is only a small weight in the benchmark.\n*   We only include businesses with a significant number of payments, since some of these fraud events are generally rare.\n\nIf you want to opt-out of benchmarking, [contact us](https://support.stripe.com/). If you opt out, your business won’t be included in benchmark calculations, though you can continue to see benchmarks in Radar’s analytics page.\n\n[](#fraud-prevention)\n\nRadar’s algorithms evaluate payments for suspected fraud risk and take action accordingly. Radar blocks high risk payments by default and provides additional fraud tools (if you have [Radar for Fraud Teams](https://stripe.com/radar/fraud-teams)) so that you can specify your own criteria to block suspicious payments.\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fraud-prevention-topline-metrics.a95d88656deb02a6f229b2d369f16768.png)\n\n**Attempted payments** account for all card payment requests screened by Radar, including retried payment attempts on the same purchase.\n\n**Blocked payments** represents the number of attempted payments that Radar blocked. Payments are broadly blocked by Radar for two reasons:\n\n*   Radar’s machine learning model evaluates the payment as high risk and blocks it by applying the default [high risk block rule](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/rules#built-in-rules). Radar sets the blocking threshold at 75 by default and [Radar for Fraud Teams](https://stripe.com/radar/fraud-teams) users can adjust it in the [risk settings](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/risk-settings).\n*   The payment matches one of your other [block rules](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/radar/rules).\n\n**Block rate** is the percentage of attempted payments that were blocked by Radar.\n\n**Volume, blocked payments** is the monetary value of attempted payments that Radar blocked. (The volume shown is in your default currency, using estimated conversion rates for payments from other currencies.)\n\n#### Note\n\nStripe may block a payment for other reasons _not_ included here (e.g., payments initiated by cards on deny-lists that are globally known to be fraudulent or payments made from sanctioned countries).\n\nAdditionally, [SetupIntents](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/setup-intents)—which let you save customer credentials for _future_ payments—aren’t accounted for here even though they’re screened by Radar.\n\nThe following section contains two views that help you understand changes to your block rate over the selected time period, along with the proportion of payments blocked by both Radar’s machine learning model and your block rules.\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/block-rate-chart-and-table-with-benchmarks.971e9f5c2fd02f38b205cbfaade93092.png)\n\n**Radar — High risk score** accounts for the number of blocked payments that were blocked _due to high risk_, their total monetary volume, and the corresponding block rate (out of all attempted payments). These are payments that received a Radar risk score greater than your high risk threshold and were consequently blocked by the default [high risk block rule](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/rules#built-in-rules).\n\nThe **estimated false positive rate** is the estimated probability that a non-fraudulent payment was incorrectly blocked by Radar’s machine learning. This is derived using a combination of the Radar risk level of these payments and global experiments across all payments on the Stripe network.\n\n**Radar — Rules** similarly, accounts for the number of blocked payments that were blocked by one of your other [block rules](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/radar/rules), their total monetary volume, and the corresponding block rate (out of all attempted payments).\n\nDepending on your business needs, your block rate or false positive rate, you may want to adjust the amount of fraud blocked by Radar’s machine learning. [Radar for Fraud Teams](https://stripe.com/radar/fraud-teams) users can adjust the risk threshold (75 by default) at which payments are blocked in their [risk settings](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/risk-settings). As you increase the risk score at which you block, you’ll allow more overall payments through but you may also allow more fraud. As you decrease the risk score where you block, you’ll probably block more fraud but also block more overall payments.\n\n#### Note\n\nClosely monitor your fraudulent dispute rate and disputes activity to understand the impact of changing risk thresholds. In general, follow Radar’s [best practices](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/integration) to ensure your integration makes the most of Radar’s machine learning models.\n\n[](#fraudulent-disputes)\n\nUse the fraudulent disputes section to analyze fraudulent dispute activity for your business over time. Fraudulent disputes are those that were opened with fraud as the [specified reason](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/categories).\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fraud-disputes-section-with-benchmarks.10f57665c4aa462a62e87ff41bbe473b.png)\n\nThis chart displays fraudulent dispute rate (in solid line) as a percentage of payments in the selected time period that have been disputed for fraud.\n\nCardholders may take some time to dispute a payment, but almost all disputes arrive within 120 days after the payment. Therefore, for the trailing 120 days, this chart displays:\n\n*   A partial dispute rate (in solid line) for payments that have already been disputed.\n*   An estimated projection of the maximum dispute rate (in dashed line) after all disputes for these more recent payments have arrived.\n\nThe final dispute rate is likely to fall somewhere between the partial dispute rate and the projected maximum dispute rate, which is based on historical dispute statistics across the Stripe network and dispute activity on your account.\n\nThe fraudulent dispute rate chart tracks the rate of fraudulent disputes on payments based on when the payment was created and not when it was disputed. This is a more accurate representation of fraud for your business, because it shows which specific payments were disputed for fraud. For example, you could use the fraud rate chart to see if payments made during a particular holiday sale resulted in more fraudulent disputes than usual.\n\nThe **average time to dispute** metric measures the amount of time, on average, it took for payments in the selected time range to be disputed for fraud. The expected range is 1–120 days.\n\n[](#disputes)\n\nThis section helps you identify trends in payments that were disputed by the cardholder for any [specified reason](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/categories). Look for unexpected changes to disputes activity to identify changes to fraud patterns in your business and take action to [prevent disputes and fraud](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/prevention).\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/disputes-section.ac0037376f90118327cbe14ab537710c.png)\n\nAggregated totals at the top of this section account for the total number of **disputes received**, the number of currently **open disputes** that you must [decide](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/responding#decide) to accept or challenge, and the associated **disputed volume** (the total monetary volume of payments disputed, not including any dispute fees). The **win rate** is the percentage of disputes received that you won.\n\n#### Note\n\nThis data only includes [inquiries](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/how-disputes-work#inquiries) (which can act as early warnings of fraudulent payments) when they escalate into real disputes.\n\nThe **disputes received** chart represents dispute activity, plotting disputes opened by dispute creation date for successful payments in the specified time period. A tabular breakdown of disputes received by [dispute reason](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/categories) accompanies this chart, along with information about how many disputes you responded to with supporting evidence, and how many you won. The breakdown only displays the top three most frequently observed dispute types; you can [download](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/analytics#downloading-and-inspecting-data-sources) the dispute report for a more granular view into all dispute reasons.\n\n[](#manual-reviews)\n\nRadar for Fraud Teams users can use this section to analyze the current state and outcomes of payments that were [placed in review](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/reviews).\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/manual-reviews-section.f6513b47a973efb5d647ffddb45207f7.png)\n\nThe **sent to manual review** chart on the left displays the number of payments sent to your review queue within the specified time period. As you review payments and take action, the tabular breakdown on the right updates to display how many reviews were approved, refunded, disputed or are currently in review.\n\n#### Note\n\nIf a customer [disputes](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes) a payment that’s currently in review, the review automatically closes.\n\nThe **dispute rate of approved reviews** represents the percentage of reviews that were approved after investigation but eventually disputed by the cardholder. While cardholders dispute payments for several reasons, you should carefully review payments before approving them to make sure this percentage stays reasonably low.\n\n[](#using-the-dashboard)\n\n### Handling multiple currencies![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nTo give you a comprehensive view of fraud trends for your entire business, this dashboard aggregates your fraud data across all currencies and uses daily foreign exchange rates to convert all monetary amounts into your default currency.\n\n### Data availability and date range![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nStripe computes all of your data daily, beginning at 12:00am UTC. Data for each day includes all account activity that takes place between 12:00am UTC and 11:59pm UTC. Radar Analytics data is available in this dashboard within 24 hours.\n\nWhen loading the page, the report defaults to displaying the previous six months. You can select previous months in the dropdown menu, or choose the trailing 4-week, 3-month, 6-month, or 1-year periods. All charts and tables adjust to reflect the date selection.\n\n### Downloading and inspecting data sources![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/download-report.b7d0c43193abccc87895e141f3e8b613.png)\n\nEach chart has a download link in the top right corner that you can use to download a CSV of the data in the chart. Users with access to [Sigma](https://stripe.com/sigma) can further analyze their data by using the **View in Sigma** link, also on the top right of every chart. By default, Sigma opens the SQL query that generates the data included in the chart and the CSV file. You can modify the query to dig deeper into any trends that you want to better understand.",

  "markdown": "# Testing Stripe Radar | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Use the following information to test your fraud prevention strategy.\n\nUse the following test credit card numbers to create payments in [test mode](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#test-live-modes) with a specific risk level. Create test payments in either the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/payments) (in test mode) or by calling [create a charge](https://docs.stripe.com/api#create_charge) with your [test API key](https://docs.stripe.com/keys).\n\n| Number | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | Results in a charge with a risk level of `highest`, but could be blocked depending on the rules you have in place (for example, payments made with this card aren’t blocked if the `Block if :risk_level: = 'highest'` rule is disabled). |\n|     | Results in a charge with a risk level of `highest`, and is always blocked regardless of your rules. |\n|     | Results in a charge with a risk level of `elevated`. |\n\n## Rules![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nBefore you [add or update a rule](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/rules), we’ll search for historical live mode payments that match the rule criteria. You can inspect that list of payments to verify the criterion’s intended behavior, and we also summarize those search results to help you estimate its future impact.\n\nFor each rule you test, the summary includes the volume and number of payments that fall into the following categories:\n\n*   **Disputed & EFW**: Payments that received a dispute or an [early fraud warning (EFW)](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/how-disputes-work#early-fraud-warnings).\n*   **Refunded**: Payments that were refunded.\n*   **Failed & Blocked**: Payments that were either blocked by Radar, blocked by Stripe, or declined by issuers.\n*   **Legitimate**: Payments that are successfully processed and haven’t yet been identified as fraudulent nor refunded.\n\nAdditionally, when you test allow rules, you can also see **Overrides**. This refers to payments that Radar blocks due to high risk of fraud or a custom block rule, but now will be allowed by your proposed rule. In the Dashboard, you can see further breakdowns of these summary metrics. For example, you can see refunds that are classified as fraudulent.\n\n![Screenshot that shows the potential impact a custom rule could have](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/backtesting-review-new-rule.6f8037bd10a5877e60a6237ebdbd414d.png)\n\nReview the sample questions in the following table to help you decide if you can implement your rule.\n\n#### Caution\n\nIt’s uncommon to find a perfect rule that only blocks fraudulent payments or only allows good payments. Thus, your decision to implement a rule is typically based on a trade-off. Consider if this rule will block enough fraudulent payments to be worthwhile compared to any valid payments it might incorrectly block. The trade-off that’s right for you depends on the particulars of your business. For more information, see our [fraud detection primer](https://stripe.com/radar/guide#fraud-prevention-performance).\n\n| Rule type | Implement this rule if… |\n| --- | --- |\n| Block | *   It matches payments that were disputed, received an EFW, or refunded as fraud at the cost of an acceptable amount of legitimate payments for your business.<br>*   It matches refunds and you’re trying to save operational burden and prevent refund abuse.<br>*   It matches payments that failed because issuers declined the payment. Sometimes, issuers might decrease auth rates for you if you send a [high number of transactions that fail](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/prevention/card-testing#consequences) (For example, if a business experiences a large amount of Card Testing). |\n| Review | *   It matches payments that were disputed, received an EFW, or refunded as fraud. It prompts your team to closely evaluate potential fraudulent transactions or other suspicious payment activities. |\n| Request 3DS | *   It matches payments that were disputed, received an EFW, or refunded as fraud at the cost of an acceptable amount of legitimate payments for your business. Note: 3DS does not always guarantee that your user will receive a challenge. This means while you might get liability shift if a fraudster passes frictionless 3DS and commits fraud, you might still receive an EFW (which ultimately can lead to identification in VFMP). |\n| Allow | *   It matches an acceptable amount of previously blocked payments that you have a high degree of certainty should be safe for your business. Allow rules are somewhat trickier to evaluate because there’s no way of knowing which previously-blocked charges would, if allowed, have turned out to be fraudulent. So, with these rules, it’s particularly important to review the list of matching historical payments to ensure these are payments you’d like to allow.<br>*   It doesn’t match a lot of Overrides. This indicates that you are letting through high risk payments. |",

  "markdown": "# Migrate your Connect integration to use controller properties instead of account types\n\n## Learn how to work with account controller properties instead of specifying account types.\n\nYou can now configure connected accounts using account controller properties instead of defining accounts as Standard, Express, or Custom. These controller properties let you specify discrete account behaviors like which Stripe-hosted dashboard the account can access or who Stripe collects fees from. This modularity allows for more flexible configuration options.\n\nUsing account controller properties doesn’t require you to update your API version. **Migrating your integration to use controller properties is optional**. If you only use one type of connected account and aren’t interested in using [a new configuration](#creating-accounts-with-other-configurations), you don’t need to update your integration.\n\nWe recommend you update your integration to take advantage of the increased modularity and new configurations available. The new properties are fully backwards compatible, so you can migrate your integration incrementally while continuing to work with account types.\n\nEach account type maps to a set of controller properties. We automatically set those properties on your existing connected accounts and on any accounts that you create with account types going forward. When you update your integration to work with controller properties, you don’t have to update any of your connected accounts.\n\n#### Note\n\nYou can start using features such as [embedded components](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-connect-embedded-components) without making any of the changes in this guide.\n\n## Before you begin![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n*   Learn how account controller properties work and how they map to your existing connected accounts.\n*   Determine which of the new account configurations make sense for your integration.\n\nUpdating your integration involves:\n\n*   Identifying code in your integration that references the account type, and updating it to reference the corresponding controller properties instead.\n*   Updating your account creation process to specify controller properties instead of `type`. Specifying `type` is no longer required.\n\n## Account controller properties![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYou can specify values for the controller properties when you create a connected account using the [Accounts API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/create#create_account-controller). Any property that you don’t specify is set to a default value that has the least complex integration requirements.\n\nIf you’re building a new integration, you can get a configuration recommendation by completing [Connect platform onboarding](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/set-up).\n\n| Property | Default value | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| [controller.losses.payments](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/create#create_account-controller-losses-payments) | `stripe` | Possible values:<br><br>*   `application`: Your platform is [responsible for negative balances](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/risk-management \"negative balance liability\") and manages credit and fraud risk on the connected account, which requires you to review and acknowledge your responsibilities in [the Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect/platform_profile)<br>*   `stripe`: Stripe is liable when this account can’t pay back negative balances resulting from payments.

This difference denotes a variation in Stripe [fee billing behavior](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges-fee-payer-behavior) when your platform is using Direct charges.\n\nRequest:\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/accounts \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d \"controller[stripe_dashboard][type]\"=express \\  -d \"controller[fees][payer]\"=application \\  -d \"controller[losses][payments]\"=application`\n\nResponse:\n\n`{   controller: {     type: \"application\",     is_controller: true,     losses: {       payments: \"application\"     },     requirement_collection: \"stripe\",     fees: {       payer: \"application\",     },     stripe_dashboard: {       type: \"express\"     }   },   type: \"none\" }`\n\n### Custom![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThese values map to a Custom account’s behavior:\n\n*   `losses.payments`: `application`\n*   `fees.payer`: `application` (see note)\n*   `requirement_collection`: `application`\n*   `stripe_dashboard.type`: `none`\n\nYou must also specify the account country when creating a Custom account, and request the `card_payments` and `transfers` capabilities.\n\n#### Note\n\nCreating a Custom account using `type`, sets the `controller.fees.payer` property to `application_custom` instead of `application`.

Update that logic from `if type == express` or `if type == custom` to `if controller.losses.payments == application`.\n\nIf you create connected accounts that don’t match an account type, consider their controller properties as well when updating your code. The logic for handling those accounts can differ from your existing logic that’s based on account types.\n\nYou can use this table to identify the controller properties associated with each account type:\n\n| Account Type | losses.payments | fees.payer | requirement\\_collection | stripe\\_dashboard.type |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Custom | `application` | `application_custom` | `application` | `none` |\n| Express | `application` | `application_express` | `stripe` | `express` |\n| Standard | `stripe` | `account` | `stripe` | `full` |\n\n#### Note\n\nRemember that Express and Custom accounts have a different value for `fees.payer` than equivalent accounts created using controller properties. When updating code related to collecting fees, you must take into account the difference in behavior.\n\n## Unsupported configurations![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nWhen creating accounts with controller properties, the following combinations aren’t supported:\n\n`controller.requirement_collection` = `application` isn’t compatible with any of the following values:\n\n*   `controller.losses.payments` = `stripe`\n*   `controller.fees.payer` = `account`\n*   `controller.stripe_dashboard.type` = `express`\n*   `controller.stripe_dashboard.type` = `full`\n\n`controller.stripe_dashboard.type` = `express` isn’t compatible with any of the following values:\n\n*   `controller.losses.payments` = `stripe`\n*   `controller.fees.payer` = `account`\n*   `controller.requirement_collection` = `application`\n\n`controller.stripe_dashboard.type` = `full` isn’t compatible with any of the following values:\n\n*   `controller.losses.payments` = `application`\n*   `controller.fees.payer` = `application`\n*   `controller.requirement_collection` = `application`\n\n`controller.stripe_dashboard.type` = `none` isn’t supported when both of the following values are set (it’s supported when only one of them is set):\n\n*   `controller.requirement_collection` = `stripe`\n*   `controller.losses.payments` = `application`\n\n## Stripe-hosted onboarding and account links![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nStripe-hosted onboarding doesn’t support connected accounts that have both of these controller property values:\n\n*   `controller.stripe_dashboard.type` = `none`\n*   `controller.requirement_collection` = `stripe`\n\nIf you create such accounts, you can’t onboard them using account links. The following example demonstrates logic for handling that scenario:\n\n`if controller.stripe_dashboard.type == \"none\"   if controller.requirement_collection == \"platform\"     create_account_link(account)   else     // Stripe-hosted onboarding is not supported   end end`",

  "markdown": "# Upcoming requirements updates | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Learn about the changes to required verification information and how this impacts your integration with Stripe.\n\nPayments regulations aim to create a safer, more secure financial ecosystem by helping prevent crimes such as money laundering, fraud, and tax evasion. Financial regulators around the world enforce [Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements](https://support.stripe.com/questions/know-your-customer) to make sure that identity information is collected, verified, and maintained from certain types of businesses, and for any individuals who ultimately own, control, or direct the business. These requirements are frequently updated by financial service regulators, card networks, and other financial institutions.\n\nThis guide provides an overview of the upcoming changes, and highlights the most significant changes. For the exhaustive list of requirements, refer to [Required verification information](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information).\n\nTo change how you integrate with Stripe, see [Onboarding solutions for Custom accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom/onboarding).\n\n_Last updated: January 4, 2023_\n\n## What’s changing![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n*   **Required information collected from connected accounts:** We’re updating the information we require from sole proprietorships, non-profits and single-member LLCs and simplifying how we obtain legal guardian consent for accounts opened by minors. In addition, an email for the account representative is now required for all legal entity types, and a change for government entities and public companies.\n*   **How we verify business information and provide new detailed verification responses:** We’re updating our criteria for valid business information and introducing new verification error codes when we unable to accept or verify information provided.\n*   **Threshold at which we verify tax identification numbers (TINs):** For Custom and Express connected accounts, we’re lowering the payments volume threshold at which we verify TINs to align with current federal tax reporting thresholds.\n*   **How we prefill statement descriptors and statement descriptor prefixes:** If a statement descriptor isn’t provided, the prefill logic has changed to use either the business profile name, the business URL, or the legal entity name of the connected account.\n\nThese changes will affect all users with a requested [card\\_payments](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-capabilities-card_payments) capability in the US.\n\n## Required information collected from connected accounts![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nNew information collected and new fields added to the API:\n\n*   Businesses that are [company.structure](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/create#create_account-company-structure) of `sole_proprietorship` and `single_member_llc`, must provide their business address (“company address”). In the event that the business address is the same as the representative’s personal address, your connected accounts can provide the same values for both.\n*   Legal entities that are [company.structure](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/create#create_account-company-structure) of `government_instrumentality`, `tax_exempt_government_instrumentality`, `governmental_unit`, `public_company`, and `public_corporation`, `public_partnership` must provide an email for the account representative. This requirement now applies to all legal entity types.\n*   To simplify how we obtain a legal guardian’s consent for accounts opened by minors, the [Persons API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons) has been updated with a new relationship type of `legal_guardian` as well as an `additional_tos_acceptances` field to record the legal guardian’s agreement to the Stripe Terms of Service. If the account representative’s date of birth indicates the individual is a minor, then an account requirement is triggered to add a `legal_guardian` before the account can be activated.\n\n## How we verify business information and provide new detailed verification responses![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n### Updates to the information we already collect![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nWe’ll request the following information from your connected accounts:\n\n| Field | Updated requirements | Additional considerations |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| SSN or ITIN collected from US-resident Representatives (Reps) | Last 4 digits required at onboarding for all account types (including Custom and Express connected accounts) | This is the current behavior for Standard connected accounts |\n| SSN or ITIN collected from US-resident Representatives (Reps) | If the last 4 digits fail to verify at onboarding, Reps will need to provide the full 9 digits at onboarding |     |\n| SSN or ITIN collected from US-resident Representatives (Reps) or Owners | Full 9 digits required once payments volume exceeds $500K | A Representative (Rep) is defined as a person with significant responsibility to control, manage, or direct the organization; and is authorized by the organization to agree to Stripe’s terms. For a representative, the full 9 digits are required at $500K only if no Owners are listed on the account. |\n\n### New verification error codes![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nWhen we’re unable to verify information provided by your connected accounts, we’ll surface detailed verification responses as new error codes in the [requirements.errors](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-requirements-errors) array.

This service may come with certain responsibilities, including tax information reporting.\n\n#### Getting your 1099 Forms\n\nIf you work for a platform that pays you via Stripe and want to learn about your 1099 forms and how to get them, see [1099 tax forms](https://support.stripe.com/express/topics/1099-tax-forms) on the Stripe Support site.\n\nStripe issues 1099-K forms for your connected accounts that meet specific [criteria](https://support.stripe.com/questions/1099-k-forms-issued-by-stripe). This includes accounts that have transactions where `controller.fees.payer` = `account`.\n\nFor transactions where `controller.fees.payer` = `application` or `application_unified_accounts_beta`, if the fees for those transactions are paid to Stripe, they could be included in a Stripe-issued 1099.\n\nFor any other account setups that have transactions, Stripe won’t be issuing a 1099-K. Instead, consider issuing a [Form 1099](https://support.stripe.com/questions/1099-tax-reporting-and-filing-for-platforms-and-marketplaces) to report income and payment transactions. There are several types of 1099 forms, and the applicable form depends on the type of payments you make to your connected account.\n\n#### Note\n\nStripe recommends that you consult a tax advisor to determine your tax filing and reporting requirements.\n\n### 1099-NEC![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nUse the [1099-NEC](https://support.stripe.com/questions/intro-to-1099-nec-tax-forms-for-platforms-and-marketplaces) form to report non-employee compensation.\n\nThe account must meet all of the following criteria in the previous calendar year:\n\n*   Based in the US or a US taxpayer\n*   $600 or more in payments\n\n### 1099-MISC![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nUse the [1099-MISC](https://support.stripe.com/questions/intro-to-1099-misc-tax-forms-for-platforms-and-marketplaces) form to report other forms of payments made in the course of your business.\n\nThe account must meet all of the following criteria in the previous calendar year:\n\n*   Based in the US or a US taxpayer\n*   $600 or more in payments or $10 in royalties\n\n### 1099-K![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nUse the [1099-K](https://support.stripe.com/questions/intro-to-1099-k-tax-forms-for-platforms-and-marketplaces) form to report payment transactions.\n\nThe account must meet all of the following criteria in the previous calendar year:\n\n*   Based in the US or a US taxpayer\n*   More than $20,000 in gross volume\n*   More than 200 transactions\n\n## See also![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n*   [Get started with the Stripe 1099 tax reporting product](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-tax-reporting)\n*   [Configure your tax form settings](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/tax-form-settings)\n\n#### Note\n\nLooking for help calculating sales tax, VAT, or GST?

  "markdown": "# Working with multiple currencies | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Support processing charges in multiple currencies with Connect.\n\nStripe supports processing charges in [135+ currencies](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies). This allows you to present prices in a customer’s native currency and avoid conversion costs for customers.\n\nThe currencies you can use are determined by the country of the Stripe account where the charge is made.\n\n## Currency conversions![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nA currency conversion occurs if the _presentment_ currency differs from the _settlement_ currency.\n\nThe presentment currency is the currency that’s used for charges. The settlement currency is the currency that you can receive [payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts \"payout\") in, depending on the charge type and applicable currency conversion. See the [supported presentment currencies](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies) and the [supported settlement currencies](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/payouts-connected-accounts#supported-settlement).\n\nDepending on bank account or debit card availability, the following occurs when paying out a [balance](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-balances):\n\n| Bank account or debit card availability | Conversion action |\n| --- | --- |\n| Available for the currency | No conversion |\n| Multiple bank accounts or debit cards available for the currency | No conversion–Stripe uses the bank account or debit card set as `default_for_currency` |\n| Not available for the currency | Stripe converts the payout balance based on the Stripe account’s default currency |\n\nIf you regularly charge in multiple currencies, you might be able to establish [multiple bank accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts#multiple-bank-accounts) to have multiple settlement currencies.\n\n[Currency conversions](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies/conversions) use the current exchange rates provided by our service providers, with an additional conversion fee applied by Stripe. There are online resources for [conversion calculation](https://dashboard.stripe.com/currency_conversion) that can help you estimate current market rates. However, these numbers can fluctuate and might not reflect Stripe’s rates at the time a payment is processed.\n\n## Application fees for direct charges![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nAlthough direct charges are in the connected account’s default currency, your platform receives the [application fees](https://docs.stripe.com/api#application_fees) for [direct charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges) in your platform’s default currency.\n\n| Bank account or debit card availability | Conversion action |\n| --- | --- |\n| Available for the settlement currency | No conversion |\n| Not available for the settlement currency | Stripe converts the application fee based on the platform account’s default currency |\n\nIf your platform doesn’t use application fees and retains a portion of the charges instead, those funds are paid out (and converted or not) the same way as other charges on the platform account.\n\n## Application fees for destination charges and converting balances![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nApplication fees collected using the `application_fee_amount` parameter aren’t converted again for [destination charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges); platforms always receive application fees in the connected account’s settlement currency. Use the `transfer_data[amount]` parameter to transfer less of the transaction amount and collect fees in the platform’s default settlement currency.\n\nIf you create charges on the platform using the `destination` or `on_behalf_of` parameters, you might accumulate balances in multiple currencies. If you don’t have bank accounts for these other currencies, Stripe provides a way to pay out balances in non-default currencies to your platform’s default bank account.\n\nThese currency conversions are created as manual payouts with `currency` set as the currency of the source balance:\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/payouts \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d amount=1000 \\  -d currency=xaf`\n\nAs long as there are sufficient funds in the balance for the specified currency, Stripe automatically converts the funds to the default bank account’s currency.\n\n## Example scenarios![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe following examples illustrate how to work with multiple currencies in [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect \"Connect\"):\n\n### Direct charges ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\n[Direct charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges) are always converted to the connected account’s default currency from the [presentment currency](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#presentment-currencies). The [application fee](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges#collect-fees) is converted to the platform’s default currency.\n\nFor example, you accept a charge for a connected account in USD. The connected account settles in EUR. The funds sent to the connected account are converted to EUR and the application fee is converted back to your platform in USD from EUR.\n\n### Destination charges without on\\_behalf\\_of ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nWhen processing [destination charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges) without `on_behalf_of`, Stripe first converts them from the [presentment currency](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#presentment-currencies) to the platform’s default currency. The funds sent to the connected account are then converted to the connected account’s default currency.\n\n*   If an `application_fee_amount` is used, the [application fee](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges?fee-type=application-fee#collect-fees) is collected after the conversion to the connected account’s default currency. The fee remains in that currency when added to the platform.\n*   If `transfer_data[amount]` is used, the fee is collected after the first currency conversion and remains in the platform’s default currency.\n\n#### Note\n\nFor example, you accept a destination charge for a connected account in EUR. The connected account settles in GBP, and your platform settles in USD.

When you use Radar with connected accounts, it checks only external charges. It doesn’t check fund transfers between Stripe accounts.\n\n[Charges in a Connect integration](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/charges#types) fall into two categories:\n\n*   **Direct charges**: Paid directly to a connected account; Stripe applies only the collecting account’s Radar configuration and rules\n*   **Transferred charges** (for example, destination charges or separate charges and transfers): Paid to the platform account and transferred to a connected account; Stripe applies only the platform account’s Radar configuration and rules\n\n## Radar fees![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nStripe charges Radar fees based on the rate for the account that collected the payment. For payments collected by the platform account and transferred to a connected account, you can pass Radar fees to the connected account by reducing the transferred amount.\n\n## Radar configuration for a connected account![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe Dashboard you use to configure Radar for a connected account depends on the connected account type.

To learn more about creating payments for connected users, and which approach is best for you, refer to our Connect [payments and fees documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/charges).\n\nYou can use the Payment Methods API with Connect in a number of ways if you opt for [direct charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges).\n\n## Using the Payment Method API with direct charges![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nDirect charges require creating [PaymentMethods](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods \"PaymentMethods\") on connected accounts. With any of these methods, you must first [enable the payment method](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/dynamic-payment-methods) you intend to use on the connected account.\n\n### Create and attach a PaymentMethod when confirming a PaymentIntent ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nThe recommended way to use the Payment Method API with Connect is to save the payment method details during Payment Intent confirmation. For more information about this process, see [Save a card during payment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/save-during-payment).\n\nWith Stripe.js, initialize the Stripe object and set `stripeAccount` to the connected account’s ID and use the `setup_future_usage` option when confirming the PaymentIntent. This automatically saves the payment information to the customer for reuse with future charges with that connected account.\n\nSee [PaymentIntents with Stripe.js](https://docs.stripe.com/js/payment_intents) for more details about confirming each type of payment method.\n\n`var stripe = Stripe(`\n\n`'pk_test_TYooMQauvdEDq54NiTphI7jx'`\n\n`, {   stripeAccount:   '{{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}'  , });  (async () => {   const {paymentIntent, error} = await stripe.confirmCardPayment(     '{{PAYMENT_INTENT_CLIENT_SECRET}}',     {       payment_method: {         card: card,         billing_details: {           name: 'Jenny Rosen'         }       },       setup_future_usage: 'off_session',     }   ); })();`\n\nIf you’re confirming PaymentIntents from the server, you can make use of [authentication using the Stripe-Account header](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/authentication#stripe-account-header) with any of our supported libraries. See [Confirm a PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/confirm) for additional details.\n\n### Creating PaymentMethods directly on the connected account ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nYou may also create a PaymentMethod directly on a connected account with `createPaymentMethod`. With Stripe.js, initialize the Stripe object and set `stripeAccount` to the connected account’s ID.\n\n`// Set the connected Stripe Account on which the PaymentMethod should be created const stripe = Stripe(`\n\n`'pk_test_TYooMQauvdEDq54NiTphI7jx'`\n\n`, {   stripeAccount:   '{{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}'  , });  (async () => {   const {paymentMethod, error} = await stripe.createPaymentMethod({     type: 'card',     card: cardElement,     billing_details: {       name: 'Jenny Rosen',     },   });    // Handle error or paymentMethod })();`\n\nIf you’re creating PaymentMethods from the server, you can make use of [authentication using the Stripe-Account header](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/authentication#stripe-account-header) with any of our supported libraries.\n\n### Cloning PaymentMethods ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nYou can also create PaymentMethods on your platform and clone them to a connected account to create direct charges. Cloning is currently supported for PaymentMethods which have `type` set to either `card` or `us_bank_account`.\n\nAfter you create a PaymentMethod and [attach](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods/attach) it to a [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers \"Customers\"), you can clone that PaymentMethod on a connected account using the connected account’s ID as the `Stripe-Account` header. Read more in our guide for [sharing saved payment methods across multiple accounts for direct charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges-multiple-accounts).\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/payment_methods \\   -u` \n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`: \\   -d customer={{PLATFORM_CUSTOMER_ID}} \\   -d payment_method={{PAYMENT_METHOD_ID}} \\   -H \"Stripe-Account:   {{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}  \"`\n\nIf you want to reuse PaymentMethods on a connected account, attach them to Customers before using them with PaymentIntents to create charges. You must provide the Customer ID in the request when cloning PaymentMethods that are attached to Customers for security purposes.\n\nIt is possible to clone PaymentMethods to connected accounts without previously attaching them to Customers. However, note that the original PaymentMethod will be consumed, since PaymentMethods that aren’t attached to Customers can only be used once.",

You can change almost all tax settings for forms that you haven’t filed. For example, if you initially set your tax form to report non-employee compensation (using 1099-NEC) and later determine you need to report payment transactions (using 1099-K), you can change the default form type and automatically update all forms.\n\nIf a user with the administrator role configured the tax form default settings in the onboarding flow for 1099 tax reporting, you can assign the [Tax Analyst](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/teams) role to a team member on your account to allow that person full access to features in the [Tax reporting](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/taxes/forms) view.\n\n## Common settings![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThese settings apply to all tax forms.\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| Default form type | Sets the default type of 1099 form to use to report compensation or payment transactions.

When using automatic transfers, the platform is the business of record.\n\n## Display Connected Account Tax IDs and Business Details on your Invoices ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nCertain regions have regulatory requirements for merchants to show their tax IDs and other business details on customer-facing documents.\n\nIn some cases, you can fulfill these requirements by displaying information about a connected account instead of information about your platform. The following steps show how to render a connected account’s tax ID and business details on invoice emails, invoice PDFs, Hosted Invoice Pages, and invoice receipts:\n\n1.  Create tax IDs for your connected account.\n2.  Set default tax IDs for your connected account.\n3.  Specify the connected account either using the [`on_behalf_of` parameter](#on-behalf-of) or as the `issuer` on existing or new invoices, subscriptions, and subscription schedules.\n\n### Create tax IDs for your connected account![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe following example creates a single tax ID for the connected account. Stripe stores the tax ID on the connected account. To create additional tax IDs, call the endpoint again.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/tax_ids \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -H \"Stripe-Account:   {{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}  \" \\  -d type=eu_vat \\  -d value=DE123456789`\n\n### Set default tax IDs for your connected account![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nStripe automatically pulls default tax IDs from the invoice `issuer`’s account during finalization unless `account_tax_ids` is already set on the invoices.\n\nYou can set the tax IDs stored on the connected account as the default tax IDs for that account. The following example sets existing tax IDs as default tax IDs:\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/accounts/`\n\n`{{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}`\n\n `\\  -u \"  sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc  :\" \\  -d \"settings[invoices][default_account_tax_ids][0]\"=atxi_123 \\  -d \"settings[invoices][default_account_tax_ids][1]\"=atxi_456`\n\n### Set issuer on existing or new invoices, subscriptions, and subscription schedules as the connected account![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe following example sets `issuer` on an existing subscription. During invoice finalization, subscription invoices pull in the issuer’s default tax IDs:\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/subscriptions/`\n\n`{{SUBSCRIPTION_ID}}`\n\n `\\  -u \"  sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc  :\" \\  -d \"invoice_settings[issuer][type]\"=account \\  -d \"invoice_settings[issuer][account]\"=  {{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}`\n\nThe following example sets `issuer` during invoice creation:\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/invoices \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d customer=  {{CUSTOMER_ID}}   \\  -d \"issuer[type]\"=account \\  -d \"issuer[account]\"=  {{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}   \\  -d \"transfer_data[destination]\"=  {{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}    `\n\nAlternatively, the `on_behalf_of` parameter also prints a connected account’s details on the invoice email, invoice PDF, Hosted Invoice Page, and invoice receipt.\n\n### Set account tax IDs on existing or new invoices, subscriptions, and subscription schedules![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYou can specify `account_tax_ids` for invoices, subscriptions, and subscription schedules to override the default tax IDs. The following example sets `account_tax_ids` on an existing subscription:\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/subscriptions/`\n\n`{{SUBSCRIPTION_ID}}`\n\n `\\  -u \"  sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc  :\" \\  -d \"invoice_settings[issuer][type]\"=account \\  -d \"invoice_settings[issuer][account]\"=  {{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}   \\  -d \"invoice_settings[account_tax_ids][0]\"=txi_123 \\  -d \"invoice_settings[account_tax_ids][1]\"=txi_456`\n\nThe following example sets `account_tax_ids` during invoice creation:\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/invoices \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d customer=  {{CUSTOMER_ID}}   \\  -d \"issuer[type]\"=account \\  -d \"issuer[account]\"=  {{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}   \\  -d \"transfer_data[destination]\"=  {{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}   \\  -d \"account_tax_ids[0]\"=txi_123 \\  -d \"account_tax_ids[1]\"=txi_456`\n\n### Create tax IDs stored on the platform for your connected account![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe tax ID you create is stored on the platform account instead of the connected account. The following example creates a single tax ID for the connected account without using the `Stripe-Account` header:\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/tax_ids \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d type=eu_vat \\  -d value=DE123456789 \\  -d \"owner[type]\"=account \\  -d \"owner[account]\"=  {{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}    `\n\n## Collect application fees ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nOn the invoice, you can optionally withhold an application fee. The following example shows an [application\\_fee\\_amount](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/object#subscription_object-application_fee_percent) for an invoice with a direct charge on the connected account:\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/invoices \\   -u` \n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`: \\   -d customer={{CUSTOMER_ID}} \\   -d application_fee_amount=\"10\" \\   -H \"Stripe-Account:   {{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}  \"`\n\nThis example shows an `application_fee_amount` for an invoice with a destination charge:\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/invoices \\   -u` \n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`: \\   -d customer={{CUSTOMER_ID}} \\   -d application_fee_amount=\"10\" \\   -d \"transfer_data[destination]\"=  {{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}    `\n\n## Make the connected account the settlement merchant ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nTo make the connected account the settlement merchant, charge the customer using the `on_behalf_of` parameter when you create or update the invoice. You must set `on_behalf_of` in the API before finalizing an invoice—the Dashboard doesn’t have an interface for invoices you send on behalf of connected accounts.\n\nSetting the `on_behalf_of` parameter applies the branding, contact information, and account tax ID of the connected account to the invoice email, invoice PDF, Hosted Invoice Page, and invoice receipt. However, when you use `on_behalf_of` in test mode, emails aren’t sent—just like standard invoices sent via API. In test mode, you can verify that Stripe created an invoice by checking the [Invoices page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/invoices) of the Dashboard.\n\nTo collect payments on behalf of the connected account, the connected account also needs to have [account capabilities](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-capabilities) enabled for the relevant payment methods. You can automatically transfer payments for invoices created on behalf of the connected account by using destination charges. For more information about the `on_behalf_of​` parameter, refer to the relevant Connect documentation:\n\n*   For automatic transfers to the connected account, refer to the `on_behalf_of` parameter details in the [Create a charge](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/charges#on_behalf_of) guide.\n*   For information on how to transfer payments manually, refer to [Transfer availability](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers#transfer-availability).\n*   For a list of account capabilities that are required to collect payments on behalf of the connected account, refer to [Payment method capabilities](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-capabilities#payment-methods).\n\nThe following example shows how to use the `on_behalf_of` parameter for a new invoice by using separate charges and transfers:\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/invoices \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d on_behalf_of=  {{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}   \\  -d customer=  {{CUSTOMER_ID}}    `\n\nAs with standard destination charges, ​​you can set an `application_fee_amount` on invoices. This example shows how to use `on_behalf_of` with a destination charge and application fee.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/invoices \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d on_behalf_of=  {{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}   \\  -d application_fee_amount=10 \\  -d \"transfer_data[destination]\"=  {{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}   \\  -d customer=  {{CUSTOMER_ID}}    `\n\nInvoices created on behalf of a connected account ​​don’t support bank transfers payment methods, such as ACH Credit Transfer and paper checks.\n\n## Integrate tax calculation and collection ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nYou need to first determine which entity is liable for tax.

Your connected accounts see the newly created child configuration in their **Payment methods** settings. Your connected accounts can use the dropdown menu at the top of the page to choose a configuration to edit.\n\nIf you want your connected accounts to customize their **Payment methods** settings from your platform dashboard instead of the Stripe Dashboard, or if you have connected accounts who don’t have Stripe Dashboard access, you can integrate with the Payment Method Configurations API.\n\nUse the Payment Method Configurations API with the connected account ID and child configuration ID to read the current state of a payment method for a specific connected account on that configuration.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/payment_method_configurations/`\n\n`{{PAYMENT_METHOD_CONFIGURATION_ID}}`\n\n `\\  -u \"  sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc  :\" \\  -H \"Stripe-Account:   {{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}  \"`\n\n`{   \"object\": \"list\",   \"data\": [     {       \"id\":` \n\n`\"{{PAYMENT_METHOD_CONFIGURATION_ID}}\"`\n\n`,       \"object\": \"payment_method_configuration\",       \"name\": \"My Custom Configuration\",       \"active\": true,       \"is_default\": true,       \"livemode\": false,       \"parent\":   \"{{PAYMENT_METHOD_CONFIGURATION_ID}}\"  ,       \"acss_debit\": {         \"available\": false,         \"display_preference\": {           \"overridable\": true,           \"preference\": \"off\",           \"value\": \"off\"         }       },       \"affirm\": {         \"available\": false,         \"display_preference\": {           \"overridable\": true,           \"preference\": \"off\",           \"value\": \"off\"         }       },       \"afterpay_clearpay\": {         \"available\": false,         \"display_preference\": {           \"overridable\": true,           \"preference\": \"off\",           \"value\": \"off\"         }       },       ... additional payment methods     }   ],   \"has_more\": false,   \"url\": \"/v1/payment_method_configurations\" }`\n\nIf successful, the return list displays each payment method and includes two parameters outlining availability and display preference.\n\n*   `available` is the combination of [capability](https://docs.stripe.com/api/capabilities/object) value (`active`, `inactive`, `pending`, or `unrequested`) and `display_preference` value.\n    \n    You can use the `available` field to know whether or not a buyer sees this payment method at checkout time. If `available` is `true`, that payment method’s capability is active and `display_preference` is on. If `available` is `false`, the payment method either doesn’t have an active capability or the `display_preference` value is off, and buyers won’t see it at checkout time. To simplify your integration and take advantage of other features, use payment methods that you manage from the Dashboard at checkout, which automatically reads this parameter and shows the right payment methods to buyers.\n    \n*   `display_preference` has three components: `overridable`, `preference`, and `value`.\n    \n    *   `overridable` is read-only, and indicates whether the connected account’s preference can override the default set above.\n    *   `preference` is writable, and stores the connected account’s preference.\n    *   `value` is read-only, and reflects the effective `display_preference` value.\n\n#### Note\n\nOnly payment methods that are relevant in the connected account’s country are shown in the API response and are configurable. [Check country support](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/integration-options).\n\nWhen a connected account owner takes action to turn on or off a payment method, you can update the `display_preference` `preference` attribute.

  "markdown": "# Understanding Connect account balances | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Learn how Stripe account balances work when using Connect.\n\nBoth your platform account and a connected account are still just Stripe accounts, each with their own, separate account balance.\n\nAll Stripe accounts can have balances in two states:\n\n*   `pending`, meaning the funds are not yet available to pay out\n*   `available`, meaning the funds can be paid out now\n\nWith non-Connect accounts, processing charges increases the Stripe account balance. The charged amount, less any Stripe fees, is initially reflected on the pending balance, and becomes available on a 2\\-day rolling basis. (This timing can vary by country and account.) Available funds can be paid out to a bank account or debit card. [Payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts \"payout\") reduce the Stripe account balance accordingly.\n\nWith [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect \"Connect\"), your platform account and each connected account has its own `pending` and `available` balances. The allocation of funds between them depends on [the type of charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/charges) that you use.\n\nFurther, a platform account can also have a `connect_reserved` balance, used to offset negative balances on connected accounts.\n\n## Check a connected account’s balance ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nTo check the balance of a connected account, perform a [retrieve balance](https://docs.stripe.com/api/balance/balance_retrieve) call authenticated as the connected account. The returned [Balance object](https://docs.stripe.com/api#balance_object) reflects the `pending` and `available` balances.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/balance \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -H \"Stripe-Account:   {{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}  \"`\n\n## Accounting for negative balances ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nSome actions, such as refunds and chargebacks, create negative transactions in a Stripe account. Stripe handles negative transactions to optimize for keeping a positive Stripe balance for related accounts:\n\n*   If at all possible, Stripe automatically offsets negative transactions against future payments\n*   Stripe first assigns negative transactions to the account on which the associated charge was made. For example, when charging on a connected account, a refund or chargeback comes from the connected account. When charging on your platform, a refund or chargeback comes from your platform account.\n\nDespite these measures, if a connected account balance becomes negative, ultimate responsibility depends on the account type.\n\n*   A connected Standard account is always responsible to cover its negative balances\n*   For Express and Custom accounts, the platform is responsible to cover negative balances\n\nIf a connected account balance is negative, Stripe debits their external account on file up to the maximum number of attempts allowed. If all attempts fail, Stripe pauses payouts to and debits from the external account until the external account on file is updated.\n\nWhile an account’s balance is negative, you can’t send payouts to the account’s bank or debit card on their behalf. Stripe will resume sending payouts to the connected account when the account’s Stripe balance is again positive.\n\n### Automatically debit connected accounts![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nIf Stripe hasn’t already attempted to debit a connected account’s external account for a negative balance, you can set [debit\\_negative\\_balances](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-settings-payouts-debit_negative_balances) to `true` to allow Stripe to automatically do so.\n\n#### Caution\n\nStripe can’t correct a negative Stripe account balance using a debit card.\n\nAuto debit for negative balances is supported for banks in the following countries:\n\n*   Australia\n*   Canada\n*   Europe (SEPA countries, which includes the UK)\n*   New Zealand\n*   United States\n\nSee the [Auto Debit FAQ](https://support.stripe.com/questions/auto-debit-faq) for a detailed breakdown of which countries and account types are supported.\n\nEnabling `debit_negative_balances` triggers debits as needed, even when the connected account is on manual payouts. For more details, see [Impact from chargebacks and negative balances](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/risk-management/best-practices#impact-from-chargebacks-and-negative-balances).\n\n## Understanding connected reserve balances![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nTo ensure funds can be covered, Stripe holds a reserve on your platform account’s `available` balance to cover any negative `available` balances across your Custom and Express accounts. Depending on the country that the Custom or Express account is in, Stripe initiates a bank withdrawal on the account’s bank account to cover the [negative balance](https://support.stripe.com/questions/negative-balances-in-stripe-handling-by-country). Although the `available` balance for the account zeroes out as soon as the withdrawal is posted, the platform reserve for that account is held for an additional 3 business days. You’ll see this reserve reflected in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/balance/overview) and exported reports (as a **reserve transaction**).\n\nThere are three kinds of balance activities related to reserves:\n\n*   Funds reserved to cover a negative balance on a connected account. When a connected account’s balance becomes negative, Stripe temporarily reserves a portion of your balance to ensure that funds can be covered by creating a balance transaction with the type `reserve_transaction`.\n*   Funds released after a positive balance change on a connected account. When a connected account’s previously negative balance becomes less negative due to activity on that account (for example, through new charges), a corresponding portion of your platform’s reserve balance is released through a balance transaction with the type `reserve_transaction`.\n*   Funds collected due to a long-standing negative balance on a connected account. When a connected account holds a negative balance amount for 180 days, Stripe transfers a portion of your balance to zero out that account’s balance by creating a balance transaction with the type `connect_collection_transfer`.\n\nTo see the current reserves held on your account, perform a retrieve balance API call but for your own account (that is, not authorized as another user as in the above).\n\nTo clear a connected account’s negative balance, and thereby remove the reserve on your account, send a [transfer](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers) to the applicable account. If a connected account has a negative balance for more than 180 days, Stripe will automatically transfer your reserves to the connected account to zero out the balance. Dashboard pages and reports show these transfers as Connect collection transfers.\n\n#### Caution\n\nAfter a connected account’s balance is cleared through a collection transfer, we recommend that you [reject](https://docs.stripe.com/api#reject_account) the account to prevent future losses.\n\n## Holding funds![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nIf your platform needs more granular control over your payout schedule, you can take one of the following approaches:\n\n*   Hold funds in the platform balance before [sending them to Express or Custom accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n*   Keep funds in an Express or Custom account’s balance before proceeding to [pay out the funds](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/manual-payouts) to a bank account or debit card\n\nWe recommend platforms hold funds only if you have a clear purpose for holding them and a commitment to complete the payment when an event occurs or a precondition is satisfied. The typical use case for holding funds is on-demand services platforms, where the marketplace usually waits for the service to be completed and confirmed before paying out to the service provider (for example, rentals, delivery services, and ride-sharing).\n\nPlatforms should refrain from holding funds arbitrarily, and instead pay out to their connected accounts as soon as they are identified. This is usually when the charge is made. If you aren’t sure about holding funds, speak with your legal advisor.\n\nFor compliance reasons, we can hold funds in reserve for a period of time that’s based on the merchant’s country, as shown below:\n\n| Country | Holding Period |\n| --- | --- |\n| Thailand | 10 days |\n| United States | 2 years |\n| All other countries | 90 days |\n\n## See also![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n*   [Creating Direct Charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges)\n*   [Creating Destination Charges on Your Platform](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges)\n*   [Creating Separate Charges and Transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)",

  "markdown": "# Fraud prevention rules | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Use fraud prevention rules to guard your business.\n\nFraud prevention rules allow you to take action whenever a payment matches certain criteria.\n\nStripe Radar provides built-in rules to help detect and guard against fraud risk for all Stripe users.\n\n[Radar for Fraud Teams](https://docs.stripe.com/radar \"Radar for Fraud Teams\") users can use the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/radar/rules) to create custom rules based on the unique business logic specific to your business. For example, you can:\n\n*   **Request 3D Secure** (3DS) for all payments that support it and are made by a new customer\n*   **Allow** all payments from your call center’s IP address\n*   **Block** payments made from a location or card issued outside your country\n*   **Review** all payments greater than 1,000 USD that have been made with a prepaid card\n\n#### Caution\n\nEU merchants might be affected by the [Geo-blocking Regulation](https://support.stripe.com/questions/eu-geo-blocking-regulation-changes) and its prohibitions on blocking payments from customers based in EU member states.\n\n## Built-in rules![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe following rules are available by default for all Radar users.\n\n### Machine learning risk checks ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nStripe Radar and Stripe Radar for Fraud Teams provide a set of default rules based on the judgments of our machine learning models, which are:\n\n`` **Block** if :risk_level: = `'highest'` ``\n\nThe rule blocks and won’t process payments with a high risk of fraud. This rule is enabled by default for users of Radar or Radar for Fraud Teams.\n\n`` **Review** if :risk_level: = `'elevated'` ``\n\nThe default behavior for Stripe Radar for Fraud Teams is to place payments into review that we suspect have an elevated risk of fraud.\n\n### Traditional card checks ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nA payment can still be successful even if the [CVC](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/prevention/verification \"Card verification code check (CVC)\") or address ([AVS](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/prevention/verification \"Address verification System (AVS)\")) check fails, because card issuers take many signals into account when making a decision about whether to approve or decline a payment. In some cases, a card issuer might still approve a payment they consider legitimate, even if the CVC or postal code verification check fails.\n\nStripe has built-in rules so you can block payments even if they’ve been approved by the card issuer. You can enable or disable these rules using the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/radar/rules).\n\nThese rules also apply to the card validation process that occurs when attaching a card to a customer. In cases where you create the card and customer together, CVC or postal code validation failure prevents the successful creation of the customer record. This rule might not be enabled for your account by default. You can enable or disable it any time in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/radar/rules).\n\n`**Block** if CVC verification fails`\n\nStripe blocks payments that fail a card issuer’s CVC verification check. If the customer doesn’t provide the CVC number, for example because they use a [wallet](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods \"digital wallet\"), or their card issuer doesn’t support its verification, the rule can’t block the payment.\n\n`**Block** if postal code verification fails`\n\nIf this rule is enabled, Radar blocks payments when they fail a card issuer’s postal code verification check. If the customer doesn’t provide the postal code, or their card issuer doesn’t support its verification, the rule can’t block the payment. This rule might not be enabled for your account by default. You can enable or disable it any time in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/radar/rules).\n\n### Built-in rules to request 3D Secure ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nUsing [3DS](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure \"3D Secure (3DS)\") prompts customers to complete an additional authentication step before they can complete the purchase flow. If 3DS authenticates a payment, the [liability](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure/authentication-flow#disputed-payments) for any fraud-related disputes for that payment typically shift from the seller to the issuer. This means that in most cases, the seller isn’t responsible for fraud costs on 3DS authenticated payments.\n\nStripe automatically handles soft decline codes indicating that 3DS is required by issuers. We also trigger 3DS when necessary, adhering to regulations such as the [Strong Customer Authentication](https://stripe.com/guides/strong-customer-authentication) (SCA) mandated by the PSD2. Disabling Radar doesn’t prevent 3DS from being triggered in cases where it’s necessary.\n\nStripe provides three default disabled rules you can enable to dynamically request 3DS when using Radar with [Payment Intents](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment) or [Setup Intents](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/save-and-reuse):\n\n1.  `**Request 3D Secure** if 3D Secure is required for card`\n    *   Disabled by default. Enabling this rule prompts the customer for 3DS authentication if historically the card [required 3DS](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure/authentication-flow#three-ds-cards).\n    *   Stripe automatically handles soft decline codes indicating that 3DS is required by issuers. Furthermore, we also trigger 3DS when necessary, adhering to regulations such as the [Strong Customer Authentication](https://stripe.com/guides/strong-customer-authentication) mandated by the PSD2.\n2.  `**Request 3D Secure** if 3D Secure is supported for card`\n    *   Disabled by default but similar to the previous rule. Enabling this rule prompts the customer for 3DS authentication as long as their card supports it.\n    *   Use this rule instead of the previous one if you want to maximize the number of payments that have liability shift. Be aware that this additional requirement might decrease conversion rates.\n3.  `**Request 3D Secure** if 3D Secure is recommended for card`\n    *   Disabled by default. Enabling this rule prompts the customer for 3DS authentication when Stripe believes that 3DS authentication can take place with minimal impact on conversion rates.\n    *   Enable this if you want to maximize the number of payments that have liability shift.\n\nBecause 3DS requires your customer to go through an additional layer of authentication, indiscriminate use of 3DS might lower conversion rates. Stripe recommends that you enable default Request 3DS rules only if you need to send all payments from supported cards through 3DS.\n\nRequesting 3DS doesn’t necessarily mean the issuer actually performs 3DS. For more details about possible outcomes, refer to the [3D Secure documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure).\n\n#### Custom rules to request 3D Secure and act on specific outcomes![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nAfter attempting 3DS authentication, if you have [Radar for Fraud Teams](https://stripe.com/radar/fraud-teams), you can evaluate the result in allow, block, or review rules.\n\nThe most important attributes for custom Radar rules are:\n\n*   `is_3d_secure` which is true if the card is supported, 3DS was attempted by the issuer and the user didn’t fail authentication. We generally recommend using this in block rules.\n*   `is_3d_secure_authenticated` which is true if 3DS was attempted by the issuer and the user successfully went through a full authentication. Using this attribute in a block rule excludes legitimate transactions that might have an SCA exemption or don’t fall into a clear failure or successful authentication such as processing errors.\n*   `has_liability_shift` which is true if Stripe expects the payment to be covered under the liability shift rule. This might [not always be the same as 3DS](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure/authentication-flow#disputed-payments), for example Apple Pay in certain regions.\n\nFor custom rules, we recommend keeping `Request 3DS` and `Block` rules aligned depending on your [risk appetite](https://stripe.com/guides/improve-fraud-management-with-radar-for-fraud-teams-and-stripe-data). However, don’t block transactions where 3DS isn’t supported, such as some wallets.\n\nHere are some examples that show how to achieve this for different use cases:\n\n#### Request 3D Secure based on Radar risk level![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYou want to use Radar to request 3DS on all charges based on Radar risk level and above a certain amount.\n\n| Radar rule | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| ``Request 3D Secure if :risk_level: != `'normal'` and :amount_in_usd: > 25`` | This rule checks for Radar’s risk level then requests 3DS on all charges with an elevated or high risk level above a certain amount. |\n\nIn this case, without a block rule, cards or wallets that don’t support 3DS aren’t blocked. 3DS attempts with failed authentication don’t continue to charge authorization.\n\n#### Always require 3D Secure based on Radar risk level![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYou want to use Radar to request 3DS on all charges based on Radar risk level of elevated or high, and above a certain amount. If cards don’t support 3DS, you don’t want to accept them.\n\n| Radar rule | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| ``Request 3D Secure if :risk_level: != `'normal'` and :amount_in_usd: > 25`` | This rule checks for Radar’s risk level then requests 3DS on all charges with an elevated or high risk level above a certain amount. |\n| ``Block if not :is_3d_secure: and :risk_level: != `'normal'` and :amount_in_usd: > 25 and not :is_off_session: and :digital_wallet: != `'apple_pay'` and not (:digital_wallet: = `'android_pay'` and :has_cryptogram:)`` | This rule blocks payments without a 3DS flow for charges with an elevated or high risk level above a certain amount. However, it accepts legitimate transactions that might have an SCA exemption or don’t have a clear failure or successful authentication such as `attempt_acknowledged`. It accepts off-session payments such as recurring subscription charges and wallets such as Apple Pay or Google Pay to succeed. |\n\n#### Only accept fully 3D Secure authenticated transactions if 3D Secure is supported![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYou rely on Stripe triggering 3DS when necessary in cases such as [Strong Customer Authentication](https://stripe.com/guides/strong-customer-authentication) (SCA), but don’t want to accept [edge cases](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/object#charge_object-payment_method_details-card-three_d_secure-result) such as processing errors.\n\n| Radar rule | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `Block if :is_3d_secure: and not :is_3d_secure_authenticated:` | This rule blocks payments where the card is enrolled in 3DS and 3DS was attempted but the user didn’t successfully authenticate. Cards that don’t support 3DS, SCA exemptions, off-session payments (such as recurring subscription charges), and wallets (such as Apple Pay or Google Pay) are accepted. |\n\n#### Request 3D Secure based on Metadata![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYou want to use Radar to request 3DS on all charges with a custom metadata attribute.\n\n| Radar rule | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `` Request 3D Secure if ::foo:: = `'bar'` `` | This rule checks for a metadata condition and then requests 3DS. To check Customer metadata, replace `::foo:: = 'bar'` with a value like `::customer:trusted:: = 'false'`. |\n\nIn this case, without a block rule, cards or wallets that don’t support 3DS aren’t blocked. 3DS attempts with failed authentication don’t continue to charge authorization.\n\n#### Always require 3D Secure based on Metadata![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYou want to use Radar to request 3DS on all charges with a custom metadata attribute and block cards that don’t support it.\n\n| Radar rule | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `` Request 3D Secure if ::foo:: = `'bar'` `` | This rule checks for a metadata condition and then requests 3DS. To check Customer metadata, replace `::foo:: = 'bar'` with a value like `::customer:trusted:: = 'false'`. |\n| ``Block if ::foo:: = `'bar'` and not :is_3d_secure and not :is_off_session: and :digital_wallet: != `'apple_pay'` and not(:digital_wallet: = `'android_pay'` and :has_cryptogram:)`` | This rule blocks payments without a 3DS flow for charges with a custom metadata attribute. However, it accepts legitimate transactions that might have an SCA exemption or don’t have a clear failure or successful authentication such as `attempt_acknowledged`. It accepts off-session payments (such as recurring subscription charges), and wallets (such as Apple Pay or Google Pay) to succeed. |\n\n#### Request 3D Secure for all new cards and review if 3D Secure wasn’t supported![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYou want to use Radar to request 3DS on all new cards and manually review charges from cards that don’t support 3DS.\n\n| Radar rule | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `Request 3D Secure if is_missing(:seconds_since_card_first_seen:)` | This rule requests 3DS on all cards that haven’t been used on your account. To reduce user friction, you can add an additional condition to only request 3DS if `` :risk_level: != `'normal'` ``. |\n| `Request 3D Secure if :is_new_card_on_customer:` | As an alternative to the rule above, this rule requests 3DS on all cards that are newly used on a [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers). To reduce user friction, you can add an additional condition to only request 3DS if `` :risk_level: != `'normal'` ``. |\n| ``Review if not :is_3d_secure and not:is_off_session: and :digital_wallet: != `'apple_pay'` and not(:digital_wallet: = `'android_pay'` and :has_cryptogram:)`` | This rule marks payments where 3DS is expected but isn’t supported for manual review. It ignores off-session payments (such as recurring subscription charges) and wallets (such as Apple Pay or Google Pay). Payments marked for review continue to authorization and can give additional signals, such as issuer CVC checks. |\n\nIn this case, without a block rule, cards or wallets that don’t support 3DS aren’t blocked. 3DS attempts with failed authentication don’t continue to charge authorization.\n\n#### Always require 3D Secure for certain issuer countries![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYou want to use Radar to request 3DS on all charges from card issuers originating from countries on a [custom list](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/lists) and block cards that don’t support it.\n\n| Radar rule | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `Request 3D Secure if :card_country: in @enforce_3ds_list` | This rule checks for a condition based on card issuers originating from countries and compares them to a [custom list](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/lists). If they match, it requests 3DS. |\n| ``Block if :card_country: in @enforce_3ds_list and not :is_3d_secure and not :is_off_session: and :digital_wallet: != `'apple_pay'` and not(:digital_wallet: = `'android_pay'` and :has_cryptogram:)`` | This rule blocks payments without a 3DS flow for charges originating from countries on the custom list. However, it accepts legitimate transactions that might have an SCA exemption or don’t have a clear failure or successful authentication, such as `attempt_acknowledged`. It accepts off-session payments (such as recurring subscription charges) and wallets (such as Apple Pay or Google Pay) to succeed. |\n\n#### Always require 3D Secure based on Radar risk level and review edge cases![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYou want to use Radar to request 3DS on all charges based on Radar risk level and block cards that don’t support 3DS, but manually review edge cases.\n\n| Radar rule | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `` Request 3D Secure if :risk_level: != `'normal'` `` | This rule checks for Radar’s risk level then requests 3DS on all charges with an elevated or high risk level above a certain amount. |\n| ``Block if not :is_3d_secure: and :risk_level: != `'normal'` and not :is_off_session: and :digital_wallet: != `'apple_pay'` and not (:digital_wallet: = `'android_pay'` and :has_cryptogram:)`` | This rule blocks payments without a 3DS flow for charges with an elevated or high risk level above a certain amount. However, it accepts legitimate transactions that might have an SCA exemption. It accepts off-session payments (such as recurring subscription charges) and wallets (such as Apple Pay or Google Pay) to succeed. |\n| ``Review if not :is_3d_secure_authenticated: and :risk_level: != `'normal'` and not :is_off_session: and :digital_wallet: != `'apple_pay'` and not (:digital_wallet: = `'android_pay'` and :has_cryptogram:)`` | This rule marks payments for manual review that were using 3DS, but didn’t result in a fully authenticated flow. This would review [edge cases](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/object#charge_object-payment_method_details-card-three_d_secure-result) such as `attempt_acknowledged` and would also mark legitimate payments despite SCA exemptions. Because review rules are evaluated after block rules, cards that don’t support 3DS are blocked. |\n\n## When to create rules![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nStripe’s default rules can block a substantial number of fraudulent payments. Businesses that need more control over which payments they want to review, allow, or block can write custom rules through Radar for Fraud Teams.\n\nConsider the following when deciding whether to enable custom rules:\n\n*   Whether you see certain features or user behaviors as more risky (for example, use of a disposable email).\n*   Whether you want to implement rules based on payment amounts or perceived risk level (for example, automatically review if the payment is over 500 USD, automatically allow if the payment is under 5 USD).\n*   Whether your existing disputed and refunded payments share any common patterns (for example, similar amounts, card types, or countries).\n*   Whether you have existing rules you want to migrate to Stripe—many of these rules might already be covered by Stripe’s machine learning models, and you can check how our system performs for your business before customizing it.\n\n### How to create effective rules![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nWhile rules can help you automate your existing workflows, they can also negatively affect your business if used incorrectly. For example, a rule can automatically allow a large number of payments that are fraudulent or block a large number of legitimate payments if it’s not set up properly.\n\nKeep the following in mind while setting up rules:\n\n*   Rules only apply to future payments and don’t apply to any that you’ve already processed.\n*   Request 3DS rules only apply when using [Stripe Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout), [Payment Intents](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment), or [Setup Intents](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/save-and-reuse), and are evaluated before review, block, and allow rules.\n*   Before implementing any block rule to block all payments that meet its criteria, consider whether you’d rather review such payments first.\n*   Implement allow rules minimally, because they override Stripe’s default rules along with any other custom rules that match the same criteria.\n*   You can create a maximum of 200 rules across all rule types per account.\n\n## Construct rules![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYou can add and manage rules from the [Rules tab of the Radar page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/radar/rules) in the Dashboard.\n\nTo add a new rule:\n\n1.  Click **\\+ Add rule**.\n2.  Choose the type rule type from the sub-menu.\n3.  In the rule editor, construct a rule using the syntax `{action} if {attribute} {operator} {value}` where:\n    *   `{action}`: How Radar responds when the rule criteria is met. This value is pre-populated based on the rule type selection you chose.\n    *   `{attribute}`: The element of the transaction to evaluate, such as the amount or card type. Begin typing with `:` to open a list of valid attributes. You can also evaluate your custom metadata by enclosing it in double colons, for example, `::product_sku::`.\n    *   `{operator}`: How to compare the attribute to the value, such as `=`, `>`, `!=`, and so on.\n    *   `{value}`: The value of the attribute to evaluate.\n4.  Click **Test rule**.\n5.  Correct any detected validation errors, if necessary.\n6.  On the **Review new rule** page, review how this rule performs against your recent transactions to confirm whether you want to enable it.\n7.  Click **Add rule** to begin applying this rule to all future transactions.\n\n### Use Radar Assistant ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nStripe’s rule editor has a built-in LLM assistant that constructs a Radar rule from a natural language prompt.\n\nTo use Radar Assistant:\n\n1.  From the [Rules tab of the Radar page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/radar/rules) in the Dashboard, click **\\+ Add rule**.\n2.  Choose rule type from the sub-menu.\n3.  In the rule editor, click **Radar Assistant**.\n\n![Manual rule writing](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/manual-rule-writing-view.598ac04a039b6222f5f7b46e14a74204.png)\n\nManual rule writing\n\n![Radar assistant](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/radar-assistant-view.4b7580fb9a503ae6df62990b4dea0a68.png)\n\nRadar Assistant\n\n1.  In the message field, enter your rule request. You might ask to:\n    *   _Review payments where the card and IP countries are different._\n    *   _Block Discover card payments of more than $1000._\n    *   _Allow payments from stripe.com email addresses._\n2.  When the Assistant returns its suggestion, you can either enter an additional command to make adjustments to the rule or you can click **Test rule** to see how the rule performs against your recent transaction history.\n3.  When you’re satisfied with the rule, click **Add rule** to enable it for all future transactions.\n\n**Training data consent:** By using Radar Assistant you agree that Stripe can log and use your chat entries to train and improve the Radar Assistant capabilities. If you don’t want to have your chat entries used for this purpose, write rules manually.\n\nLearn more about [Stripe AI services](https://support.stripe.com/questions/use-of-artificial-intelligence-(ai)-in-stripe-services).\n\n### Review rules![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nStripe still processes payments normally when they meet a review rule’s criteria. But we place them into your [review queue](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/radar) so your team can look at them more closely. Setting up a rule that’s too broad can result in too many payments being placed into your review queue, slowing down your customers and burdening your review team.\n\nStripe’s rule testing interface runs a simulation on the last 6 months of charges to determine how many legitimate, fraudulent, and blocked payments would have been affected by the rule, had it been implemented. While testing a rule and examining the last 6 months, make sure that:\n\n*   **Overall volume of payments is low**. Reviewing these payments shouldn’t create a burden to your team.\n*   **Human reviewers add value**. A human reviewer can generally identify if a payment was fraudulent with greater confidence than the automated system.\n*   **The rule results in a mix of successful and refunded or disputed payments**. This means that additional inspection on these types of payments can help separate legitimate payments from those that are fraudulent.\n\nThe following is an example of how to improve a review rule created by a business that wants to review pre-paid credit cards.\n\n| Original rule | Improved rule |\n| --- | --- |\n| `` **Review** if :card_funding: = `'prepaid'` `` | `` **Review** if :is_disposable_email: and :card_funding: = `'prepaid'` `` |\n| Too broad—results in too many reviews | More focused—results in a smaller number of reviews |\n\n### Block rules![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYou can use block rules to block payments that you’re confident are fraudulent, or based on any restrictions your business has in place (such as blocking payments from prepaid cards). If you’re not sure how to apply block rules, we recommend placing payments in review using a review rule. After spending some time reviewing these payments for potential false positives, you can confirm whether you want to create a block rule instead.\n\nBlock rules only impact fraudulent and successful payments, because already-blocked payments are unaffected. While testing a rule, make sure that you:\n\n*   **Keep false positives as low as possible**. During testing, Stripe identifies the number of successful and disputed payments that would’ve been matched by the rule. A good block rule results in significantly more fraudulent payments blocked than legitimate payments.\n*   **Minimize unnecessary rules**. If your rule appears to perform very well but is already covered by an existing rule, your newer rule might not be necessary. Similarly, if the results during testing appear to be mixed, consider setting up a review rule instead so you can gather more information about those types of payments.\n\nThe following is an example of how to improve a block rule created by a business that’s suffering from a high level of fraud from payments outside the US:\n\n| Original rule | Improved rule |\n| --- | --- |\n| `` **Block** if :card_country: != `'US'` `` | `` **Block** if :card_country: != `'US'` and :risk_level: = `'elevated'` `` |\n| Too broad—high number of legitimate payments blocked | More focused—results in a smaller number of reviews |\n\n### Allow rules![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nAllow rules override all other rules, including Stripe’s machine learning models, so use them with caution. Many businesses might not need to implement allow rules. If you have concerns that an allow rule could let through even a small number of fraudulent payments, consider adjustments to further restrict these rules before implementing them. Because allow rules override all other rules, including Stripe’s machine learning judgments, create allow rules that continue to block any payments we believe are likely to be fraudulent.\n\nAllow rules apply to all new payments as soon as you create the rule. This includes any payments that are similar to previously blocked payments. While testing a rule, make sure that you:\n\n*   **Examine the number of previously blocked payments that would have been allowed**. Allow rules override all other rules and Stripe’s risk assessment. When testing a new allow rule, all of the payments shown would have been allowed if this rule were active. This can include payments that had been blocked or disputed, impacting your future dispute rates.\n*   **Continue to block any high-risk payments**. You can do this by adding the following to any allow rule: `` and :risk_level: != `'highest'` ``\n*   **Evaluate a history of legitimate transactions at your business**. You can analyze connections between your own customers to allow a higher volume of transactions based on a history of legitimate purchases. This helps you block fewer payments from customers that have a proven history at your business. To do this, review the [attributes list](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/rules/reference#supported-attributes) and look for attributes that include the word “customer.”\n\nThe following is an example of how to improve an allow rule for a business that generally (but not always) sees good payments coming from customers in the United Kingdom:\n\n| Original rule | Improved rule |\n| --- | --- |\n| `` **Allow** if :ip_country: = `'GB'` `` | `` **Allow** if :ip_country: = `'GB'` and :risk_level: != `'highest'` `` |\n| Too broad—some fraudulent payments are allowed | More focused—a smaller number of fraudulent payments are allowed |\n\n## Maintaining your rules![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nAs your business continues to grow, you want to be sure that your rules continue to reflect the types of customers that you want to do business with. The following are some best practices to keep rules current for the state of your business.\n\n### Regularly monitor rules to ensure they’re still effective![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n#### Rule metrics![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nFraud patterns constantly change, so we provide [metrics](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/radar/rules) to show how these rules are performing. These metrics vary depending on the type of rule, because the rule types perform different actions.\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/rule-performance.8d495f28c352641ff7b710df3c3df2ed.png)\n\nUse the **rule performance chart** to understand the behavior of your Radar rules. Look for unexpected spikes or declines in the number of payments matching your rules, such as allow rules letting too many payments through or block rules blocking too many. These spikes may indicate a change in the types of payments your business is receiving or that might warrant updates to the rules themselves. Updates made to rules are displayed as triangles on the graph and can help you compare the impact of the change before and after you make it.\n\n**Color-coded lines** track the number of payments that match [3DS](https://docs.stripe.com/issuing/3d-secure) rules, allow rules, block rules, and review rules. **Triangular symbols** on these graph lines represent updates to rules of the corresponding type.\n\nYou can find information about the effectiveness of your rules and see how many payments each one has taken action against. You can also view and download a filtered list of every payment that a rule has been applied to. Evaluate this information to help you decide if you need to make changes to any rules or remove them entirely.\n\nTo view additional commands, click the overflow menu () menu. Additional commands include: **Disable**, **Enable**, **Edit** or **Delete** for any rule.\n\nYou can also use our reporting products Sigma and Data Pipelines to [query disputes and fraud data](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-data/query-disputes-and-fraud-data), including rule decisions and attributes for each individual payment.\n\n#### Evaluate rule effectiveness![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYou can find information about the effectiveness of your rules and see how many payments each one has affected. You can also view and download a filtered list of every payment that a rule has been applied to. Review the sample questions in the following table to help you decide if you need to make changes to any rules or remove them entirely.\n\n| Rule Type | Evaluate | Actions to consider |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| General | If this rule no longer match any payments at all | Remove the rule. |\n|     | If this rule has anomalous behavior, such as allowing more payments than in previous time periods. | Manually review payments that matched this rule to determine if this is the behavior that you want. |\n| 3DS | If 3DS completion rate is high, but the number of disputes or EFWs is low. | Remove the rule since you may be issuing friction to good users. |\n|     | If fraud is high for transactions that pass 3DS. | Consider modifying your 3DS rule into a block rule to prevent these users from passing frictionless flow (controlled by issuers) or committing first party fraud. |\n|     | If the conversion rate for 3DS is low. | This might be a good rule since it might be mostly blocking fraudsters, but consider manually investigating matched payments to make sure your good users aren’t abandoning due to additional friction. |\n| Allow | If the number of disputes, EFWs, Refunds, or Failed payments are high. | Remove the rule that allows bad payments through. |\n| Block | Is the number of blocks going down, but your fraud is still steady or is increasing? | Modify your rule because it might no longer be effective. |\n|     | If the number of blocks is going up, but your fraud is still steady or increasing. | Modify your rule since it might be blocking good users. |\n|     | If the number of blocks is going up and your fraud is going down. | This suggests that your rule is effective, but consider manually reviewing a few transactions to make sure that you’re not blocking too many good users. |\n| Manual Review | If the percentage of payments that get reviewed is low. | Make the rule more restrictive since it might be too broad. |\n|     | If the number of successful or approved payments is high. | Remove the manual review rule entirely or write an allow rule to target those payments. |\n|     | If the number of refunds or disputes and Early Fraud Warnings are high. | Convert to a block rule. |\n\n**Request 3DS rules**\n\nFor request 3DS rules, we display:\n\n*   **3DS Requested**—the number of times a rule triggered a 3DS request.\n\nClick a 3DS rule to see the following metrics:\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/request-credentials-rule-details.c22b65bc432aafec9e5bcb6079c53528.png)\n\n**Allow rules**\n\nFor allow rules, Radar for Fraud Teams users can view:\n\n*   **Allowed payments**—The total number of payments allowed by your rules.\n*   **Volume, allowed payments**—The total amount, in your local currency, associated with payments allowed by your rules.\n*   **Risk score**—The corresponding [risk outcomes](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/risk-evaluation#risk-outcomes) assigned by Stripe machine learning models to the set of payments allowed by your rules.\n*   **Disputes from overrides**—The total number of allowed payments that were disputed.\n*   **Volume, disputes from overrides**—The total amount, in your local currency, associated with disputes from allowed payments.\n\nClick an Allow rule to see the following metrics:\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/allow-rule-details.e8da078613fdbca5592d2f9330c0f6d4.png)\n\n**Block rules**\n\nFor block rules, we display:\n\n*   **Blocked payments**—The total number of payments blocked by your rules.\n*   **Volume, blocked payments**—The total amount, in your local currency, associated with payments blocked by your rules.\n\nRadar for Fraud Teams users can also view:\n\n*   **Risk score**—The corresponding [risk outcomes](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/risk-evaluation#risk-outcomes) assigned by Stripe machine learning models to the set of payments allowed by your rules.\n*   **Est. false positive rate**—The estimated percentage of non-fraudulent payments that were blocked for both your block rules as a set and by individual rules. (These estimates are made using the estimated false positive rates of the corresponding machine learning risk scores, which we calculate with experiments across the Stripe network.)\n*   **Est. fraudulent payments prevented**—The estimated number of fraudulent payments that your block rules prevented. Stripe uses machine learning risk scores, calculated by analyzing millions of transactions across the Stripe network, to predict payments with a high probability of being disputed or declined due to fraud and estimate which of those payments were successfully blocked by your rules.\n\nClick a Block rule to see the following metrics:\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/block-rule-details.5df9a2e8652f228cf61b525a32ef56da.png)\n\n**Review rules**\n\nFor review rules, Radar for Fraud Teams users can view:\n\n*   **Payments sent to review**—The total number of payments that were sent to manual review by your rules.\n*   **Volume, approved reviews**—The total amount, in your local currency, associated with approved payment reviews.\n*   **Refund rate**—The percentage of reviews that were refunded.\n*   **Disputes from approved reviews**—The total number of payments that were approved in your review, but were ultimately disputed.\n*   **Volume, disputes from approved reviews**—The total amount, in your local currency, associated with disputes from approved payment reviews.\n\nClick a Review rule to see the following metrics:\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/review-rule-details.10851302ef65dee05ffce64f7989528f.png)\n\n### Regularly monitor your manual review queue![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nIf your review queue is getting too large to manage, check to see if you have the right rules in place. If most reviews end up being refunded as fraudulent, consider some additional rules to block payments. Likewise, if most payments are approved, consider making your review rules more focused.\n\n### Analyze your disputed and refunded payments![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n[Disputes](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes) are inherently linked to fraud, so the more you do to reduce fraud, the lower your dispute rate. Check to see if disputed payments share any similar characteristics (for example, from the same locations or of similar amounts). You can also perform this type of investigation by looking at payments that have been refunded during a review. If you see trends, you can test and create the appropriate rules. If any payments appear to be fraudulent, refund and report them as fraud to avoid potential disputes.\n\nYou can also use our reporting products, Sigma and Data Pipeline, to [query disputes and fraud data](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-data/query-disputes-and-fraud-data).\n\nYou can respond to any incoming disputes using the Dashboard or through the API, and our [dispute documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes) includes some suggestions on how to present a well documented case.\n\n### Anticipate large changes to your business that might impact your fraud rate![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nIf you’re planning any major product releases or changes to your service (for example, a new, high-value product or expanding your service into new countries), you might want to monitor these payments in the beginning. For these kinds of changes, it’s a good practice to set up some review rules so you can examine any new payments. Reviewing these payments and identifying patterns can help you set up new rules to protect your business from fraud.\n\n## See also![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n*   [3DS Rule Examples](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/rules#request-3d-secure)\n*   [Continuous Fraud Management Guide](https://stripe.com/guides/improve-fraud-management-with-radar-for-fraud-teams-and-stripe-data)\n*   [Query Disputes and Fraud Data](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-data/query-disputes-and-fraud-data)\n*   [Rules Reference](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/rules/reference)\n*   [Supported Attributes](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/rules/supported-attributes)",

  "markdown": "# Fully embedded Connect platform integration\n\n## Provide Connect features to your connected accounts through your own website.\n\nConnect embedded components let you add Stripe-managed functionality to a custom interface that you provide to your connected accounts. They can perform payment-related activities there instead of through the Stripe Dashboard. In a fully embedded integration:\n\n*   Connected accounts access Stripe-related data, forms, and notifications through embedded components in your platform’s application. They don’t have access to a Stripe Dashboard.\n*   Stripe manages credit and fraud risk on your connected accounts. For any risk or compliance actions, we communicate directly with connected accounts and they respond by interacting with embedded components.\n*   Stripe email notifications direct your connected accounts to embedded components on your website to review information or take required action. You must provide Stripe with the URLs for those components.\n\n## View the demo site![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nWe’ve built a complete [demo site for our fictitious business, Furever](http://furever.dev/). Furever is a platform providing software for pet-groomers that allows their users to collect payments. In this demo, you can interact with many embedded components, including account onboarding and account management.\n\n## Before you begin![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nBefore you can build an embedded integration, complete the following prerequisites:\n\n1.  [Register your platform](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/tasklist).\n2.  Add business details to [activate your account](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/onboarding).\n3.  [Complete your platform profile](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/settings/profile).\n4.  [Customize your brand settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect/stripe-dashboard/branding). Add a business name, icon, and brand color.\n\nYou must also decide whether your platform will own pricing, in which case Stripe collects payment fees from your platform and you bill your connected accounts. Otherwise, Stripe owns pricing and collects payment fees directly from your connected accounts.\n\n[](#create-a-connected-account)\n\nThe following example creates an account where Stripe [manages risk](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/risk-management), controls pricing, and assumes responsibility for account onboarding requirements. Your platform uses embedded components and isn’t liable for negative balances. Your connected accounts don’t have access to Stripe-hosted dashboards.\n\n#### Note\n\nBecause Stripe controls pricing in this example, you must integrate the Documents embedded component. In addition, Stripe notifies connected accounts by email when their tax invoices or 1099s are ready for download. If you create accounts where your platform controls pricing, the Documents component isn’t required, and Stripe doesn’t send notifications to connected accounts about tax invoices or 1099s.\n\nYou can request additional capabilities, such as specific payment methods, after the account onboards.\n\nCall [/v1/accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/create) with the following parameters:\n\n*   `country` of the account\n*   `controller.stripe_dashboard.type` = `none`\n*   request the `card_payments` and `transfers` capabilities\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/accounts \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d country=US \\  -d \"controller[stripe_dashboard][type]\"=none \\  -d \"capabilities[card_payments][requested]\"=true \\  -d \"capabilities[transfers][requested]\"=true`\n\n`{   \"id\":` \n\n`\"{{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}\"`\n\n`,   \"object\": \"account\",   \"controller\": {     \"type\": \"application\",     \"is_controller\": true,     \"losses\": {\"payments\": \"stripe\"},     \"fees\": {\"payer\": \"account\"},     \"requirement_collection\": \"stripe\",     \"stripe_dashboard\": {       \"type\": \"none\",     },   },   \"type\": \"none\",   ... }`\n\n[](#setup-embedded-components)\n\nConnected accounts access their accounts, as well as core payments functionality, directly in your platform and don’t have access to a Stripe-hosted Dashboard, so you must provide access through your site.\n\nYour integration must include the following embedded components:\n\n*   Account onboarding component\n*   Account management component\n*   Notification banner component\n*   Documents component (when Stripe collects Stripe fees directly from connected accounts)\n\nFor any other [optional components](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/supported-embedded-components), you can use our embedded components or build your own UI.\n\nMake sure you [set up embedded components](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-connect-embedded-components) before onboarding connected accounts.\n\n[](#onboard-connected-accounts)\n\nStripe uses an [Account Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_sessions) to express your intent to provide embedded component access to the connected account. Using an Account Session, the embedded account onboarding component collects all required information based on your requested capabilities.\n\n### Prefill the account![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe embedded account onboarding component collects all required information based on your requested capabilities.\n\nYou can streamline the onboarding flow for your users by prefilling account fields with known information before you create an Account Session. Prefill as much account information as possible, including company, individual, and external account information, following these steps:\n\n1.  Review the [required verification information](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information) docs to learn more about how the combination of countries and capabilities you select for connected accounts affects their requirements.\n2.  To determine the information that Stripe requires from a connected account, retrieve the account’s [requirements](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-requirements) property.\n3.  Collect prefillable information.\n4.  Record the information on the account by calling [Update Account](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/update).\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/accounts/`\n\n`{{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}`\n\n `\\  -u \"  sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc  :\" \\  -d business_type=individual \\   --data-urlencode email=\"jenny.rosen@example.com\" \\  -d \"individual[first_name]\"=Jenny \\  -d \"individual[last_name]\"=Rosen \\   --data-urlencode \"individual[email]\"=\"jenny.rosen@example.com\" \\  -d \"individual[address][line1]\"=\"354 Oyster Point Blvd\" \\  -d \"individual[address][city]\"=\"South San Francisco\" \\  -d \"individual[address][state]\"=CA \\  -d \"individual[address][postal_code]\"=94080 \\  -d external_account=  {{BANK_ACCOUNT_TOKEN_ID}}`\n\nAfter the connected account completes onboarding through the Account Onboarding embedded component, your platform can no longer update certain information such as payout accounts or legal entity information. The connected account must make any updates to that information because the platform isn’t responsible for negative balances.\n\n### Onboard users through the embedded onboarding component![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nConnected accounts must go through onboarding and provide required information to enable charges and payouts. To onboard a connected account, host the [onboarding embedded component](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/supported-embedded-components/account-onboarding) on your site and direct new accounts there.\n\n### Create an Account Session![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nWhen [creating an Account Session](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-connect-embedded-components), enable account management by specifying `account_onboarding` in the `components` parameter.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/account_sessions \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d account=  {{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}   \\  -d \"components[account_onboarding][enabled]\"=true \\  -d \"components[account_onboarding][features][external_account_collection]\"=true`\n\nAfter creating the Account Session and initializing ConnectJS, you can render the Account onboarding component in the front end:\n\n`// Include this element in your HTML const accountOnboarding = stripeConnectInstance.create('account-onboarding'); accountOnboarding.setOnExit(() => {   console.log('User exited the onboarding flow'); }); container.appendChild(accountOnboarding);`\n\nPresent the onboarding flow to the account’s primary owner. The primary owner sets up authentication with Stripe, and is the user who can edit the account details and respond to risk interventions. The connected account has only a single set of authentication credentials with Stripe. The user with authentication credentials can authenticate using one-time SMS codes to perform more sensitive actions like updating bank accounts for payout destinations or providing updated legal entity information.\n\n### Listen for onboarding events![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nAs the account proceeds through onboarding, [account.updated](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-account.updated) events are also sent to your configured [Connect webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/webhooks). When the account finishes submitting their details, the `details_submitted` field on the Account changes to true. Check the status by looking for `details_submitted: true` in the `account.updated` event body in your webhook handler or by [retrieving the Account](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account/retrieve). If `details_submitted` is false, show the embedded onboarding component again. If the account submitted some information, the embedded onboarding component skips it and only collects the unsubmitted requirements.\n\nWhen a connected account submits their details and completes the onboarding flow, the embedded onboarding component calls the `onExit` handler that you [set when you render the component](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/supported-embedded-components/account-onboarding). Use the callback to direct the account to their next action. If you don’t set an exit handler, or take action inside of the handler, the account sees a completion message without a clear next step.\n\n### Request additional capabilities (optional)![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYour platform can continue to request additional [capabilities](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-capabilities) after onboarding a connected account. For example, you must request the capabilities for any payment methods you want to enable for an account.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/accounts/`\n\n`{{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}`\n\n `\\  -u \"  sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc  :\" \\  -d \"capabilities[bancontact_payments][requested]\"=true \\  -d \"capabilities[eps_payments][requested]\"=true \\  -d \"capabilities[giropay_payments][requested]\"=true \\  -d \"capabilities[ideal_payments][requested]\"=true \\  -d \"capabilities[p24_payments][requested]\"=true \\  -d \"capabilities[sofort_payments][requested]\"=true \\  -d \"capabilities[sepa_debit_payments][requested]\"=true`\n\nIf any requested capabilities require additional information, the connected account receives a notification through the [embedded notification banner](#embed-the-notification-banner).\n\n[\n\n## Handle ongoing compliance and risk updates![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n\n\n](#handle-compliance-and-risk-updates)\n\nBecause Stripe manages credit and fraud risk for your connected accounts, your accounts must be able to see and respond to alerts from Stripe. To facilitate that, your platform must integrate the notification banner and account management embedded components. For more information about how Stripe supports your connected accounts through these components, see [Embedded Connect support](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/embedded-support).\n\nStripe uses the [notification banner embedded component](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/supported-embedded-components/notification-banner) to notify connected accounts of outstanding compliance requirements and other [risk-related requests](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/embedded-risk). Responding to these notifications allows an account to remain compliant so it can process payments and receive payouts. If there are no outstanding notifications, the embedded notification banner doesn’t render.\n\nIntegrate the notification banner in a highly visible and easily accessible location on your website. For example, you can integrate it at the top of your payments page.\n\n### Create an Account Session ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nWhen [creating an Account Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_sessions/create), enable notification banner by specifying `notification_banner` in the `components` parameter.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/account_sessions \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d account=  {{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}   \\  -d \"components[notification_banner][enabled]\"=true \\  -d \"components[notification_banner][features][external_account_collection]\"=true`\n\n`// Include this element in your HTML const notificationBanner = stripeConnectInstance.create('notification-banner'); container.appendChild(notificationBanner);  // Optional: // notificationBanner.setCollectionOptions({ //   fields: 'eventually_due', //   futureRequirements: 'include', // })`\n\nTo respond to a banner notification, the account can click a button in the notification. You don’t need to redirect them to the account management embedded component.\n\n## Embed account management![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nStripe requires the [account management embedded component](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/supported-embedded-components/account-management) when managing risk. Integrate the component in your website where an account updates their settings or profile.\n\n### Create an Account Session![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nWhen [creating an Account Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_sessions/create), enable account management by specifying `account_management` in the `components` parameter.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/account_sessions \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d account=  {{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}   \\  -d \"components[account_management][enabled]\"=true \\  -d \"components[account_management][features][external_account_collection]\"=true`\n\n### Render the account management component![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n`// Include this element in your HTML const accountManagement = stripeConnectInstance.create('account-management'); container.appendChild(accountManagement);  // Optional: // accountManagement.setCollectionOptions({ //   fields: 'eventually_due', //   futureRequirements: 'include', // })`\n\nThis component allows an account to update their account details, respond to compliance requirements that are due, and update their authentication credentials.\n\n[](#integrate-payments)\n\nSet up the payments integration after integrating required embedded components. You can add the payments and payout embedded components to your platform or build your own workflows.\n\nConfigure [Connect webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/webhooks) and listen for the `account.updated` event. A connected account is ready to receive payments when its `charges_enabled` property is true.\n\n## Integrate embedded payments and payouts ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nAdd the [payments](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/supported-embedded-components/payments) and [payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/supported-embedded-components/payouts) embedded components to your platform _before_ building your payments integration. That way, an account can easily access and manage their core payment workflows.\n\nThe payments component shows a list of the connected account’s payments, and includes filtering and individual payment detail views. An account can issue refunds and respond to disputes with evidence on individual payments through this component.\n\n### Create an Account Session![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nWhen [creating an Account Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_sessions/create), enable the payments embedded component by specifying `payments` in the `components` parameter. You can turn on or off an individual feature of the payments component by specifying the `features` parameter under `payments`:\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/account_sessions \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d account=  {{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}   \\  -d \"components[payments][enabled]\"=true \\  -d \"components[payments][features][refund_management]\"=true \\  -d \"components[payments][features][dispute_management]\"=true \\  -d \"components[payments][features][capture_payments]\"=true \\  -d \"components[payments][features][destination_on_behalf_of_charge_management]\"=false`\n\nYour connected accounts can view the complete set of information about direct charges. They can also manage refunds, manage disputes, and capture payments if you enable the corresponding features when creating an account session.\n\n### Render the payments component![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nAfter creating the account session and [initializing ConnectJS](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-connect-embedded-components#account-sessions), you can render the payments component in the front end:\n\n`// Include this element in your HTML const payments = stripeConnectInstance.create('payments'); container.appendChild(payments);`\n\nThe payouts component shows the connected account’s recent payouts, current balance, and when funds will become available.\n\nWhen [creating an Account Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_sessions/create), enable the payouts embedded component by specifying `payouts` in the `components` parameter. You can enable or disable individual features of the payouts component by specifying the `features` parameter under `payouts`:\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/account_sessions \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d account=  {{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}   \\  -d \"components[payouts][enabled]\"=true \\  -d \"components[payouts][features][instant_payouts]\"=true \\  -d \"components[payouts][features][standard_payouts]\"=true \\  -d \"components[payouts][features][edit_payout_schedule]\"=true \\  -d \"components[payouts][features][external_account_collection]\"=true`\n\nAfter creating the account session and [initializing ConnectJS](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-connect-embedded-components#account-sessions), you can render the payouts component in the front end:\n\n`// Include this element in your HTML const payouts = stripeConnectInstance.create('payouts'); container.appendChild(payouts);`\n\nFor an immersive guide to implementing embedded components, follow the [Connect embedded components integration quickstart](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/connect-embedded-components/quickstart).\n\n## Accept a payment![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nIf your connected accounts transact directly with customers, Stripe strongly recommends using [direct charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges).\n\nStripe assesses payment transaction fees to your platform when `controller.fees.payer` is not set to `account` for the [Account](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object). In turn, you’re responsible for charging payment processing fees on your connected accounts. You can specify a value for the [application fee](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges#collect-fees) on each payment to automatically take fees from connected accounts without having to build it into your integration.\n\nWe recommend using [Stripe Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout), a prebuilt Stripe-hosted page, to accept payments. Checkout supports multiple payment methods and automatically shows the most relevant ones to your customer.\n\nYou can also use the [Payment Element](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-element), a prebuilt UI component you can embed to accept additional payment methods with a single integration.\n\n### Create a Checkout Session Client-side Server-side![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nA Checkout Session controls what a customer sees in the Stripe-hosted payment page such as line items, the order amount and currency, and acceptable payment methods. When performing direct charges, Checkout uses the connected account’s branding settings. For more information, see [Customize branding](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges?platform=web&ui=stripe-hosted#branding).\n\nUnlike destination charges or separate charges and transfers, connected accounts are responsible for handling disputes on direct charges—it’s not the responsibility of the platform.\n\nTo create a Checkout Session, add a checkout button to your website that calls a server-side endpoint.\n\n`<html>   <head>     <title>Checkout</title>   </head>   <body>     <form action=\"/create-checkout-session\" method=\"POST\">       <button type=\"submit\">Pay</button>     </form>   </body> </html>`\n\nOn your server, make the following call to the Stripe API. After creating a Checkout Session, redirect your customer to the [URL](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/object#checkout_session_object-url) returned in the response.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/checkout/sessions \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -H \"Stripe-Account:   {{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}  \" \\  -d mode=payment \\  -d \"line_items[0][price]\"=  {{PRICE_ID}}   \\  -d \"line_items[0][quantity]\"=1 \\  -d \"payment_intent_data[application_fee_amount]\"=123 \\   --data-urlencode success_url=\"[https://example.com/success](https://example.com/success)\" \\   --data-urlencode cancel_url=\"[https://example.com/cancel](https://example.com/cancel)\"`\n\n*   `line_items`—Represents items that your customer is purchasing and that show up in the hosted user interface.\n*   `success_url`—This argument redirects a customer after they complete a payment.\n*   `cancel_url`—This argument redirects a customer after they click **cancel**.\n*   `Stripe-Account`—This header indicates a [direct charge](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges) for your connected account. With direct charges, the connected account is responsible for Stripe fees, refunds, and chargebacks. Checkout uses the connected account’s branding, which allows their customers to feel like they’re interacting directly with the connected account instead of your platform.\n*   _(Optional)_ `payment_intent_data[application_fee_amount]`—This argument specifies the amount your platform plans to take from the transaction. After the payment is processed on the connected account, the `application_fee_amount` is transferred to the platform and the Stripe fee is deducted from the connected account’s balance.\n\n### Handle post-payment events Server-side![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nStripe sends a [checkout.session.completed](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-checkout.session.completed) event when the payment completes. [Use a webhook to receive these events](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks/quickstart) and run actions, like sending an order confirmation email to your customer, logging the sale in a database, or starting a shipping workflow.\n\nListen for these events rather than waiting on a callback from the client. On the client, the customer could close the browser window or quit the app before the callback executes. Some payment methods also take 2-14 days for payment confirmation. Setting up your integration to listen for asynchronous events enables you to accept multiple [payment methods](https://stripe.com/payments/payment-methods-guide) with a single integration.\n\nIn addition to handling the `checkout.session.completed` event, we recommend handling two other events when collecting payments with Checkout:\n\nThese events all include the [Checkout Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions) object. After the payment succeeds, the underlying [PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents \"Payment Intents API\") status changes from `processing` to `succeeded`.\n\n[](#setup-email-communications)\n\nStripe communicates with your connected accounts on your behalf to manage risk and ensure ongoing compliance. You can customize and brand these email communications with your own email domain and platform branding.\n\nWe send the following emails to your connected accounts:\n\n*   **Account emails** verify an account’s information, such as additions or changes to an email address, phone number, or bank account.\n*   **Compliance emails** notify accounts to provide required information. Stripe often needs to collect further information to maintain compliance with our financial partners.\n*   **Risk emails** notify accounts when they are under a risk review. These emails often provide instructions on how to submit information to resolve a risk action; for example, to remove a pause on payouts.\n*   **Tax emails** (only when Stripe collects Stripe fees directly from connected accounts) notify users when their tax invoices or 1099s are ready to download.\n\nIf you want to send any other payments-related emails to your connected accounts, you must send them yourself. For example, to send emails for new disputes, [listen for](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks) the `charge.dispute.created` event on a connected account. When that event occurs, use [the Disputes API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/disputes) to get the details and email them to the account.\n\nYou must [update your Connect settings with the URLs](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect/site-links) of your payments and account workflows so Stripe’s email communications can include links for your accounts to respond.\n\n## Handle redirects from email links![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nEmails sent by Stripe that contain a call to action need to include a link to that action. For example, if we send an email directing action on a connected account, it must include a link to your Account management component.\n\nBefore you can create a live mode Account Session, you must provide the URLs where you have integrated the embedded components into your website. Configure the sending email domain and embedded component URLs in the **Site links** section of [your platform’s Connect settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect/embedded_ui).\n\n#### Note\n\nTest mode environments use the same URLs as live mode.\n\nFor embedded components integrated in your site, select **Yes** and enter the URL of the page that hosts the component. For any actions not handled by an embedded component, select **No** and enter the URL of the page on your site where the account can perform the action. After entering the URLs, test them to verify that they open the right pages.\n\nYou must set URLs for the following:\n\n*   Notification banner\n*   Account management\n*   Payments\n*   Payouts\n*   Balances\n*   Documents (when Stripe collects Stripe fees directly from connected accounts)\n\nWhen sending an email, Stripe automatically appends the connected account ID to the redirect URL as the `stripe_account_id` parameter. Use that parameter to identify the account and verify that they’re authenticated. Set up the route on your server to read the parameters and display the correct embedded component.\n\nFor more information about configuring Stripe emails to your connected accounts, see [Email communications in embedded Connect integrations](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/embedded-comms)\n\n## Configure email branding and settings ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nStripe can send emails reflecting your platform’s brand settings from your own email domain to your connected accounts. To configure Stripe emails to your connected accounts, visit [Emails](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect/emails) in your platform Dashboard.\n\n[](#go-live)\n\nAt this point, you’ve configured your platform integration by doing the following:\n\n*   Created connected accounts in the correct configuration\n*   Integrated embedded components to allow connected accounts to onboard, manage their account, and respond to risk actions through your website\n*   Set up payments using Direct charges with an application fee\n*   Set up branded email communications to enable Stripe to communicate with your users for compliance, risk actions, and necessary documents\n\n## Test your integration![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nTest your account creation flow by using the embedded account onboarding integrated in your platform. Test the settings of your payment methods for your connected accounts by logging into one of your test accounts and navigating to the [Payment methods settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods). Test your checkout flow with your test keys and a test account. You can use our [test cards](https://docs.stripe.com/testing) to test your payments flow and simulate various payment outcomes.",

In addition to the totals, a 1099 form also needs to have the name, address, and TIN of the connected account on the form to be ready for filing.\n\nIf a form is above the threshold (has a filing obligation) and has the **name**, **address**, and **TIN** on the form, Stripe labels the form `Ready`:\n\n![Ready label.](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/identity_1.7c55d26b4ecfd38740e2de9acd0ff5b3.png)\n\nIf you need to file a form but the form is missing this key information, Stripe labels the form `Needs attention`:\n\n![Needs attention label.](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/identity_2.c7b46cd05ee19f79cc1f7a4c19a205f5.png)\n\nRefer to the [Get started with tax reporting](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-tax-reporting#understand-tax-form-status) guide to learn more about tax form statuses.\n\nThe following information describes how to track what forms have `Needs attention` status, why they have that status, and what to do to get their status to `Ready`.\n\n## Identity forms in `Needs attention` state![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe **Needs attention** tab lists all forms with a `Needs attention` status.\n\n![Needs attention tab.](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/identity_3.0ec06ddc52465f44465ff9c5a22057b0.png)\n\n#### Note\n\nSome forms that appear to be below the federal filing threshold can also appear as `Ready` or `Needs attention` due to Grouped TINs or state filing thresholds. [Learn more](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/file-tax-forms#below-threshold-forms)\n\nThe **Payee details** section lists the missing data that causes the form to have a `Needs attention` status:\n\n![Payee details section.](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/identity_4.bd8c5d5254cb44977f15b2f84d494a14.png)\n\nRefer to the [Required verification information for taxes](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information-taxes) guide for information on what information is needed for each form.\n\nThe reasons a form might have a `Needs attention` status include:\n\n*   **Missing address:** The _line1_, _city_, _state,_ or _postal code_ is missing.\n*   **Missing TIN:** The TIN is missing.\n*   **Mismatched TIN:** The name and TIN are present on the form, but failed Stripe’s TIN verification with the IRS as they didn’t match IRS records. [Learn more about Tax form TIN status](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-tax-reporting#understand-tax-form-tin-status).\n*   **Missing name:** The name is missing from the account. This reason is rare.\n\nUse the filter to retrieve forms based on the reason for the `Needs attention` status:\n\n![Filter forms by status](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/identity_5.9cd7b0b5fff7639007ae9e507504d00f.png)\n\nThere are several ways to fix forms that need attention.\n\n[](#scenario-a)\n\nThese are your options if you already have this data or able to retrieve it outside of Stripe.\n\n*   **Option 1 Recommended:** If you already have this data in your internal systems, or have a way to reach out to your connected account owners to collect this information directly, use the [Accounts API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/update) to send that data to Stripe. Make sure these required [fields](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information-taxes) are present on the Accounts API. After you send the data to Stripe, it appears in the tax form within 24-36 hours, and the form automatically transitions from `Needs attention` to `Ready`.\n*   **Option 2:** Use [CSV imports](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/modify-tax-forms?method=csv) to get this data into the current year’s tax forms. If the CSV process imports all of the required information, the tax form automatically transitions from `Needs attention` to `Ready`. Importing these details using CSV only updates this information on the tax form, and doesn’t update the source of truth within Stripe. As a result, the connected account details view doesn’t show these updates.\n*   **Option 3**: If you need to update only a few forms, you can choose to directly modify the forms in the Dashboard using the [Tax Form Editor](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/modify-tax-forms?method=dashboard).\n\n[](#scenario-b)\n\nThese are your options if you don’t have the required information and you want Stripe to help you obtain this data. Stripe recommends using both options to for the best chance of collecting all the information for filing.\n\n*   **Option 1:** If you enable e-delivery through Stripe Express, connected account owners eligible for IRS filing receive emails from Stripe requesting confirmation of their tax information and to update their delivery preferences through Stripe Express. Connected account owners have an opportunity to [view and edit their personal details](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/platform-express-dashboard-taxes-walkthrough) (name, address, TIN).\n    \n    ![Tax form confirm information email.](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/tax-form-confirm-information-email-2023.8868bb92bbd3f2fd5fa0e2fe319c11ab.png)\n    \n    ![Confirm information.](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/identity_7.1801e85e31759f80b4e3ffd7fe974778.png)\n    \n*   **Option 2:** Use Stripe Onboarding to collect missing details\n    \n    1.  Add the 1099 capability on your accounts [programmatically](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-capabilities#tax-reporting) or [one-by-one](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/dashboard/managing-individual-accounts#updating-capabilities) using the Connect Dashboard. By adding the 1099 capability, you make name, address, and TIN a requirement on all your connected accounts. If your connected accounts have more than 600 USD in lifetime volume and don’t have name, address, and verified TIN on file, payouts are paused until Stripe has that information.\n        *   There’s another feature in private beta called Additional Verifications that allows platforms to add TIN and address requirements on their connected accounts, along with flexibility on when to disable payouts. Reach out to your account manager if you’d like to learn more.\n    2.  Create [account links](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_links/create) and route your users to Stripe onboarding for Custom accounts. For Express accounts, Stripe automatically detects when there are `currently_due` requirements (such as address or TIN) on the account and sends the connected account owner an email.\n    \n    ![Verify your personal details.](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/identity_8.1dc79629776f61a43b06d68a583d6aa4.png)",

Tax forms are available on the [Tax reporting](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/taxes/forms) page in the Dashboard. If you need to update or correct a 1099 form, you can do so in one of the following ways:\n\nYou can also create new tax forms by importing CSV files. If your connected account doesn’t already have a tax form, performing Update or Delta imports automatically creates the form.\n\nClick **Create** to create a standalone tax form that isn’t associated with a connected account. You must include all columns except for `form_id` and `stripe_account_id`. E-delivery isn’t available for standalone forms (only postal mailing is allowed for delivery). If you’re creating a standalone form of a non-default form type, you must include the CSV headers of that form type. If you need assistance getting the correct CSV headers, reach out to support@stripe.com.\n\nYou can update the values for payee details and payment amounts in a 1099 tax form using the Tax form editor in the Dashboard. After you update the values, you can generate a new or corrected form with updated values.\n\n## Understanding the tax form editor UI![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nWhen you open a record from the **Tax reporting** page, it includes the following sections:\n\n*   **Payee details**\\-Includes details about the owner of the connected account that you pay out to.\n*   **Totals**\\-Includes the payment detail totals form.\n*   **Forms details**\\-Includes details about delivery and filing status.\n*   **Form timeline**\\-Includes a log of corrections to the tax form. It doesn’t log changes made to the form by exporting the form to a CSV file and then importing an updated CSV file with new values.\n\nYou can modify values in the **Payee details**, **Totals**, and **Forms details** sections.\n\n#### Note\n\nWhen you update the values of a 1099 tax form it updates only the data on the form, not the data in the connected account.\n\n#### Warning\n\nEditing the **Payee details** or **Totals** data on a form during the form’s tax year will disable automatic updates to those fields by Stripe. You can always undo your edits to resume automatic updates later.\n\n**To update a 1099 tax form before filing**\n\n1.  On the **Tax reporting** page, click the tax form to update.\n2.  Click **Edit**.\n3.  To update the user details on the 1099 form, such as **Name**, **TIN**, or **Address**, expand **Payee details** and then update the value for each field as appropriate.\n4.  To update details related to payments and withholdings on the 1099 form, expand **Totals**, and then update the values as appropriate.\n5.  Click **Save** to save your changes.\n\nYou can then download the updated form as a PDF document.\n\nWhen you save the form, Stripe validates the format of the values you entered. For example, If you provide a TIN that doesn’t include the correct number of digits, Stripe displays an error message. Stripe doesn’t verify that the TIN is the correct TIN for the connected account, only that it includes the correct number of digits.\n\n## Correcting a tax form after filing![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nIn some cases, you need to correct the values in a 1099 tax form after you file it. If you try to update a tax form that you already filed, you see a **Correct** button instead of an **Edit** button in the form.\n\n#### Note\n\nYou can’t create a corrected 1099 form for a connected account if you already filed it and the status for the filed form is `Processing` or `Rejected`. If you need to update a form that is `Processing` or `Rejected`, contact [Stripe support](https://support.stripe.com/contact) for assistance.\n\n**To correct a 1099 tax form after filing**\n\n#### Warning\n\nThe IRS allows you to submit a correction to either the **Payee details** or **Totals** data, but not both at the same time. Correct only one set of data for a correction.\n\n1.  On the **Tax reporting** page, click the tax form to correct.\n2.  Click **Correct**.\n3.  To correct the user details on the 1099 form, such as **Name**, **TIN**, or **Address**, expand **Payee details** and then correct the value for each field as appropriate.\n4.  To correct details related to payments and withholdings on the 1099 form, expand **Totals** and then correct the values as appropriate.\n5.  Click **Save** to save your changes.\n\nYou can then [file](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/file-tax-forms) the corrected form and download a PDF copy for your records.\n\n## Quick Correct: Payee Details![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nWhen the payee details for a connected account don’t match the values on a tax form for the connected account, a pencil icon appears next to **Payee details**. Hovering over the pencil shows a tool tip listing the information that doesn’t match. Click the pencil icon, then click **Correct** to automatically generate a corrected form in which the payee details match those of the connected account.\n\nWhen you click **Correct**, Stripe generates a new form with the updated payee information from the connected account **Payee details**. If there is an existing corrected form that wasn’t yet filed, the corrected form is updated with the information from the connected account. A corrected form includes all payee details that don’t match, such as payee name, address, and TIN. If more than one value is updated, the corrected form updates all mismatched fields.\n\nWhen you click **Correct** to update the values in the tax form, it updates all values that are different in the connected account than the tax form. You can’t choose which fields to update values for. You should verify all changes before filing the updated forms. If a connected account user made a typo to their address, the incorrect address is updated in the corrected form. You can choose to change a single value in an updated tax form by using CSV export to export the file to correct. To learn more, see [Correct tax forms](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/correct-tax-forms).\n\nYou can use **Quick Correct** to update details only in tax forms that you have already filed and contain a mismatch between the tax form data and the data in the connected account. When no mismatched data is detected, the pencil icon does not display. If there is a pencil icon displayed to indicate a mismatch in the data because the connected account data is missing, the pencil icon is displayed but the **Correct** button is deactivated.\n\nIn the **Quick Correct** panel you can view all of the payee details except for the TIN, which is partially redacted.\n\nYou can add a **Payee details** filter with a value of `Payee has updated identity info` to see only the list of forms with identity values that differ between the connected account and the form, which are the only forms eligible for **Quick Correct**.\n\n![Payee details filter](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/payee_details.cf41cd76412580985136ccbf38ba8d25.png)\n\n## Revert: Payee Details & Totals![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nWhen the data for **Payee details** or **Totals** doesn’t match the values on a tax form for the connected account, an Edited badge appears next to the section. Hovering over the badge shows a tool tip listing the values that don’t match. Click the **Undo edits** button to automatically revert the tax form to match the data in the connected account.\n\nThe difference between **Revert** and **Quick Correct** is that you can Revert details on a form when it hasn’t been filed yet, and you can Quick Correct a form after it has been filed. When you click Revert, all mismatched data is updated. You can’t choose which fields to update and exclude others. If there is data missing from the connected account, the Revert button is deactivated.\n\n![Revert details](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/revert_details.be237e4cac5598ce9708f7260e7988db.png)\n\n## Updating or correcting a 1099 tax form after filing using connected account data![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nIf data for a connected account changes after Stripe generates 1099 forms, you can use the editor in the Dashboard to quickly replace data in the 1099 with data from the connected account. Stripe displays a bell icon in the **Payee details** section when the data in the form is different from the data in the connected account.\n\n**To update or correct a tax form after filing using connected account data**\n\n1.  On the **Tax reporting** page, click the tax form to correct.\n2.  Click the bell icon to display the data from the connected account.\n3.

  "markdown": "# Account capabilities | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Learn about capabilities you can enable for accounts and the requirements you must satisfy to use them.\n\nThe capabilities you request for a connected account determine the information you need to collect for that account. To reduce onboarding effort, only request the capabilities you need. The more capabilities you request, the more information you must collect.\n\nYou can start by completing the [platform profile](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/profile) to understand which capabilities might be appropriate for your platform.\n\n#### Note\n\nFor some capabilities, requesting them enables them permanently. Attempting to remove or unrequest a permanent capability returns an error.\n\nAfter creating most accounts, you can request additional capabilities and remove existing non-permanent capabilities. However, you can’t unrequest capabilities for connected accounts that other platforms control.\n\n## Supported capabilities ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nFollowing is a list of available capabilities. Click an item to expand or collapse it.\n\n### Transfers![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n### Card payments![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n### US tax reporting![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n### Payment methods![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n### India international payments![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n## Multiple capabilities ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nRequesting multiple capabilities for a connected account is common, but involves the following considerations:\n\n*   Capabilities operate independently of each other.\n*   If a connected account has both `card_payments` and `transfers`, and the `status` of either one is `inactive`, then both capabilities are disabled.\n*   You can request or unrequest a capability for a connected account at any time during the account’s lifecycle.\n\nCapabilities also allow you to collect information for multiple purposes at the same time. For example, you can collect both required tax information and the information required for a requested capability. If you’re onboarding a connected account with the `transfers` capability and they’re required to file an IRS form 1099-MISC (a US federal tax reporting form), you can collect information for both at the same time.\n\n## Create an account with capabilities ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nCapabilities are set on the [Account](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object) object. To get the list of available capabilities for an Account, use the [list\\_capabilities](https://docs.stripe.com/api/capabilities/list?lang=curl) endpoint.\n\nAccount creation and requesting capabilities differ for connected accounts in different configurations.\n\n*   Setting up connected accounts with access to the full Stripe Dashboard, including Standard accounts, automatically requests capabilities for them.\n*   For connected accounts with access to the Express Dashboard, including Express accounts, you can either request their capabilities or use the [onboarding configuration settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect/onboarding-options/countries) to automate capability requests.\n*   For connected accounts without access to a Stripe-hosted dashboard, including Custom accounts, you must request their capabilities.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/accounts \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d country=US \\  -d type=custom \\  -d \"capabilities[card_payments][requested]\"=true \\  -d \"capabilities[transfers][requested]\"=true`\n\nInformation requirements vary depending on the capability, but they often relate to identity verification or other information specific to a payment type.\n\nWhen your connected account is successfully created, you can [retrieve a list](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/retrieve) of its requirements:\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/accounts/`\n\n`{{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}`\n\n `\\  -u \"  sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc  :\"`\n\nIn the response, the `requirements` hash specifies the required information. The values for `payouts_enabled` and `charges_enabled` indicate whether payouts and charges are enabled for the account.\n\n## Capabilities for existing connected accounts ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nThe following sections describe how to preview information requirements or manage capabilities for existing connected accounts using the [Capabilities API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/capabilities).\n\n### Preview information requirements ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nYou can preview what information is needed from your connected account for a particular capability either before or after that capability has been requested.\n\nWhen you request capabilities, `account.updated` [webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks \"webhook\") fire and the account’s requirements can change. To enable a requirement faster and avoid disabling the account, preview the requirements and collect any required information before requesting the capability.\n\nThe following example [lists](https://docs.stripe.com/api/capabilities/retrieve) the requirements for the `card_payments` capability for a specific account.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/accounts/`\n\n`{{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}`\n\n`/capabilities/card_payments \\  -u \"  sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc  :\"`\n\nIn the response, check the `requirements` hash to see what information is needed:\n\n`{   \"id\": \"card_payments\",   \"object\": \"capability\",   \"account\":` \n\n`\"{{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}\"`\n\n`,   \"requested\": false,   \"requested_at\": null,   \"requirements\": {     \"past_due\": [],     \"currently_due\": [\"company.tax_id\", ...],     \"eventually_due\": [...],     \"disabled_reason\": ...,     \"current_deadline\": ...,   },   \"status\": \"unrequested\" }`\n\nThe value for `status` identifies whether the capability has been requested. When the value is [requested](#requesting-unrequesting), the account’s requirements are active.\n\nIn addition to previewing a capability’s requirements before requesting it, you can use the same endpoint to view a capability’s current requirements. That can help you stay informed when requirements change.\n\n### Request and unrequest capabilities ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nTo request a capability for an account, set the capability’s `requested` value to `true` by [updating the account](https://docs.stripe.com/api/capabilities/update). If the request succeeds, the API returns `requested: true` in the response.\n\nTo unrequest a capability for an account, set the capability’s `requested` value to `false` by [updating the account](https://docs.stripe.com/api/capabilities/update). If the capability can’t be removed, the call returns an error. If the call succeeds, the API returns `requested: false` in the response.\n\nYou can also [request and remove an account’s capabilities](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/dashboard/managing-individual-accounts#updating-capabilities) from the Dashboard. If a capability can’t be removed, its **Remove** button is disabled.\n\nThe example below requests the `transfers` capability for a specific connected account:\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/accounts/`\n\n`{{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}`\n\n`/capabilities/transfers \\  -u \"  sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc  :\" \\  -d requested=true`\n\nThe example below requests multiple capabilities for a specific connected account:\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/accounts/`\n\n`{{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}`\n\n `\\  -u \"  sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc  :\" \\  -d \"capabilities[bancontact_payments][requested]\"=true \\  -d \"capabilities[eps_payments][requested]\"=true \\  -d \"capabilities[giropay_payments][requested]\"=true \\  -d \"capabilities[ideal_payments][requested]\"=true \\  -d \"capabilities[p24_payments][requested]\"=true \\  -d \"capabilities[sofort_payments][requested]\"=true \\  -d \"capabilities[sepa_debit_payments][requested]\"=true`",

After the connected account’s service agreement is accepted, the type of service agreement can’t be modified.\n\n### Full service agreement ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nA `full` service agreement creates a service relationship between Stripe and the connected account holder. Connected accounts under the `full` service agreement can process card payments and request the [card\\_payments](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-capabilities#card-payments) capability.\n\nFor the legal language, see the [Stripe Connected Account Agreement](https://stripe.com/connect-account/legal/full).\n\n### Recipient service agreement ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nA `recipient` service agreement clarifies that there is no service relationship between Stripe and the recipient, and that the recipient’s relationship is with the platform. Connected accounts under the recipient service agreement can’t process payments or request the `card_payments` capability.\n\nTransfers to `recipient` accounts take an extra 24 hours to become available in the connected account’s balance. To learn more about `pending` balances, see the [account balances](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-balances) page.\n\n[Cross-border payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/cross-border-payouts) only work with accounts under the `recipient` service agreement. You must explicitly pass in the country code if it differs from the platform country.\n\nStripe isn’t responsible for providing direct support for accounts on the `recipient` service agreement. However, the platform can reach out to Stripe for support for these accounts.\n\nFor the legal language, see the [Stripe Recipient Agreement](https://stripe.com/connect-account/legal/recipient).\n\n## Choosing the agreement type ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nYou can specify the agreement type through the [Accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts) API.\n\n### Accounts API ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nTo choose a `recipient` service agreement when [creating an account](https://docs.stripe.com/api#create_account), specify the agreement type with [tos\\_acceptance\\[service\\_agreement\\]](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-tos_acceptance):\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/accounts \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d country=US \\  -d \"controller[stripe_dashboard][type]\"=none \\  -d \"controller[fees][payer]\"=application \\  -d \"controller[losses][payments]\"=application \\  -d \"controller[requirement_collection]\"=application \\  -d \"capabilities[transfers][requested]\"=true \\  -d \"tos_acceptance[service_agreement]\"=recipient`\n\nThe same principle applies when [updating an account](https://docs.stripe.com/api#update_account):\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/accounts/`\n\n`{{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}`\n\n `\\  -u \"  sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc  :\" \\  -d \"tos_acceptance[service_agreement]\"=recipient`\n\n#### Caution\n\nChanging the service agreement type fails if the service agreement has already been accepted; in those cases, create a new account with the desired service agreement.\n\n### Connect Configuration settings![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nTo choose a `recipient` service agreement for connected accounts with access to the Express Dashboard, select the **Transfers** option with the **Restricted Capability Access** icon in the [Configuration settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/applications/settings/express) section of the Stripe Dashboard.\n\nYou can override the Configuration settings for an individual account by specifying its capabilities and service agreement type with the Accounts API.\n\n## Accepting the correct agreement![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nStripe handles the service agreement acceptance if you use [Stripe-hosted onboarding](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/hosted-onboarding) or [Embedded onboarding](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/embedded-onboarding).

You can mitigate fraud during onboarding by verifying that information, such as the name and address of the external bank account holder.\n\nFinancial Connections is free when you include Link. Otherwise, using it [incurs fees](https://stripe.com/financial-connections#pricing).\n\nAlternatively, if you use API onboarding for your connected accounts, you can collect payout account details with a custom form in your account onboarding flow.\n\n[Stripe-hosted onboarding for connected accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom/hosted-onboarding) uses a web form hosted by Stripe to collect the information required to onboard connected accounts.

You can edit this property on accounts where you [own fraud and dispute liability](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/accounts).\n\nThis field is useful for dictating automatic payouts. Stripe calculates the delay in business days or calendar days based on the [connected accounts’ country](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts#standard-payout-timing). For example, if you want a connected account based in Singapore (which uses calendar day delays) to receive their funds two weeks after the charge is made, set `interval` to `daily` and `delay_days` to **14**. When setting or updating this field, you can pass the string `minimum` to choose the lowest permitted value.\n\nFor accounts where Stripe manages fraud and dispute liability (for example, Standard accounts), the default is the lowest permitted value for the account, determined by the [connected account’s country](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts#standard-payout-timing). If you’re opted into [accelerated payout speeds](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts#accelerated-payout-speeds), the value uses the accelerated timing. You can request to lower this by contacting [Stripe Support](https://support.stripe.com/contact). For accounts where you own fraud and dispute liability, the value remains at your original payout speed by default.\n\n### Interval property![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nPlatforms that manage fraud and dispute liability, or have [platform controls](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/platform-controls-for-stripe-dashboard-accounts#control-payout-timing), can adjust the payout interval. There are four possible settings for the `interval` property:\n\n*   **manual**: This setting prevents automatic payouts. You will have to manually pay out the account’s balance using the [Payouts API](https://docs.stripe.com/api#create_payout) (acting as the connected account). You also set an account to `manual` to use [Instant Payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/instant-payouts).\n*   **daily**: This setting automatically pays out charges `delay_days` days after they’re created. The `delay_days` value can’t be less than your own payout schedule or less than the default payout schedule for the account.\n*   **weekly**: This setting automatically pays out the balance once a week, with the day specified by the `weekly_anchor` parameter (a lower-case weekday such as **monday**).\n*   **monthly**: This setting automatically pays out the balance once a month, as specified by the `monthly_anchor` parameter (a number from 1 to 31). Payouts nominally scheduled between the 29th and 31st of the month are instead sent on the last day of a shorter month.",

  "markdown": "# Using manual payouts | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Send manual payouts to your connected accounts.\n\nIf you set the value of [schedule.interval](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-settings-payouts-schedule) to `manual`, we hold funds in the accountholder’s balance until you specify otherwise. You must pay out the funds within the time period specified below, based on the business’s country:\n\n| Country | Holding Period |\n| --- | --- |\n| Thailand | 10 days |\n| United States | 2 years |\n| All other countries | 90 days |\n\nTo trigger a payout of these funds, use the [Payouts API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payouts/create).\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/accounts/`\n\n`{{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}`\n\n `\\  -u \"  sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc  :\" \\  -d \"settings[payouts][schedule][interval]\"=manual`\n\nThe Payouts API is only for moving funds from a connected Stripe account’s balance into their external account. To move funds between the platform and a connected account, see creating [separate charges and transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers) or creating [destination charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges) through the platform.\n\n#### Note\n\n_Escrow_ has a precise legal definition, and Stripe doesn’t provide escrow services or support escrow accounts. However, you can control payout timing through manual payouts, which allow you to delay payouts to certain accounts. When using manual payouts, you must pay out funds within the time frame for the business’s country.\n\nDelayed payouts can be useful when a delivery is delayed or when there’s a possibility of a refund.\n\n## Regular payouts![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe following example sends 10 USD from a connected account’s Stripe balance to their external account:\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/payouts \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -H \"Stripe-Account:   {{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}  \" \\  -d amount=1000 \\  -d currency=usd`\n\nWith a standard payout, you can move an amount up to the user’s available balance. To find that amount, perform a [retrieve balance](https://docs.stripe.com/api#retrieve_balance) call on their behalf.\n\nStripe tracks balance contributions from different payment sources in separate balances. The retrieve balance response breaks down the components of each balance by source type. For example, to create a payout specifically for a non-credit-card balance, specify the `source_type` in your request.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/payouts \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -H \"Stripe-Account:   {{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}  \" \\  -d amount=24784 \\  -d currency=usd \\  -d source_type=bank_account`\n\nWhile individual balance components can go negative (such as through refunds or chargebacks), you can’t create payouts for greater than the aggregate available balance.",

  "markdown": "# Deliver tax forms with Stripe Express\n\n## Learn how to e-deliver tax forms to connected accounts with the Stripe Express Dashboard.\n\n## How does e-delivery work for connected accounts?![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nStarting with tax season 2021, Stripe enabled e-delivery of tax forms through the Stripe Express Dashboard. Your connected account owners can use the Tax Center on [Stripe Express Dashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/express-dashboard) to manage their tax forms, update their tax information, and manage their tax form delivery preferences. Learn more about working with your users to collect verified tax information for the upcoming tax season in the [1099 Tax Support and Communication Guide](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/platform-express-dashboard-taxes).\n\n#### Note\n\nReview a detailed [product walk-through](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/platform-express-dashboard-taxes-walkthrough) of the Stripe Express dashboard and Stripe outreach to your eligible connected accounts.\n\n## Which connected accounts have access to e-delivery through the Stripe Express Dashboard? ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nE-delivery through the Stripe Express Dashboard is available to connected accounts that already have access to the Express dashboard and accounts where you have built and managed the full experience otherwise.\n\nThere are a few notable exceptions that might affect eligibility for e-delivery. For most platforms, these exceptions include less than 2% of connected accounts.\n\n*   More than five connected accounts tied to a single email, whether each account has the same TIN or different TINs. Stripe continues to deliver forms through paper mail for these accounts.\n*   Payees who don’t have an eligible connected account on Stripe. For example, if you pay someone by check, you can’t deliver their tax form through Stripe Express.\n*   Only current owners receive forms for connected accounts that have been sold or had their businesses transferred prior to receiving their 1099. Previous owners receive paper forms to the address on file if you split the form.\n*   Accounts that haven’t been activated in Stripe yet.\n\nFor the accounts that aren’t eligible for e-delivery, Stripe can support postal deliveries to the address on file.\n\n## When can my connected account owners access the Tax Center on the Stripe Express Dashboard?![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nConnected account owners that currently do not have access but are eligible for it can view the Stripe Express Dashboard and the tax forms page starting in November 2023 after receiving the email invitation from Stripe. This will be triggered if you choose to turn on e-delivery of your tax forms through the Express Dashboard and enable early collection of tax information and delivery preferences under your 1099 tax settings.\n\nCurrently, connected account owners with existing access to the Express Dashboard can edit their tax information. When you opt your platform in to e-delivery, your connected owners see the tax forms page with a row for your platform.\n\n## How do I enable outreach using the Stripe Express Dashboard to collect identity information and e-delivery consent ahead of tax season?![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nCollection of tax identity information and e-delivery consent early in the tax season is critical for enabling a smooth tax season. If your platform opts for e-delivery through the Express Dashboard and enables collection of tax information in advance using 1099 tax form settings, Stripe emails platforms’ connected accounts starting the week of November 1st, 2023 to confirm their tax information and provide e-delivery consent through the Express Dashboard. Note, we don’t send outreach emails to platforms’ connected accounts until _7 days_ after you enable the setting.\n\nThis outreach from Stripe gives connected account owners an opportunity to review and update their tax information and confirm their delivery preferences before you file with the IRS, which maximizes e-delivery opt-in rates, speeds up tax form delivery, and minimizes errors on finalized 1099 forms.\n\nIf you don’t enable collection of tax information in advance and only configure e-delivery, postal delivery initiates at the time you file for any accounts that have not provided e-delivery consent. If accounts provide consent after you file, that consent is applicable only for the next tax year.\n\n## How does a connected account without current access gain access to the Stripe Express Dashboard?![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nConnected account owners that are eligible for access to the Express Dashboard receive an invite from Stripe to confirm their tax information starting in November 2023. These emails include a link to Stripe Express Dashboard Account claims. For connected account owners who’ve never claimed their account and accessed the Stripe Express Dashboard, we first gather their email and phone number to set up their credentials. After that, we present them with a series of identity verification questions (Name, TIN, and DOB) to validate that they do own the account. If they fail these challenges, we provide follow-up questions such as address, Bank Last 4, and last payout amount from the platform to verify their identity. If they fail these questions after multiple attempts, we kick-off a manual review through Stripe Express support.\n\n## Which email address does Stripe use for e-delivery?![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nFor connected accounts that have access to the Express dashboard from onboarding: Stripe already has emails associated with these users that are collected at onboarding. For these accounts, Stripe emails the primary user associated with the account. Multi-user Express Dashboard accounts aren’t supported.\n\nIf an eligible connected account without current access claimed their account on Stripe Express with a valid email address and phone number, the email address they used to sign up is what Stripe uses. Otherwise, Stripe uses the email address on the account.\n\nStripe can’t deliver forms electronically if there is no email address on the account. Instead, Stripe attempts to deliver paper forms if a valid address is on the tax form and you opted in to paper delivery.\n\n## Why do emails need to be updated for connected accounts?![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nIn order for a connected account owner to onboard, log in to the Stripe Express Dashboard, or access their tax forms, they need to be able to receive the email from Stripe inviting them to create their account. If for some reason the user has updated their email, Stripe is only able to resend these emails to the email address on file so they must contact your platform for assistance updating their email.\n\nYou only need to update emails on behalf of the connected account owners before they’ve claimed their accounts. After the owner claims the account, then Stripe is able to assist your users with updating their emails.\n\n## How do I update the email address?![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYou can update the email addresses on your connected accounts in the following ways:\n\n*   Use the [Update](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/update#update_account-email) API.\n*   Use the CSV import functionality on the [Emails page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect/emails) in the Dashboard.\n*   Edit the email addresses in the _Payee Details_ section in the 1099 dashboard.\n\nYou can’t update email addresses using the `email_address` field in a CSV import directly into the 1099 product. Changes made using this method don’t carry over each year.\n\n## How do connected accounts edit their information?![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nAs your connected accounts onboard to the Stripe Express Dashboard, account owners can edit their account details within the Tax reporting page. They are able to edit their name, their TIN, and their address, but they aren’t able to change their date of birth or their entity type. For date of birth and entity updates, account owners need to contact Stripe Support.\n\n## How are tax forms kept in sync between the platform and the connected account?![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe [Tax reporting](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/taxes/forms) view in the Dashboard is still the main place to generate, correct, split, and file 1099s for your connected accounts. Onboarding to the Stripe Express Dashboard integrates the data from the Tax reporting view in the Dashboard directly into the Stripe Express Dashboard if it’s accessible to your connected account owners. Edits made by connected account owners (Name, Social Security Number or Employer Identification Number, address) update your connected accounts and thus the forms in the Tax reporting view in the Dashboard until they are filed. For any updates made by a connected account after the filing date, you are given the choice to either correct the tax form or leave the tax form as is. Updates might take up to 24 hours to sync due to TIN aggregation done by Stripe.\n\nStripe doesn’t share the updated sensitive PII (such as SSN or EIN) from accounts with your platform through the API for security reasons.\n\n## Can I collect consent for e-delivery through the Stripe Express Dashboard?![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYes, the Stripe Express Dashboard can collect e-delivery consent from your connected accounts. Connected accounts can only view their tax forms after providing e-delivery consent. After providing e-delivery consent, connected accounts are provided with the option to request an optional paper copy. You can update the e-delivery consent for an individual form through either the Form Editor UI on the 1099 Dashboard or using a [CSV import](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/modify-tax-forms?method=csv#import-tax-forms) using the ‘e-delivery consent’ field from Jan 2023.\n\n#### Note\n\nConnected accounts are directed to your support team if they would like to revoke e-delivery consent.\n\n## How do connected accounts get alerted when their 1099 forms are available?![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nStripe sends an email notification to your connected accounts when their 1099 forms are available. This email includes both Stripe’s logo and your platform’s logo. The platform logo is taken from your [Connect branding settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect/stripe-dashboard/branding), so please make sure this is up to date before the week of November 1st, 2023.\n\nFor connected accounts where you own the full experience otherwise, make sure that you also [update email addresses](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/update#update_account-email) on the accounts before the week of November 1st, 2023 so Stripe can email them the following week. You can update this information using the Accounts API. Express connected accounts already have a user associated with them, and Stripe emails tax forms to the primary user associated with the account.\n\n## How should I prepare my connected accounts for e-delivery and the upcoming tax season?![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nPrepare your connected accounts:\n\nCreate a support article with information for your connected account owners to let them know that their 1099s will be delivered by Stripe and that they should expect to receive an email from Stripe in January. [See an example](https://help.doordash.com/dashers/s/article/Common-Dasher-Tax-Questions?language=en_US).\n\nCommunicate with all eligible connected account owners to let them know they should expect to receive an email from Stripe. This helps with maximizing opt-in to e-delivery and minimizing concerns about phishing.\n\n### Sample language for communicating with your connected account users![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nSubject: Our tax partner Stripe will be sending you an important email. Body: “In the next few days, you will receive an email from Stripe with a link to download your 1099 tax form. <Platform\\_Name> partners with Stripe to facilitate payments and tax reporting, including 1099 forms. We recommend adding express@stripe.com to your address book so the email isn’t marked as spam. When you receive the email, please click into it and follow the instructions to confirm your tax details.”\n\n## How do I navigate to prior years tax forms?![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nIn the Dashboard, choose the year in the dropdown to look for past years’ forms.\n\nForms for 2019 or earlier aren’t available through your Dashboard. These forms might be filed through a different system called Payable. If you used Stripe during that period of time, please reach out to support to get the tax forms you need.\n\n## Why are my users being asked to enter the last four digits of their TIN to download their forms?![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nConnected account owners who have consented to e-delivery must pass a TIN validation to download their tax forms as an added layer of security. The key here is that they must enter the last four digits of the TIN exactly as it appears on their 1099 tax form. For Prior Years tax forms, we present a similar TIN challenge to enter the last four digits for the TIN as it appears on that particular form. If your platform didn’t use Stripe in the past to file 1099s, then those forms aren’t available in the Dashboard.\n\n## Why are connected account owners having issues validating their TIN?![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYour users might run into issues downloading their 1099 tax forms if they have updated the TIN on their connected account, if your platform has overwritten the TIN on the 1099 tax form, if they’ve simply forgotten the TIN that appears on the tax form, or if they recently received a new TIN from the IRS and it isn’t in their system yet.\n\nIn these instances, users reach out to your platform so that you can work with your users to confirm what TIN appears on the 1099 tax form or assist them with getting a corrected version of their 1099 tax form. You can also download the user’s tax form from the Tax reporting dashboard and email it to them directly. Only team members with the Tax Analyst role are able to access this information.\n\n## What else can a connected account manage using the Stripe Express Dashboard?![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe Stripe Express Dashboard also includes the Earnings page, which displays connected accounts’ [upcoming payouts and earnings](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/customize-express-dashboard#set-custom-descriptions) history through the activity feed. The activity feed shows transactions from your platform that affect connected accounts’ balances, such as payments, refunds, transfers, and payouts.\n\nIn the Account settings, connected account owners can update account details including legal entity information and personal information such as name, address, and taxpayer identification numbers, and view and update their bank account information for payouts.\n\n## Why are payouts blocked, restricted, or show as restricted soon for my account?![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYour connected account might get blocked after they update their information for a few different reasons:\n\n*   If you have applied a capability such as a 1099 capability, and they update their name or TIN to a value that doesn’t match against the IRS database then they must update their information in Stripe Express with a valid name and TIN combination.\n*   If your connected account was verified previously and changes their name and/or TIN, they are prompted to re-sign a Terms of Service agreement. Failure to do so might result in payouts being blocked until your account goes into Stripe Express and re-signs their Terms of Service agreement.\n*   If your connected account updates their details with values that can’t be verified against standard government databases, they might be asked to upload proof of identity that helps Stripe identify them. Failure to do so results in payouts being blocked. Your accounts can go into Stripe Express and submit proof of identity under the Accounts section.\n\n## Are Taxpayer Identification Numbers (TINs) checked against the IRS database?![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nTIN is verified against the IRS database if:\n\n*   You have applied the 1099-K, 1099-MISC, or any other capabilities that require a verified TIN, and\n*   The connected account meets the threshold for the applied [capability](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information-taxes#required-information).\n\nConnected accounts that enter an incorrect Name-TIN combination might see their payouts paused until they log back in to Stripe Express to [update their Name and TIN](https://support.stripe.com/express/questions/how-do-i-update-my-tax-information) with verified information.\n\n## I made a correction to a 1099, how long does this take to sync?![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYou can correct only tax forms that the IRS has accepted. To start a correction, update the data in the tax forms. You can use either the Tax form editor or CSV export to update the tax form. After you update the form, select the updated form on the **Tax reporting** page, then click **Correct** to create a correction. It can take up to 48 to 72 hours after the platform files the correction for the payee notification.\n\n## Are my connected accounts able to consolidate their view of taxes across platforms?![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nAs they get paid from different platforms, Stripe Express users can add each platform to the same Stripe Express accounts to create a single view of their earnings and their tax forms.\n\n## Is there a Stripe support address we can direct users to in our help center or is this only available in the onboarding flow of the Express App?![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nDirect users to [https://support.stripe.com/express](https://support.stripe.com/express). From here they can contact Stripe which ensures their questions are routed to a specialized support group best able to help them.\n\n## How can a connected account get their invitation email sent again?![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe connected account owner can request a new invitation link that’s sent to their email. Direct them to [this support page](https://support.stripe.com/express/how-do-i-get-a-new-invite-link) to resend their own invitation email. Ineligible users (connected accounts that didn’t meet the 2023 threshold of $600 for NEC/MISC or $20,000 and 200 transactions for K) don’t receive an email from Stripe.\n\n## If a connected account owner consents to e-delivery, do they still get a mailed copy?![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nIf the platform has paper delivery enabled, Stripe presents the connected account owner with the option to request this method of delivery. If they select this option, then Stripe mails the paper copy of their tax form to the address the platform has on file.\n\n## Edge cases for 1099 tax reporting![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe new Stripe Express dashboard doesn’t support certain types of accounts, as follows:\n\n*   Multi-user and multi-currency accounts: Accounts that have multiple users or multiple currencies associated with them aren’t able to view the Express Dashboard and hence don’t receive electronic delivery of forms.\n*   Five or more connected accounts sharing the same email: When five or more connected accounts for the same platform have the same email, they don’t receive an email from Stripe\n*   Rejected and deleted accounts: Accounts that you have rejected or deleted no longer have a Stripe relationship and hence are ineligible to login to the Stripe Express Dashboard.\n*   Split forms: If a form is split (as in not tied to the active user of a connected account), it’s not eligible for electronic delivery.\n\n## What tax details are prompted for during the pre-verification?![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nFor merchants set up as US Companies, Stripe’s 1099 product uses the business tax details except when they’re set up as a single member LLC or sole proprietorship, in which case it uses the owner’s personal tax details because those account types are disregarded entities for income tax purposes according to the IRS. For Individuals, Stripe uses personal tax details. For more information, refer to [Updating 1099 tax form details for connected accounts](https://support.stripe.com/questions/updating-1099-tax-form-details-for-connected-accounts).\n\nIf a connected account requests to use their business tax details on their 1099 tax form, and you want to support that, you can make the changes by collecting the business tax details from the user, and [updating the 1099 tax forms using CSV import](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/modify-tax-forms?method=csv#1099-csv-schema) or the [Tax Form Editor](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/modify-tax-forms?method=dashboard#understanding-the-tax-form-editor-ui) once tax form totals are finalized in January.\n\n## My connected account did not receive a pre-filing confirmation email![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nTo check whether your connected account has received an email invite, go to the [1099 Dashboard page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/taxes/forms). If the pre-filing confirmation status is **Sent**, Stripe attempted outreach to your user. If the status is **Queued** or **Not eligible**, like the example below, Stripe hasn’t sent an invite yet.\n\n![Tax form with pre-filing confirmation status](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/tax-forms-pre-filing-confirmation-status.15e4a385e3360ece2cd743f4285e93b3.png)\n\nTo send your user the pre-filling confirmation email, first confirm that their email address in Stripe is correct. Then, follow these steps:\n\n![Request pre-filing confirmation link](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/tax-forms-request-pre-filing-confirmation-link.fb53ecb1d73b4bbacf9f92b5a7c055b4.png)\n\n![Request pre-filing confirmation modal](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/tax-forms-request-pre-filing-confirmation-modal.04e45b1768e12dbd2a3db1bdd09bc85c.png)\n\nIf Stripe hasn’t sent the pre-filing confirmation email, confirm that your user’s email in Stripe matches the email where they expect to receive the tax form.\n\nTo update your user’s email address, follow the steps below. Learn more about other ways to [update emails for your accounts](#how-do-i-update-the-email-address).\n\n![Account email address](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/tax-forms-account-email.d60fd2c08eb5fedad766f98b0e5b9502.png)\n\n![Edit account email address modal](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/tax-forms-edit-account-email-modal.834f62cb61d6a4f2574e40b0e4146347.png)\n\n## My connected account was locked out of their Stripe Express account for failing the verification process. How can I resolve this issue?![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nConnected accounts must claim their Stripe accounts in order to view the Tax Center in the Express dashboard. To authorize the claim, Stripe asks the user a series of questions to verify their identity. For security reasons, if the user fails to correctly answer the verification questions too many times, Stripe locks their account. You can see the status in the 1099 dashboard. A status of “Not claimed, no attempts left” means the connected account is locked. A “Claimed” status means the connected account claimed their Stripe account.\n\n![Account status in manual review state](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/account-in-manual-review.bbed96bd10b2a7a94fdb55fcb512e362.png)\n\nYou can reset your user’s claim attempts in the 1099 Dashboard. Before removing them from manual review, we recommend reviewing and updating account claim information (such as representative name, address, SSN, EIN, and DOB) with your connected account.

  "markdown": "# Migrating accounts to Stripe | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Start processing accounts on Stripe without disrupting payments.\n\nStripe enables you to migrate your existing connected accounts along with your payment and customer data. Doing so allows you to continue to [collect payments and pay out](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/collect-then-transfer-guide) or [enable other businesses to accept payments directly](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/enable-payment-acceptance-guide). To successfully bring your existing platform business to Stripe, you need to:\n\n1.  Create a migration plan and timeline\n2.  Update your integration for connected accounts\n3.  Create and onboard accounts\n4.  Handle outstanding and ongoing requirements\n5.  Migrate payment and customer data to Stripe\n\n## Create a migration plan![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nA successful migration to Stripe includes a migration plan, a timeline, and KYC information for connected accounts, as well as payment and customer data.\n\nConnected accounts must onboard to Stripe, which requires sending Stripe Know Your Customer (KYC) data for each account. Stripe’s requirements can require collecting additional information from your accounts. Perform an analysis to understand what data has been collected with your previous provider and what data Stripe requires. Stripe verifies KYC data before activating connected accounts. Monitor account verification status using the [account.updated](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-account.updated) event or the [Retrieve Account](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account/retrieve) API. Accounts that fail to verify require action before they’re activated.\n\nInclude a hard cutover date for payment data after onboarding accounts to Stripe. Payment and customer data requires [a PAN import](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/data-migrations/pan-import) as part of the cutover. We recommend that you import accounts in batches.\n\n## Update your integration![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYour application can require changes as part of the integration updates to migrate to Stripe. For example, consider any changes to your connected accounts’ usage of your platform, such as pricing updates. Stripe recommends communicating any changes to your accounts ahead of time.\n\n### Stripe terms of service agreement![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYour connected accounts must accept the Stripe terms of service before they’re activated.\n\nFor accounts where Stripe is responsible for collecting updated information when requirements are due or change (including Standard and Express accounts), the account accepts Stripe’s terms of service as part of the onboarding flow.\n\nIf your platform is responsible for [collecting updated information](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-controller-requirement_collection) from a connected account (including Custom accounts) when requirements change, you can [wrap Stripe’s terms of service in your own terms of service](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/updating-service-agreements#adding-stripes-service-agreement-to-your-terms-of-service). We recommend placing terms of service acceptance at the end of the onboarding flow, but you can also have it at the start if that makes more sense for your business. When creating or updating connected accounts, record acceptance of the [updated Terms of Service information](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/update#update_account-tos_acceptance) to send to Stripe, and communicate that to the accounts.\n\n### Onboard connected accounts to Stripe![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nStripe offers different levels of onboarding support for your connected accounts. Build an onboarding flow for your connected accounts using any of the following methods:\n\n| Method | Pros | Cons |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| [API-based onboarding](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom/onboarding#api-based-onboarding) | Exercise full control over your own UI | *   Expensive and time-consuming to build<br>*   Continuing high maintenance, especially to keep in compliance with changing global requirements<br>*   Can’t resolve Stripe risk reviews |\n| [Embedded onboarding](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom/onboarding#embedded-onboarding) new | *   [Highly themeable](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/customize-connect-embedded-components)<br>*   Limited or no Stripe branding<br>*   Connected accounts remain in the flow of your site<br>*   Low effort integration | Limited control over the flow logic |\n| [Stripe-hosted onboarding](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom/onboarding#stripe-hosted-onboarding) | Lowest effort integration | *   Stripe-branded with limited platform branding<br>*   Limited control over the flow logic<br>*   Connected accounts redirect to Stripe instead of completing the process without leaving your site |\n\n## Create and onboard accounts![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe following is an overview of the process:\n\n### Establish account requirements ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nThe following factors affect the [onboarding requirements](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information) for your connected accounts:\n\n*   The origin country of the connected accounts\n*   The [service agreement type](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/service-agreement-types) applicable to the connected accounts\n*   The [capabilities](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-capabilities) requested for the connected accounts\n*   The [business type](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-business_type) (for example, individual or company) and [company.structure](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-company-structure) (for example, public corporation or private partnership)\n\nUse the interactive form to see how changing these factors affects the requirements.\n\n### Requirements form![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n### Create the connected account![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nFor each account to be migrated to Stripe, create an associated Account.\n\nUse the [Create Account](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/create) API to create a connected account with `controller` set to the desired account preferences. You can prefill any information, but at a minimum, you must specify the `controller`. The country of the account defaults to the same country as your platform, and the account confirms the selection during onboarding.\n\n#### Note\n\nThis example includes only some of the fields you can set when creating an account. For a full list of the fields you can set, such as `address` and `website_url`, see the [Create Account API reference](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/create).\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/accounts \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d \"controller[fees][payer]\"=account \\  -d \"controller[losses][payments]\"=stripe \\  -d \"controller[stripe_dashboard][type]\"=none \\  -d \"controller[requirement_collection]\"=stripe \\  -d country=US \\  -d \"capabilities[card_payments][requested]\"=true \\  -d \"capabilities[transfers][requested]\"=true`\n\nIf you’ve already collected information for your connected accounts, you can prefill that information on the account object. You can prefill any account information, including personal and business information, external account information, and so on.\n\nConnect Onboarding doesn’t ask for the prefilled information. However, it does ask the account holder to confirm the prefilled information before accepting the [Connect service agreement](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/service-agreement-types).\n\nWhen testing your integration, prefill account information using [test data](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/testing).\n\nSuccessful creation returns the [account object](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object). Inspect the object for the connected account `id` and store the value in your database.\n\n`{   ...   \"id\":` \n\n`\"{{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}\"`\n\n`,   ... }`\n\nAfter updating Stripe with all existing data, look for any outstanding requirements. Any outstanding requirements are listed in the `currently_due` array. All `currently_due` requirements need to be collected from the account for Stripe to verify the account and activate the account’s capabilities.\n\n`{   ...   \"requirements\": {     \"alternatives\": [],     \"current_deadline\": null,     \"currently_due\": [       \"business_profile.url\",       \"external_account\",       \"individual.first_name\",       \"individual.last_name\",       \"tos_acceptance.date\",       \"tos_acceptance.ip\"     ],     \"disabled_reason\": \"requirements.past_due\",     \"errors\": [],`\n\nAfter providing all existing data on an account, direct the account to a Stripe UI to set up Stripe credentials, confirm the information, and accept the Stripe terms of service.\n\n### Take new accounts through an onboarding flow![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nIn addition to migrating existing accounts, build a flow for new accounts to onboard to Stripe. You can also use this onboarding flow to collect missing data for accounts being migrated.\n\nReview [onboarding options](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/onboarding) to create your onboarding flow.\n\n## Handle outstanding and ongoing requirements![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nWhen the connected account’s data is submitted, Stripe verifies it. This process might take minutes or hours depending on the nature of the verification required. During this process, the capabilities you requested have [a pending status](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-capabilities).\n\n### Review status![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYou can retrieve the status of your connected account’s capabilities by:\n\n*   Inspecting the Account object’s [capabilities](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-capabilities) hash for the relevant capability.\n*   Requesting capabilities directly from the [Capabilities API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/capabilities/retrieve) and inspecting the status of the relevant capability.\n*   Listening for `account.updated` [events](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-account.updated) in your [webhook](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/webhooks) endpoint and inspecting the `capabilities` hash for the relevant capability.\n\nAfter verifications are complete, the capability becomes `active` and available to the connected account. Account verifications run continuously, and if a future verification fails, a capability can transition out of `active`. Listen for `account.updated` events to detect changes to capability states.\n\nConfirm that your Connect integration is compliant and operational by checking that the account’s `charges_enabled` and `payouts_enabled` are both true. You can use the API or listen for `account.updated` events. For details on other relevant fields, check the account’s [requirements](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-requirements) hash. You can’t confirm the integration based on a single value because statuses can vary depending on the application and related policies.\n\n*   [charges\\_enabled](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-charges_enabled) confirms that your full charge path including the charge and transfer works correctly and evaluates if either `card_payments` or `transfers` capabilities are active.\n*   [payouts\\_enabled](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-payouts_enabled) evaluates whether your connected account can pay out to an external account. Depending on your risk policies, you can allow your connected account to start transacting without payouts enabled. You [must eventually enable payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/manage-payout-schedule) to pay your connected accounts.\n\nYou can use the following logic as a starting point for defining a summary status to display to your connected account.\n\n`# Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production. # See your keys here: [https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys) Stripe.api_key =` \n\n`'sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc'`\n\n`def account_state(account)   reqs = account.requirements    if reqs.disabled_reason && reqs.disabled_reason.include?(\"rejected\")     \"rejected\"   elsif account.payouts_enabled && account.charges_enabled     if reqs.pending_verification       \"pending enablement\"     elsif !reqs.disabled_reason && !reqs.currently_due       if !reqs.eventually_due         \"complete\"       else         \"enabled\"       end     else       \"restricted\"     end   elsif !account.payouts_enabled && account.charges_enabled     \"restricted (payouts disabled)\"   elsif !account.charges_enabled && account.payouts_enabled     \"restricted (charges disabled)\"   elsif reqs.past_due     \"restricted (past due)\"   elsif reqs.pending_verification     \"pending (disabled)\"   else     \"restricted\"   end end  accounts = Stripe::Account.list(limit: 10)  accounts.each do |account|     puts \"#{account.id} has state: #{account_state(account)}\" end`\n\n### Handle verification errors![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nHandle verification failures differently depending on your onboarding flow.\n\n#### Note\n\nYou can’t use the API to respond to Stripe risk reviews. You can enable your connected accounts to respond using embedded components, Stripe-hosted onboarding, or remediation links. You can also use the Dashboard to respond to risk reviews on behalf of your connected accounts.\n\nListen to the [account.updated](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-account.updated) event. If the account contains any `currently_due` fields when the `current_deadline` arrives, the corresponding functionality is disabled and those fields are added to `past_due`.\n\n[Create a form](#create-forms-to-collect-information) with clear instructions that the account can use to correct the information. Notify the account, then [submit the corrected information](#update-the-connected-account) using the Accounts API.\n\nIf you plan to create custom flows to handle all your verification errors:\n\n*   Review the details regarding all possible [verification errors and how to handle them](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/handling-api-verification).\n*   [Test verification states](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/testing-verification).\n\n## Migrate payment and customer data to Stripe![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nAfter your connected accounts are created on Stripe, [request a PAN data import](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/data-migrations/pan-import), which migrates your payment and customer data for use on Stripe.\n\n## See also![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n*   [Choose your onboarding configuration](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/onboarding)\n*   [Handling identity verification with the API](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/handling-api-verification)\n*   [Testing account identity verification](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/testing-verification)",

  "markdown": "# Connect webhooks | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Learn how to use webhooks with Connect to be notified of Stripe activity.\n\nStripe uses [webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks \"webhook\") to notify your application when an event happens in your account. All [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect \"Connect\") integrations should establish a [webhook endpoint](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/webhooks) to listen for Connect events.\n\n## Connect webhooks![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThere are a few types of webhooks:\n\n*   _Account_ webhooks are for activity on your own account (for example, most requests made using your API keys and without [authenticating as another Stripe account](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/authentication)). This includes all types of charges, except those made directly on a connected account.\n*   _Connect_ webhooks are for activity on any connected account. All events on the connected account are sent to the Connect webhooks. This includes the important `account.updated` event for any connected account and direct charges.\n\nWhen creating your webhook, ensure it is correctly configured to receive Connect webhook events. You can do this with the API by setting the [connect parameter](https://docs.stripe.com/api/webhook_endpoints/create#create_webhook_endpoint-connect) to `true` when creating the webhook endpoint, or [through the Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/webhooks).\n\n![Webhook settings in the Stripe Dashboard](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/webhooks.ac3d6c19a5281fbbd2b85a335cd887b3.png)\n\nFor Connect webhooks, only test webhooks are sent to your development webhook URLs, but _both live and test_ webhooks are sent to your production webhook URLs. This is because you can perform both live and test transactions under a production application. For this reason, we recommend that you check the `livemode` value when receiving an event webhook to know what action, if any, users should take.\n\nAs we state in the [event object reference](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/object), each event for a connected account also contains a top-level `account` property. It identifies the account that the webhook is sent to and the `data[object]` it belongs to. Because these objects belong to other accounts, you must make the API requests [as the corresponding connected account](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/authentication) to access them.\n\n`{   \"id\":` \n\n`\"{{EVENT_ID}}\"`\n\n`,   \"livemode\": true,   \"object\": \"event\",   \"type\": \"customer.created\",   \"account\":   \"{{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}\"  ,   \"pending_webhooks\": 2,   \"created\": 1349654313,   \"data\": {...} }`\n\nThere are several events related to accounts that Stripe recommends listening for:\n\n| Event | data.object type | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `account.application.deauthorized` | `application` | Occurs when a connected account disconnects from your platform. You can use it to trigger cleanup on your server. Available for connected accounts with access to the Stripe Dashboard, which includes [Standard accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/standard-accounts). |\n| `account.external_account.updated` | An external account, such as `card` or `bank_account` | Occurs when [a bank account or debit card attached to a connected account is updated](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/payouts-bank-accounts), which can impact payouts. Available for connected accounts that your platform controls, which includes Custom and Express accounts, and Standard accounts with [platform controls](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/platform-controls-for-stripe-dashboard-accounts) enabled. |\n| `account.updated` | `account` | Allows you to monitor changes to connected account requirements and status changes. Available for all connected accounts. |\n| `balance.available` | `balance` | Occurs when your Stripe balance has been updated (for example, when [funds you’ve added from your bank account](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/add-and-pay-out-guide#add-funds) are available for transfer to your connected account). |\n| `payment_intent.succeeded` | `payment_intent` | Occurs when a payment intent results in a successful charge. Available for all payments, including [destination](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/collect-then-transfer-guide#fulfillment) and [direct](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/enable-payment-acceptance-guide) charges. |\n| `payout.failed` | `payout` | Occurs when [a payout fails](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/payouts-connected-accounts#webhooks). When a payout fails, the external account involved will be disabled, and no automatic or manual payouts can go through until the external account is updated. |\n| `person.updated` | `person` | If you [use the Persons API](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/handling-api-verification#verification-process), allows you to monitor changes to requirements and status changes for individuals. Available for connected accounts that your platform controls, which includes Custom and Express accounts, and Standard accounts with [platform controls](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/platform-controls-for-stripe-dashboard-accounts) enabled. |\n\n`# Using Sinatra. require 'sinatra' require 'stripe'  set :port, 4242  # Set your secret key.

They can select different time intervals to view.\n\n## Accessing the Express Dashboard![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThere are two ways to access the Express Dashboard, login links and self-service. We recommend using login links.\n\n### Platform login links ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nYou can generate single-use account-specific login links that redirect connected accounts from your platform application to the Express Dashboard login page. They then log into the Dashboard using SMS authentication.\n\nTo learn about using login links, see [Integrate the Express Dashboard in your platform](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/integrate-express-dashboard).\n\n### Self-serve access ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nConnected accounts can access the Express Dashboard by logging into [Stripe Express](https://connect.stripe.com/express_login) using their account email and SMS authentication.\n\n#### Note\n\nOnly live mode accounts can log into Stripe Express. For testing, use [login links](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/integrate-express-dashboard).\n\nTo learn more about self-serve access, see the [Stripe Express support article](https://support.stripe.com/express/questions/how-do-i-login-to-my-stripe-express-account).\n\n## Supported browsers![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe Express Dashboard supports the same browsers that the [Full Stripe Dashboard supports](https://docs.stripe.com/dashboard/basics#browser-compatibility). However, it doesn’t support WebView browsers embedded in apps. Only standalone browsers can open it.",

  "markdown": "# Get started with Connect embedded components\n\n## Learn how to embed dashboard functionality into your website.\n\nUse Connect embedded components to add connected account dashboard functionality to your website. These libraries and their supporting API allow you to grant your users access to Stripe products directly in your dashboard.\n\nFor an immersive version of this guide, see the [Connect embedded components integration quickstart](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/connect-embedded-components/quickstart). You can also download a sample integration from there. To customize the appearance of Connect embedded components, use the `appearance` options when you initialize `StripeConnectInstance`. See the [full list of appearance parameters](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/customize-connect-embedded-components).\n\n[](#account-sessions)\n\nStripe uses an [AccountSession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_sessions) to express your intent to delegate API access to your connected account.\n\nThe AccountSessions API returns a [client secret](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_sessions/object#account_session_object-client_secret \"AccountSession client secret\") that allows an embedded component in the web client to access a connected account’s resources as if you were making the API calls for them.\n\n### Create an AccountSession Server![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nIn a single page application, your client initiates a request to obtain the account session to your server. You can create a new endpoint on your server that returns the client secret to the browser:\n\n`require 'sinatra' require 'stripe' # This is a placeholder - it should be replaced with your secret API key. # Sign in to see your own test API key embedded in code samples. # Don’t submit any personally identifiable information in requests made with this key. Stripe.api_key =` \n\n`'sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc'`\n\n`post '/account_session' do   content_type 'application/json'    # Create an AccountSession   begin     account_session = Stripe::AccountSession.create({       account: '{{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}',       components: {         payments: {           enabled: true,           features: {             refund_management: true,             dispute_management: true,             capture_payments: true           }         }       }     })      {       client_secret: account_session[:client_secret]     }.to_json   rescue => error     puts \"An error occurred when calling the Stripe API to create an account session: #{error.message}\";     return [500, { error: error.message }.to_json]   end end`\n\n### Create Account Session API![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe [Create Account Session API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_sessions/create) determines component and feature access for Connect embedded components. Stripe enforces these parameters for any components that correspond to the account session. If your site supports multiple user roles, make sure components and features that are enabled for that account session correspond to the current user’s role. For example, you can enable [refund management](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_sessions/create#create_account_session-components-payments-features-refund_management) only for administrators of your site, but not for other users. To ensure user role access are enforced, your backend must host the logic that maps your site’s user role to account session components.\n\n### Set up Connect.js Client![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nInstall the [npm package](https://github.com/stripe/connect-js) to use Connect.js as a module.\n\n`npm install --save @stripe/connect-js`\n\n### Load and initialize Connect.js Client![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nCall `loadConnectAndInitialize` with your publishable key and a function that retrieves a client secret by calling the new endpoint you created on your server. Use the returned `StripeConnectInstance` to create embedded components. After initializing Connect.js, you can mount components to or unmount components from the DOM at any time. That includes any elements rendered inside React or Vue portals.\n\nTo create a component, call `create` on the `StripeConnectInstance` that you created above, then pass in the component name. This returns a [custom element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_custom_elements) that Connect.js registers and uses to automatically wire your DOM up to Stripe. You can then `append` this element to your DOM.\n\nCall `create` with `payments`, then add the result to your DOM to render a payments UI.\n\n`<head>   <script type=\"module\" src=\"index.js\" defer></script> </head> <body>   <h1>Payments</h1>   <div id=\"container\"></div>   <div id=\"error\" hidden>Something went wrong!</div> </body>`\n\n`import {loadConnectAndInitialize} from '@stripe/connect-js';  const fetchClientSecret = async () => {   // Fetch the AccountSession client secret   const response = await fetch('/account_session', { method: \"POST\" });   if (!response.ok) {     // Handle errors on the client side here     const {error} = await response.json();     console.error('An error occurred: ', error);     document.querySelector('#error').removeAttribute('hidden');     return undefined;   } else {     const {client_secret: clientSecret} = await response.json();     document.querySelector('#error').setAttribute('hidden', '');     return clientSecret;   } }  const stripeConnectInstance = loadConnectAndInitialize({     // This is a placeholder - it should be replaced with your publishable API key.     // Sign in to see your own test API key embedded in code samples.     // Don’t submit any personally identifiable information in requests made with this key.     publishableKey:` \n\n`\"pk_test_TYooMQauvdEDq54NiTphI7jx\"`\n\n`,     fetchClientSecret: fetchClientSecret,   }); const paymentComponent = stripeConnectInstance.create(\"payments\"); const container = document.getElementById(\"container\"); container.appendChild(paymentComponent);`\n\n[See a complete list of supported embedded components →](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/supported-embedded-components)\n\n[](#configuring-connect-js)\n\nThe `loadConnectAndInitialize` method on the client takes several different options to configure Connect.js.\n\n| Option | Description |     |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `publishableKey` | The [publishable key](https://docs.stripe.com/keys) for your integration. | required |\n| `fetchClientSecret` | The function that retrieves the [client secret](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_sessions/object#account_session_object-client_secret \"AccountSession client secret\") returned by `/v1/account_sessions`. This tells `StripeConnectInstance` which account to delegate access to. This function is also used to retrieve a client secret function to refresh the session when it expires. | required |\n| `appearance` | An object to customize the look of Connect embedded components. | optional |\n| `locale` | A parameter to specify the [locale](#supported-languages) that Connect embedded components use. The locale defaults to the browser language. If the language passed in isn’t directly supported, a reasonable alternative is used (for example `fr-be` might fall back to `fr-fr`). | optional |\n| `fonts` | An array of custom fonts available for use by any embedded components created from a `StripeConnectInstance`. Fonts can be specified as [CssFontSource](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-connect-embedded-components#css-font-source) or [CustomFontSource](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-connect-embedded-components#custom-font-source) objects. | optional |\n\n## Customize the look of Connect embedded components![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nWe offer a set of options to customize the look and feel of Connect embedded components. These customizations affect buttons, icons, and other accents in our design system.\n\nYou can set these options when initializing `StripeConnectInstance` by passing values to the `appearance` object. You can only use the [Connect.js options](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-connect-embedded-components#configuring-connect-js) to modify styles in Connect embedded components. The font family and background color of Connect embedded components can be overridden with CSS selectors, but Stripe doesn’t support overriding any other styles.\n\n`const fetchClientSecret = async () => {   const response = await fetch('/account_session');   const {client_secret: clientSecret} = await response.json();   return clientSecret; }  const stripeConnectInstance = loadConnectAndInitialize({   publishableKey:` \n\n`\"pk_test_TYooMQauvdEDq54NiTphI7jx\"`\n\n``,   fetchClientSecret: fetchClientSecret,   fonts: [     {       cssSrc: \"[https://myfonts.example.com/mycssfile.css](https://myfonts.example.com/mycssfile.css)\",     },     {       src: `url([https://my-domain.com/assets/my-font-2.woff)`,](https://my-domain.com/assets/my-font-2.woff)%60,)       family: 'My Font'     }   ],   appearance: {     // See all possible variables below     overlays: \"dialog\",     variables: {       fontFamily: 'My Font',       colorPrimary: \"#FF0000\",     },   }, });``\n\n### The `fonts` object ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nThe `fonts` object in `stripeConnect.initialize` takes an array of [CssFontSource](https://docs.stripe.com/js/appendix/css_font_source_object) or [CustomFontSource](https://docs.stripe.com/js/appendix/custom_font_source_object) objects.\n\nIf you’re using custom fonts in your page (that is, `.woff` or `.tff` files), you must specify these files when initializing Connect embedded components. Doing this allows Connect embedded components to properly render these fonts. You can specify these as:\n\n#### CssFontSource ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nUse this object to pass a stylesheet URL that defines your custom fonts when creating a `StripeConnectInstance`. With a CssFontSource object, your [CSP configuration](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-connect-embedded-components#csp-and-http-header-requirements) must allow fetching the domains associated with the CSS file URLs specified as CssFontSource.\n\n#### CustomFontSource ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nUse this object to pass custom fonts when creating a `StripeConnectInstance`.\n\n| Name | Type | Example value |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `family` | string `required` | `Avenir` |\n| The name to give the font. |     |     |\n| `src` | string `required` | `url(https://my-domain.com/assets/avenir.woff)` |\n| A valid [src](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@font-face/src) value pointing to your custom font file. This is usually (though not always) a link to a file with a `.woff` , `.otf`, or `.svg` suffix. |     |     |\n| `display` | string `optional` | `auto` |\n| A valid [font-display](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@font-face/font-display) value. |     |     |\n| `style` | string `optional` | `normal` |\n| One of `normal`, `italic`, or `oblique`. |     |     |\n| `unicodeRange` | string `optional` | `U+0-7F` |\n| A valid [unicode-range](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@font-face/unicode-range) value. |     |     |\n| `weight` | string `optional` | `400` |\n| A valid [font-weight](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-weight). Note that this is a string, not a number. |     |     |\n\n### The `appearance` object![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe `appearance` object in `loadConnectAndInitialize` takes the following optional properties:\n\n| Name | Type | Example value |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `overlays` | ‘dialog’ (default) \\| ‘drawer’ | `dialog` |\n| The type of overlay used throughout the Connect.js design system. Set this to be either a Dialog or Drawer. |     |     |\n| `variables` | object | `{colorPrimary: \"#0074D4\"}` |\n| See the [full list of appearance variables](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/embedded-appearance-options). |     |     |\n\n### Updating Connect embedded components after initialization![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe `update` method supports updating Connect embedded components after initialization. This is useful for switching appearance options at runtime (without refreshing the page). To do so, use the same `stripeConnectInstance` object you created with `initialize` and call the `update` method on it:\n\n`stripeConnectInstance.update({   appearance: {     variables: {       colorPrimary: \"#FF0000\",     },   },   locale: 'en-US', });`\n\n#### Note\n\nNot all options (e.g. `fonts`) are updatable. The supported options for this method are a subset of the options offered in `initialize`. This supports updating the `appearance` and `locale`.\n\n### Width and height![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nConnect embedded components behave like regular `block` HTML elements. By default, they take 100% of the `width` of their parent HTML element, and grow in height according to the content rendered inside. You can control the `width` of Connect embedded components by specifying the `width` of the HTML parent. You can’t directly control the `height` as that depends on the rendered content, however, you can limit the height with `maxHeight` and `overflow: scroll`, just like with other HTML `block` elements.\n\n## Authentication![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nWe offer a set of APIs to manage account sessions and user credentials in Connect embedded components.\n\n### Refresh the client secret![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nOn long running sessions, the session from the initially provided [client secret](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_sessions/object#account_session_object-client_secret \"AccountSession client secret\") might expire. When it expires, we automatically use `fetchClientSecret` to retrieve a new client secret and refresh the session. You don’t need to pass in any additional parameters.\n\n`import { loadConnectAndInitialize } from \"@stripe/connect-js\"; // Example method to retrieve the client secret from your server const fetchClientSecret = async () => {   const response = await fetch('/account_session');   const {client_secret: clientSecret} = await response.json();   return clientSecret; }  const stripeConnectInstance = loadConnectAndInitialize({   publishableKey: \"{{PUBLISHABLE_KEY}}\",   fetchClientSecret: fetchClientSecret, });`\n\n### Log out![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nWe recommend that you call `logout` on the `stripeConnectInstance` to destroy the associated account session object after a user logs out of your app. This disables all Connect embedded components that link to that `stripeConnectInstance`.\n\n`// Call this when your user logs out stripeConnectInstance.logout();`\n\n## CSP and HTTP header requirements![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nIf your website implements a [Content Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP \"Content Security Policy\"), you need to update the policy by adding the following rules:\n\n*   `frame-src` `https://connect-js.stripe.com` `https://js.stripe.com`\n*   `img-src` `https://*.stripe.com`\n*   `script-src` `https://connect-js.stripe.com` `https://js.stripe.com`\n*   `style-src` `sha256-0hAheEzaMe6uXIKV4EehS9pu1am1lj/KnnzrOYqckXk=` (SHA of empty style element)\n\nIf you’re using a CSS file to load [web fonts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-connect-embedded-components#fonts-object) for use with Connect embedded components, its URL must be allowed by your [connect-src](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/connect-src) CSP directive.\n\nSetting certain [HTTP response headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Response_header) enables the full functionality of Connect embedded components:\n\n*   [`Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy), `unsafe-none`. This (`unsafe-none`) is the default value of the header, so not setting this header works. Other values like `same-origin` break [user authentication](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-connect-embedded-components#user-authentication-in-connect-embedded-components) in Connect embedded components.\n\n## Supported browsers![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nWe support the same set of browsers that the [Stripe Dashboard currently supports](https://docs.stripe.com/dashboard/basics#browser-compatibility):\n\n*   The last 20 major versions of Chrome and Firefox\n*   The last two major versions of Safari and Edge\n*   The last two major versions of mobile Safari on iOS\n\nConnect embedded components aren’t supported in webviews, they are only supported in standalone browsers.\n\n## Supported languages![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nWe localized Connect embedded components for the following languages:\n\n| Language | Locale code |\n| --- | --- |\n| Bulgarian (Bulgaria) | `bg-BG` |\n| Chinese (Simplified) | `zh-Hans` |\n| Chinese (Traditional - Hong Kong) | `zh-Hant-HK` |\n| Chinese (Traditional - Taiwan) | `zh-Hant-TW` |\n| Croatian (Croatia) | `hr-HR` |\n| Czech (Czechia) | `cs-CZ` |\n| Danish (Denmark) | `da-DK` |\n| Dutch (Netherlands) | `nl-NL` |\n| English (Australia) | `en-AU` |\n| English (India) | `en-IN` |\n| English (Ireland) | `en-IE` |\n| English (New Zealand) | `en-NZ` |\n| English (Singapore) | `en-SG` |\n| English (United Kingdom) | `en-GB` |\n| English (United States) | `en-US` |\n| Estonian (Estonia) | `et-EE` |\n| Filipino (Philippines) | `fil-PH` |\n| Finnish (Finland) | `fi-FI` |\n| French (Canada) | `fr-CA` |\n| French (France) | `fr-FR` |\n| German (Germany) | `de-DE` |\n| Greek (Greece) | `el-GR` |\n| Hungarian (Hungary) | `hu-HU` |\n| Indonesian (Indonesia) | `id-ID` |\n| Italian (Italy) | `it-IT` |\n| Japanese (Japan) | `ja-JP` |\n| Korean (South Korea) | `ko-KR` |\n| Latvian (Latvia) | `lv-LV` |\n| Lithuanian (Lithuania) | `lt-LT` |\n| Malay (Malaysia) | `ms-MY` |\n| Maltese (Malta) | `mt-MT` |\n| Norwegian Bokmål (Norway) | `nb-NO` |\n| Polish (Poland) | `pl-PL` |\n| Portuguese (Brazil) | `pt-BR` |\n| Portuguese (Portugal) | `pt-PT` |\n| Romanian (Romania) | `ro-RO` |\n| Slovak (Slovakia) | `sk-SK` |\n| Slovenian (Slovenia) | `sl-SI` |\n| Spanish (Argentina) | `es-AR` |\n| Spanish (Brazil) | `es-BR` |\n| Spanish (Latin America) | `es-419` |\n| Spanish (Mexico) | `es-MX` |\n| Spanish (Spain) | `es-ES` |\n| Swedish (Sweden) | `sv-SE` |\n| Thai (Thailand) | `th-TH` |\n| Turkish (Türkiye) | `tr-TR` |\n| Vietnamese (Vietnam) | `vi-VN` |\n\n[](#integrate-without-sdk)\n\nWe recommend integrating with our [javascript](https://github.com/stripe/connect-js) and [React component wrappers](https://github.com/stripe/react-connect-js), which simplify the loading of Connect embedded components and provide TypeScript definitions for our supported interfaces. If your build system currently doesn’t support taking a dependency on packages, you can integrate without these packages.\n\nManually add the Connect.js script tag to the `<head>` of each page on your site.\n\n### Using Connect.js without NPM ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nAfter Connect.js completes loading, it initializes the global window variable `StripeConnect` and calls `StripeConnect.onLoad` if you define it. You can safely initialize Connect.js by setting up an `onload` function and calling `StripeConnect.init` with the same [Connect.js options](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-connect-embedded-components#configuring-connect-js) as `loadConnectAndInitialize`.\n\n`window.StripeConnect = window.StripeConnect || {}; StripeConnect.onLoad = () => {   const stripeConnectInstance = StripeConnect.init({       // This is a placeholder - it should be replaced with your publishable API key.       // Sign in to see your own test API key embedded in code samples.       // Don’t submit any personally identifiable information in requests made with this key.       publishableKey:` \n\n`\"pk_test_TYooMQauvdEDq54NiTphI7jx\"`\n\n`,       fetchClientSecret: fetchClientSecret,     });    const payments = stripeConnectInstance.create('payments');   document.body.appendChild(payments); };`\n\n## User authentication in Connect embedded components![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nConnect embedded components typically don’t require user authentication. In some scenarios, Connect embedded components require the connected account to sign in with their Stripe account to provide the necessary functionality (for example, writing information to the account legal entity in the case of the [account onboarding](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/supported-embedded-components/account-onboarding) component).\n\nAuthentication includes a popup to a Stripe-owned window. The connected account must authenticate before they can continue their workflow.\n\nThe [account onboarding](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/supported-embedded-components/account-onboarding) and [account management](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/supported-embedded-components/account-onboarding) components require connected accounts to authenticate. Other components might require authentication within the component after they initially render. Authentication for these components and scenarios is required for all connected accounts unless the platform has disabled external account collection.",

The information on this page applies only to less flexible connected account types, which are mainly used by existing platforms.\n\n#### Note\n\nConnect supports the following account types:\n\n*   [Standard](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/standard-accounts)\n*   [Express](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/express-accounts)\n*   [Custom](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom-accounts)\n\n## Choose an account type ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nYou must consider several factors when choosing an account type. Integration effort and connected account user experience are especially important because they can affect engineering resource expenditure and conversion rates. After you create a connected account, you can’t change its type.\n\nStripe recommends that you use Express or Standard connected accounts, which require less integration effort. If you want more control over your connected accounts, consider using Express or Custom connected accounts. To learn which account type we recommend for your business, refer to your [platform profile](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/settings/profile).\n\nThere’s an additional cost for using Express or Custom connected accounts.\n\n|     | Standard | Express | Custom |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Integration effort** | Lowest | Low | Significantly higher |\n| **Integration method** | API or OAuth | API | API |\n| **Fraud and dispute liability** | Connected account | Platform | Platform |\n| **Platform can specify payout timing?** | Yes, with [Platform controls](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/platform-controls-for-stripe-dashboard-accounts) | Yes | Yes |\n| **Onboarding** | Stripe | Stripe | Platform or Stripe |\n| **Identity information gathering** | Stripe | Stripe | Platform or Stripe |\n| **Connected account can access the Dashboard?** | Yes, full Dashboard | Yes, Express Dashboard | No  |\n| **Connected account support provided by** | Platform and Stripe | Platform and Stripe | Platform |\n| **Automatic updates for new compliance requirements** | Yes | Yes | No  |\n| **Support new countries without integration changes** | Yes | Yes | No  |\n| **Ideal for platforms** | With experienced online businesses as connected accounts | Any type | With significant engineering resources to dedicate to a fully white-labeled experience |\n\nWith Standard connected accounts, the connected account is responsible for fraud and disputes when using [direct charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/charges#types), but that can vary when using [destination charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/charges#types).\n\n## Express connected accounts ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nWith _Express_ connected accounts, Stripe handles the onboarding and identity verification processes. The platform has the ability to specify [charge types](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/charges) and set the connected account’s [payout settings](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/payouts-connected-accounts) programmatically. The platform is responsible for handling disputes and refunds, which is similar to a Custom connected account.\n\nAlthough your connected account has interactions with Stripe, they primarily interact with your platform, particularly for the core payment processing functionality. For Express connected account holders, Stripe provides an Express Dashboard (a lighter version of the Dashboard) that allows them to manage their personal information and see [payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts \"payout\") to their bank.\n\nUse Express connected accounts when you:\n\n*   Want to get started quickly (letting Stripe handle account onboarding, management, and identity verification)\n*   Want to use [destination charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges) or [separate charges and transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n*   Want significant control over interactions with your connected accounts\n\nExamples of platforms that use Express connected accounts include, but are not limited to: a [home-rental marketplace](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/collect-then-transfer-guide) like Airbnb, or a ride-hailing service like Lyft.\n\nGlobal compliance requirements do evolve and change over time. With Express, Stripe proactively collects information when requirements change. For best practices on how to communicate to your connected accounts when that happens, visit the [guide for Express accounts](https://support.stripe.com/questions/best-practices-for-connect-platforms-communicating-updates-to-verification-requirements-with-standard-or-express-connected-accounts).\n\n### Express connected account availability![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nSelect one of the available countries when you create an Express connected account.

With Standard connected accounts, Stripe proactively collects information when requirements change. For best practices on how to communicate to your connected accounts when that happens, visit the [guide for Standard accounts](https://support.stripe.com/questions/best-practices-for-connect-platforms-communicating-updates-to-verification-requirements-with-standard-or-express-connected-accounts).\n\n#### Country can't be changed\n\nAfter you create a Standard connected account, you can’t change its country.\n\n## Custom connected accounts ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nA _Custom_ connected account is almost completely invisible to the account holder. You—the platform—are responsible for all interactions with your connected accounts, including collecting any information Stripe needs. You have the ability to change all of the account’s [settings](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/updating-service-agreements), including the payout [bank or debit card account](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/payouts-connected-accounts), programmatically.\n\nCustom connected account holders don’t have access to the Dashboard, and Stripe doesn’t contact them directly.\n\nUse Custom connected accounts when you:\n\n*   Want complete control over interactions with your connected accounts\n*   Can build the significant infrastructure required to collect connected account information, deploy a custom dashboard, and handle support\n*   Want to handle all communication with your connected accounts, involving no direct contact between them and Stripe\n\nCreating and managing Custom connected accounts requires a larger integration effort than the other account types. To learn more, see [Using Connect with Custom accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom-accounts).\n\nGlobal compliance requirements do evolve and change over time. For best practices on how to communicate to your connected accounts when requirements change, see the [guide for Custom accounts](https://support.stripe.com/questions/best-practices-for-connect-platforms-communicating-updates-to-verification-requirements-with-custom-connected-accounts).\n\nIf you decide to use Custom connected accounts, Stripe recommends that you use [Connect Onboarding for Custom accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom/hosted-onboarding) to collect onboarding and verification information from your connected accounts. That decreases your integration effort and eliminates the need to update your onboarding form when requirements change.\n\n### Custom connected account availability![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nSelect one of the available countries when you create a Custom connected account.

  "markdown": "# Collect payments then pay out\n\nThis guide demonstrates how to accept payments from customers and move funds to the bank accounts of your sellers or service providers, without writing code. Use this guide if you:\n\n*   Want to accept payments from customers and pay out sellers or service providers without writing code.\n*   Want to rapidly test product-market fit without coding.\n*   Are a marketplace that is selling directly to end customers (as opposed to a SaaS platform who is selling software to help others operate their own business).\n\nIn this example, we’ll build a marketplace that allows T-shirt artists to sell customized T-shirts. You can use the concepts covered in this guide in other business applications as well.\n\n## Prerequisites![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n1.  [Register your platform](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/tasklist).\n2.  Add business details to [activate your account](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/onboarding).\n3.  Complete your [platform profile](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/settings/profile).\n4.  Customize your Connect brand settings on the [Stripe Dashboard settings page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect/stripe-dashboard/branding) and customize your Payment Link brand settings on the Checkout [Branding settings page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/branding).\n\n[](#create-account)\n\nWhen a seller or service provider signs up on your marketplace, you need to create a user account (referred to as a _connected account_) so you can move funds to their bank account. Connected accounts represent your sellers or service providers. In our T-shirt marketplace example, the connected account represents the artist making the shirts.\n\n### Step 1.1: Create a connected account onboarding link ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\n*   Go to the [accounts overview page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/accounts/overview) and click **+Create** to create a new connected account.\n*   Select **Express** for account type and select the country where this connected account is located. Stripe allows platforms in supported countries to [create connected accounts in other Stripe-supported countries](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/express-accounts#onboarding-express-accounts-outside-of-your-platforms-country).\n*   Click **Continue** to generate the onboarding link that you can then share with your seller or service provider over email, SMS, or other private means. Don’t share this link publicly.\n\n![The create account modal displaying a generated Express link for onboarding a connected account](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/no-code-connect-express-link.40a3af1fdd03417e6560d3327db55961.png)\n\nCreate an onboarding link\n\nThis link directs sellers and service providers to a sign-up form where they can provide their identity and bank account information to onboard to your marketplace. In our example of a T-shirt marketplace, share this link with the T-shirt artist to onboard them. This link expires after 90 days and is for use by a single seller or service provider. After they complete the onboarding flow, you can see their account details in your [accounts list](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/accounts/overview). Repeat these steps any time you need to add additional sellers or service providers.\n\n![A single account displayed in the connected accounts list view](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/no-code-connect-connected-accounts.a62a6dc14ef6c95ae5a1e36801090945.png)\n\n[](#accept-payment)\n\nNow that you’ve created a connected account, create a Payment Link to accept payments from your customers—no coding required. When you send this link to your marketplace customer, they’ll land on a Stripe-hosted page where they can pay you. In the T-shirt marketplace example, customers buy T-shirts through your marketplace, and you pay T-shirt artists for designing and creating the T-shirts. To set this up, click on **+Create link** on the [Payment Links page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/payment-links) and follow the steps.\n\n### Step 2.1: Add the product ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nYou configure Payment Links for a specific product and price so the first step is to [add the product](https://support.stripe.com/questions/how-to-create-products-and-prices) you want to sell. Click on **+Add new product** to add a product.\n\n![The first page of the payment link creation form](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/no-code-connect-empty-payment-link.9885cf82263d39d2be55c4fbdcbcbb9f.png)\n\nSet your product name, description, and price, which are all visible to the customer on the Checkout page that you redirect them to. After entering the information for your new product click **+Add product** to add the product. In this example, we’re adding a medium-sized tree-patterned T-shirt product, so we’ll configure the Payment Link for this particular product. If we also wanted to sell small-sized T-shirts or T-shirts with other designs, we would follow the above steps to create a new Payment Link and a new product.\n\n![The product creation modal found within the payment link creation form](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/no-code-connect-create-product.ce265a710c21ecb80ac7715dc240721a.png)\n\n### Step 2.2: Customize the Payment Link ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nYou can customize your Payment Link to allow customers to enter promotion codes, adjust the quantity of the product, or enter their shipping and billing address. For our example of a T-shirt marketplace, we want to allow customers to buy a variable number of T-shirts. We also need to collect the customer’s shipping address so we can ship the T-shirts to them. To enable both of these, select **Let customers adjust quantity** and **Collect customers’ addresses** then click **Next**.\n\n### Step 2.3: Decide when to pay your connected account ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nYou have two options for paying out your connected account.\n\n*   If you already know which connected account you want to pay using funds collected through this Payment Link, you can automatically pay out.\n*   However, if you don’t know the connected account ahead of time or need to pay multiple connected accounts, you can pay out later.\n\n#### Select the connected account to pay![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nSelect the checkbox that says **Split the payment with a connected account**. Selecting this checkbox allows a connected account to automatically get paid when a customer buys the product through this Payment Link. In our example, we want to automatically pay Jamie, the T-shirt artist, whenever a customer buys their T-shirt. To do that, we specify Jamie as the connected account.\n\n#### Specify the application fee for the platform ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nTo keep a portion of the payment for your marketplace, you can specify an application fee. This is a fixed amount for each payment that uses this payment link. It doesn’t change based on quantity, discounts, or taxes, and we cap it at the total purchase amount. In our example, our T-shirt marketplace takes a 1 USD application fee per sale and sends the remaining payment (9 USD) to the T-shirt artist. If the customer purchases two T-shirts, uses a promotion code, or needs to pay additional taxes on top of their 10 USD purchase, the T-shirt marketplace still receives a 1 USD application fee per sale. For products with recurring payments (subscriptions), you can specify an application fee as a percentage of the total transaction value.\n\n![The second page of the payment link creation form. This page includes options for routing funds to connected accounts.](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/no-code-connect-create-payment-link-page-2.465b89cd12b53c1e3e623a0a3b03ffb0.png)\n\nAfter configuring the Payment Link to split the payment with your connected account, click **+Create link** to generate the Payment Link URL.\n\nAfter the customer pays, Stripe transfers the entire amount to the connected account’s pending balance and then transfers the application fee amount to the platform’s account as revenue for facilitating the sale. Then Stripe deducts the Stripe fees from the platform’s application fee. Under the hood, this funds flow is called a [destination charge](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges).\n\n[](#share-payment-link)\n\nNow that you’ve created your Payment Link, copy the Payment Link URL and share it publicly on your website or through social media. When a customer clicks on your Payment Link URL, they see your customized Checkout page (example below) and can enter their payment information—they can pay from mobile or desktop with a card, Apple Pay, or Google Pay.\n\n[](#after-payment)\n\n### Step 4.1 View your payments ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nGo to the [Payments page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/payments) to see the list of payments your business has accepted. You can click on an individual payment to see more details about it, such as the shipping address if you chose to collect one. You can see the [application fees](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/application_fees) your business collected for each payment, or go to the [Balance page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/balance/overview) to see your total funds.\n\n### Step 4.2 Fulfillment ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nAfter the payment completes, you need to handle fulfillment of the product. In the T-shirt marketplace example, this would entail shipping the T-shirts to the buyer after payment.\n\nAs the [settlement merchant](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges#settlement-merchant) on charges, your platform is responsible for disputes. Make sure you understand the [best practices](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/responding) for responding to disputes.\n\nBy default, any funds that you transfer to a connected account accumulate in the connected account’s [Stripe balance](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-balances) and are paid out on a daily rolling basis. You can change the [payout](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts \"payout\") frequency by going into the connected account’s detail page, clicking the right-most button in the **Balance** section, and selecting **Edit payout schedule**.\n\nTo issue refunds, go to the [Payments](https://dashboard.stripe.com/payments) page. Select individual payments by clicking the checkbox to the left of any payments you want to refund. After you select a payment, Stripe displays a **Refund** button in the upper-right corner of the page. Click the **Refund** button to issue a refund to customers for all payments you have selected.",

  "markdown": "# Risk management with Connect | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Learn how Connect can help you manage risk and losses.\n\nAll business owners assume a certain amount of risk when accepting payments for goods and services. This guide defines the risks to consider as a Connect platform owner and the approaches you can take to mitigate those risks.\n\n## Components of payments risk![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nAny approach to risk management involves many potential sources of payments risk, which can be split into two general categories:\n\n*   **Transaction risk**: The risk that a customer might charge back a transaction, such as [disputes](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes) or fraud identified from card testing. With [direct charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges), transaction risk primarily affects connected accounts; with [destination charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges) and [separate charges and transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers), transaction risk primarily affects platforms.\n*   **Merchant risk**: The risk that a connected account is unable or unwilling to cover the costs of chargebacks on its transactions, leading to unrecoverable negative balances. Merchant risk primarily affects platforms.\n\nThere are two main types of merchant risk: credit risk and fraud risk. Both can result in chargebacks and unrecoverable negative balances.\n\n| Type | Description | Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Credit risk | The risk that connected accounts are unable to fulfill their obligations to their customers, such as failing to deliver orders due to unforeseen supply issues. If a connected account accumulates more refunds and chargebacks than it can financially cover, it can result in default. | During the COVID pandemic, some hotels and short-term accommodation providers represented by connected accounts went out of business. As a result, customers who had pre-paid for future stays submitted chargebacks, which were covered by the platforms that processed those payments. |\n| Fraud risk | The risk that dishonest owners or employees of connected accounts intentionally don’t fulfill their obligations to their customers, such as taking orders for unavailable goods and services. | *   **No intent to deliver**: A fraudulent online storefront charged customers for goods that they didn’t intend to deliver. The connected account then paid out the money to their external bank account. When the customers realized that their orders were never going to arrive, they submitted chargebacks, which were covered by the platform.<br>*   **Payment method cashing**: A fraudster stole a customer’s credit card number, opened a connected account, and made purchases through that account using the stolen payment method credentials. When the customer discovered the fraudulent charges, they submitted chargebacks, which were covered by the platform. |\n\n## Connect merchant risk options![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nEach connected account’s Account object has a [controller.losses.payments](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-controller-losses-payments) property that determines who’s [responsible for covering any negative payments balance](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/risk-management \"negative balance liability\") on that account.\n\n#### Note\n\nThe `controller.losses.payments` property applies only to the connected account’s payments balance. It doesn’t affect responsibility for covering negative Issuing or Treasury balances.\n\nYou can select whether you or Stripe is responsible for negative balance liabilities on your accounts. Because your choice of negative balance liability can significantly impact your platform and connected accounts, consider it carefully before onboarding any accounts. This table describes some important elements of the decision:\n\n|     | Stripe | Platform |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| [API value](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-controller-losses-payments) | `stripe` | `application` |\n| Losses | Stripe covers losses due to your connected accounts’ negative balances. | Your platform can incur losses due to your connected accounts’ negative balances. |\n| Operational responsibilities | Stripe’s risk teams fully manage all payments-related merchant risk. | The platform maintains an internal risk team capable of adequately managing all payments-related merchant risk. |\n| Connected account experience | Stripe directly contacts your connected accounts to prevent, mitigate, and resolve payments risk-related issues, and in some cases can take action against them. | Your platform has a greater degree of control over the payments risk-related experience of your connected accounts. |\n| Stripe fees | If you pay Stripe’s listed prices for other fees, we don’t charge additional fees for negative balance liability. | Stripe charges no additional fees. |\n\nWe recommend that new platforms have Stripe take responsibility for negative balances on connected accounts. Only consider taking responsibility as the platform if you’re highly confident in your ability to manage merchant risk.\n\n## Stripe solutions for risk management![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nStripe provides a variety of solutions to help manage both transaction and merchant risk. These solutions fall into two categories:\n\n*   **Tools to manage risk**: Tools that Stripe provides to help platforms manage risks without Stripe being liable for any resulting losses.\n*   **Full service risk management**: Risk-management services that Stripe provides where Stripe covers the costs of any resulting losses.\n\nThis table describes the main solution that Stripe provides in each category for each type of risk:\n\n| Risk type | Tools to manage risk | Full service risk management |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Transaction risk | [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar): Scans every payment to help detect and prevent fraud. | [Chargeback protection](https://stripe.com/radar/chargeback-protection): Protects your platform and connected accounts from disputes by covering both disputed amounts and any dispute fees. |\n| Merchant risk | **Merchant risk tooling**: Tools that help your risk teams prevent, detect, and mitigate risks posed by your connected accounts. | [Stripe Managed Risk](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/risk-management/managed-risk): A full-service solution that protects your platform by managing risk and covering any negative balances on your connected accounts. |\n\n## Know Your Customer (KYC) and compliance![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nIn addition to operational risk management solutions, Stripe provides KYC and risk-based screening to help onboard connected accounts and maintain compliance with evolving regulations. Stripe screens include the following:\n\n*   Identity verifications\n*   Risk-based KYC and AML checks for individuals and businesses\n*   Sanctions screening\n*   MATCH (Member Alert To Control High-risk businesses) list checks\n*   Secure credit card data tokenization for PCI compliance\n*   Money transmitter licenses (MTL) in the US and e-money (EMI) licenses in the EU\n*   [Prohibited business checks](https://stripe.com/legal/restricted-businesses)",

  "markdown": "# Stripe-hosted onboarding | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Onboard connected accounts by redirecting them to a Stripe-hosted onboarding flow.\n\nStripe-hosted onboarding handles the collection of business and identity verification information from connected accounts. It’s a web form hosted by Stripe that adjusts dynamically based on the capabilities, country, and business type of each connected account. Stripe-hosted onboarding is the recommended solution for platform’s looking for Stripe to take care of onboarding with little effort from the platform.\n\n[](#customize-onboarding-form)\n\nGo to the [Connect settings page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/applications/settings) in the Dashboard to customize the visual appearance of the form with your brand’s name, color, and icon. Stripe-hosted onboarding requires this information. Stripe also recommends [collecting bank account information](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect/payouts/onboarding) from your connected accounts as they’re onboarding.\n\n[](#create-account)\n\nCreate a [connected account](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts) with the default [controller](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/create#create_account-controller) properties. See [design an integration](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/design-an-integration) to learn more about controller properties. Alternatively, you can create a connected account by specifying an account [type](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/create#create_account-type).\n\n`curl -X POST https://api.stripe.com/v1/accounts \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\"`\n\nIf you know the country for your connected account, you can provide that information when you create the account. The country defaults to the same country as your platform if not provided.\n\nIf you need to request [capabilities](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-capabilities) for your connected account, you can provide that information when you create the account and Stripe’s onboarding UIs collect the requirements for those capabilities. To reduce onboarding effort, request only the capabilities you need. If you omit capabilities and your connected account has Express Dashboard access, Stripe-hosted onboarding uses the [Configuration settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect/onboarding-options/countries) to automatically request capabilities based on the account’s country.\n\nIf you have information about the account holder (like their name, address, or other details), you can proactively provide this when you [create](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/create) or [update](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/update) the account. Stripe-hosted onboarding asks the account holder to confirm the pre-filled information before accepting the [Connect service agreement](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/service-agreement-types). Providing more information through the API reduces the number of prompts and enhances the onboarding flow for your connected account.\n\nAdditionally, if you onboard an account without its own website and your platform provides the account with a URL, prefill the account’s [business\\_profile.url](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/create#create_account-business_profile-url). If the account doesn’t have a URL, you can prefill its [business\\_profile.product\\_description](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/create#create_account-business_profile-product_description) instead.\n\nWhen testing your integration, use [test data](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/testing) to simulate different outcomes including identity verification, business information verification, payout failures, and more.\n\n[](#info-to-collect)\n\nAs the platform, you must decide if you want to collect the required information from your connected accounts upfront or incrementally. Upfront onboarding collects the `eventually_due` requirements for the account, while incremental onboarding only collects the `currently_due` requirements.\n\n|     | Upfront onboarding | Incremental onboarding |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Advantages** | *   Entails a single request for information (normally)<br>*   Creates fewer problems in receiving payouts and maintaining processing ability<br>*   Exposes potential fraudsters or connected accounts who refuse to provide required information later | *   Onboards connected accounts quickly<br>*   Results in higher onboarding rates |\n| **Disadvantages** | *   Onboarding connected accounts can take longer<br>*   Some legitimate new connected accounts might turn away due to the amount of information required before they complete the onboarding process | *   Creates a higher likelihood of disrupting business of an ongoing connected account |\n\nTo determine whether to use upfront or incremental onboarding, review the [required information](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information) for the countries where your connected accounts are located to understand the requirements that are eventually due. While Stripe tries to minimize any impact to connected accounts, requirements might change over time.\n\n[](#create-account-link)\n\nCreate an [Account Link](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_links) using the connected account ID and include a [refresh URL](#refresh-url) and a [return URL](#return-url). Stripe redirects the connected account to the refresh URL if the Account Link URL has already been visited, has expired, or is otherwise invalid. Stripe redirects connected accounts to the return URL when they have completed or left the onboarding flow. Additionally, based on the information you need to collect, pass either `currently_due` or `eventually_due` for `collection_options.fields`. This example passes `eventually_due` to use upfront onboarding. Set to `currently_due` for incremental onboarding.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/account_links \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d account=  {{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}   \\   --data-urlencode refresh_url=\"[https://example.com/refresh](https://example.com/refresh)\" \\   --data-urlencode return_url=\"[https://example.com/return](https://example.com/return)\" \\  -d type=account_onboarding \\  -d \"collection_options[fields]\"=eventually_due`\n\n### Redirect your connected account to the Account Link URL ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nRedirect the connected account to the Account Link URL to send them to the onboarding flow. Each Account Link URL can only be used once because it grants access to the account holder’s personal information. Authenticate the account in your application before redirecting them to this URL.\n\n[\n\n## Handle new requirements becoming due![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n\n\n](#handle-new-requirements-becoming-due)\n\nSet up your integration to [listen for changes](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/handling-api-verification#verification-process) to account requirements. You can test handling new requirements (and how they might disable charges and payouts) with the [test mode trigger cards](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/testing#trigger-cards). Stripe notifies you when [upcoming requirements updates](https://support.stripe.com/user/questions/onboarding-requirements-updates) affect your connected accounts.\n\nYou can proactively collect information to fulfill [future requirements](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-future_requirements). Based on the verification needs of your application, send the connected account back into onboarding as necessary to satisfy `currently_due` or `eventually_due` requirements. You can use this as a signal of when to send your connected account back into the flow.\n\nYou don’t need to worry about what the requirements are—sending the connected account back into onboarding collects the right information. For example, if your connected account mistypes their information and they can’t be verified, they could be asked to provide an identity document (for example, a Driver’s License in the United States). Sending this user into onboarding prompts them to upload such a document to make sure they’re verified.\n\n### Handle verification errors ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nListen to the [account.updated](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-account.updated) event. If the account contains any `currently_due` fields when the `current_deadline` arrives, the corresponding functionality is disabled and those fields are added to `past_due`.\n\nLet your accounts remediate their verification requirements by directing them to the Stripe-hosted onboarding form.\n\n## Handle the connected account returning to your platform![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe Account Link requires a `refresh_url` and `return_url` to handle all cases in which the connected account is redirected back to your platform. It’s important to implement these correctly to provide the best onboarding flow for your connected accounts.\n\n#### Note\n\nYou can use HTTP for your `refresh_url` and `return_url` while you’re in test mode (for example, to test locally), but for live mode only HTTPS is accepted. Be sure you’ve swapped any testing URLs for HTTPS URLs before going live.\n\n### Refresh URL ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nYour connected account is redirected to the `refresh_url` when:\n\n*   The link is expired (a few minutes went by since the link was created).\n*   The link was already visited (the connected account refreshed the page or clicked the **back** or **forward** button).\n*   The link was shared in a third-party application such as a messaging client that attempts to access the URL to preview it. Many clients automatically visit links which causes them to become expired.\n\nThe `refresh_url` should call a method on your server to create a new [Account Link](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_links) with the same parameters and redirect the connected account to the new Account Link URL.\n\n### Return URL ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nStripe redirects the connected account back to this URL when they complete the onboarding flow or click **Save for later** at any point in the flow. It **does not** mean that all information has been collected, or that there are no outstanding requirements on the account. It only means the flow was entered and exited properly.\n\nNo state is passed with this URL. After a connected account is redirected to the `return_url`, determine if the account has completed onboarding. [Retrieve](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/retrieve) the account and check the [requirements](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-requirements) attribute for outstanding requirements. Or, listen to the `account.updated` event sent to your webhook endpoint and cache the state of the account in your application. If the account hasn’t completed onboarding, provide prompts in your application to allow them to continue onboarding later.\n\n## Handle connected account-initiated updates![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nStripe-hosted onboarding also supports connected account-initiated updates to the information they’ve already provided. When you create an Account Link, you can set the `type` to either `account_onboarding` or `account_update`.\n\n### Account onboarding![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nAccount Links of this type provide a form for inputting outstanding requirements. Use it when you’re onboarding a new connected account, or when an existing user has new requirements (such as when a connected account had already provided enough information, but you requested a new capability that needs additional info). Send them to this type of Account Link to just collect the new information you need.\n\n### Account update![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nAccount Links of this type are enabled for accounts where your platform is responsible for requirement collection. `account_update` links display the attributes that are already populated on the account object and allows your connected account to edit previously provided information (for example, they need to update their address). Provide an option in your application (for example, “edit my profile” or “update my verification information”) for connected accounts to make updates themselves.\n\n## Supported browsers![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nStripe-hosted onboarding supports:\n\n*   The last 20 major versions of Chrome and Firefox\n*   The last two major versions of Safari and Edge\n*   The last two major versions of mobile Safari on iOS\n\nStripe-hosted onboarding isn’t supported when embedded through webviews. It’s only supported in standalone browsers.",

  "markdown": "# Platform pricing tools | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Platform pricing toolsBeta\n\n## Design personalized pricing strategies with our no-code UI tool designed for platforms.\n\nPlatform pricing tools enable you to store pricing logic within Stripe for monetization, reducing the effort needed to successfully integrate. As a beta feature, your platform needs to have permissions to access the platform pricing tools.\n\nPlatform pricing tools allow you to create pricing schemes that apply different application fees based on the properties of a transaction, without having to pass an application fee amount through the API. These pricing schemes apply to activity on your connected accounts where your platform is responsible for the Stripe fees.\n\n## Request an invite![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n## Create a pricing scheme![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nA pricing scheme is a list of conditional fees that Stripe evaluates from top to bottom, with a default fee applied to any transactions that don’t match a defined condition exactly. A conditional fee is made up of a fee and a set of conditions. When a transaction occurs, Stripe applies the first matching conditional fee (from top to bottom). If no conditional fees match the transaction, Stripe uses the default fee.\n\n1.  Go to the [Connect settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect) page in your Stripe Dashboard.\n2.  Click [Platform pricing](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect/platform_pricing) to go to your Platform pricing page.\n3.  Click **Add rules** to open the **Set a default payment pricing scheme** dialog.\n4.  Click **Add pricing rule** to create a new conditional fee rule. Use the dropdown menus to define the rule. Stripe calculates the fee in the specified currency, and then converts it to the settlement currency of the payment, if needed. You can add multiple pricing rules for the same pricing scheme, and they will be evaluated in the order that you select.\n    *   **Condition**: Use the dropdown menus to define a condition that the rule applies to. The options available for the right input depend on the selection you make on the left dropdown, For more information about conditions on specific transactions, see [Products](#products).\n    *   **Fee type**: Select **Fixed**, **Variable**, or **Blended**.\n        *   **Fixed**: Charge a specific amount. For example, charge 1.10 USD for every payment.\n        *   **Variable**: Charge a percentage of the total amount of the payment. For example, charge .45% of the total payment amount.\n            *   **Minimum (optional)**: Specify a lower bound for the fee amount. For example, charge at least 0.50 USD for every payment.\n            *   **Maximum (optional)**: Specify an upper bound for the fee amount. For example, cap every fee at 2.00 USD.\n        *   **Blended**: Charge a specific amount on top of a percentage of the total payment. For example, charge 1.10 USD for every transaction in addition to .45% of the total payment amount.\n            *   **Maximum (optional)**: Specify an upper bound for the fee amount. For example, cap every fee at 2.00 USD.\n5.  Under **Set fallback rule**, set a variable amount, fixed amount, or both. Use the Fixed dropdown to select the appropriate currency for the fixed amount. Stripe applies the default fee rule if any of the conditional fees you set aren’t matched by a particular transaction. The default fee must be a non-zero amount. You can’t have a zero percentage variable amount and a zero fixed amount.\n6.  (Optional) Click the **Add modifier** if you want to take the calculated application fee and either mark it up or discount it by a certain percentage.\n7.  Click **Save**. Alternatively, click **X** at the top to close the dialog without saving the conditions you created.\n8.  If you’re passing in an explicit `application_fee` or `transfer_data[amount]` parameter on a payment, they take precedence over the no-code pricing schemes. To apply the configured pricing, stop passing in these parameters.\n\nWhen you save the pricing scheme, Stripe automatically copies the pricing scheme to all of your connected accounts. The time it takes to update all your accounts depends on the number of connected accounts on your platform. Stripe displays a notice with the progress update in the [Connect settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/settings/connect/setup) page.\n\n## Override a specific account![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nAfter you set up a pricing scheme, you can override the rules for connected accounts that don’t have access to the full Stripe Dashboard (including Express and Custom accounts).\n\n1.  Select the account from the [Connected accounts page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/accounts/overview) in your Dashboard.\n2.  On the connected account details page, click **Customize pricing** in the **Account pricing** section for **COLLECT APPLICATION FEES ON PAYMENTS** to open the **Customize pricing** dialog. If an overridden pricing scheme already exists, click **Edit** to open the dialog and make changes.\n    \n    ![Account pricing section with the Customize pricing button highlighted.](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/customize-pricing.6839b07bcee32ec7ad40a4dd9b3c6ca0.png)\n    \n3.  If you’re creating a new override, Stripe provides the option to start a blank pricing scheme **(Create a new scheme)** or to copy the pricing scheme set at the platform level as a starting point **(Copy from your platform’s pricing scheme)**. If you want to make small adjustments to a complex pricing scheme of your platform, click the **Copy from your platform’s pricing scheme** button. Otherwise, click **Create new pricing** to build a new pricing scheme from scratch.\n    \n    ![Customize account pricing dialog with Cancel, Create new pricing, and Copy pricing buttons.](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/custom-dialog.1dbb42ae35cdac263dff5a412e81a43c.png)\n    \n4.  Set the desired conditional and default fees as described in the preceding [Create a pricing scheme](#create-a-pricing-scheme) section.\n    \n    ![Customize account pricing rule editor.](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/customize-pricing-dialog.abf5ceefac307b3299f2c860782a8309.png)\n    \n5.  Click **Save** to save the override. Alternatively, click **X** at the top to close the dialog without saving. You’ll be prompted to **Confirm** the changes.\n\nSubsequent edits to the platform pricing scheme don’t update the pricing scheme of overridden connected accounts.\n\n## Revert overridden pricing schemes![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYou can revert overridden pricing schemes on the account details page. Click **Revert to platform pricing** in the **Account pricing** section of a connected account details page to use the platform’s pricing scheme for the connected account.\n\n![Account pricing section with Revert to platform pricing button highlighted.](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/revert.151b51aa9959624829112e773e26faa4.png)\n\nRevert to platform pricing\n\n## Products![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n### Pricing scheme application![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nStripe applies pricing schemes to a payment when all of the following are true:\n\n*   The pricing scheme is enabled.\n*   Your platform is responsible for the Stripe fees on the payment.\n*   The account is in a country that your platform is eligible to take application fees for.\n*   The `application_fee` or `transfer_data[amount]` parameters aren’t present on the payment. An explicit `application_fee` or `transfer_data[amount]` always takes precedence over managed application fees.\n*   The payment did not use multi-capture\n*   The amount used to calculate a fee is the captured amount of the payment. If the payment is a card charge authorized for 10 USD, and only 5 USD is captured, 5 USD is the amount used to compute the fee.\n\n### Conditions![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n| Field | Applies to | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Payment method | All payments | The payment method used, for example `card`, `us_bank_account`, or `boleto` |\n| Presentment currency | All payments | The currency that the customer paid in |\n| Settlement merchant country | All payments | The country of the payment settlement merchant |\n| Card brand | Card payments | The type of card used, for example Visa or Mastercard |\n| Card present | Card payments | Whether or not the payment is in-person |\n| Card country | Card payments | The country of the card that the customer paid with |\n| Card product code | Card payments | The [product code](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/platform-pricing-tools/card-product-codes) of the card that the customer paid with |\n| Card type | Card payments | Funding source of the card, such as a credit card or debit card |\n| Card product category | Card payments | Card [class classification](https://support.stripe.com/questions/what-s-the-difference-between-standard-and-premium-cards), such as a Standard or Premium card |\n| Klarna payment category | Klarna payments | The [Klarna payment category](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/object#charge_object-payment_method_details-klarna-payment_method_category) used on a Klarna payment |\n\n### Fee modifier![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nA fee modifier can either be a discount or markup. A markup applies a percent increase on the fee amount, whereas a discount applies a percent decrease. These will be calculated on the fee amount determined by the conditional and fallback rules.\n\nModifiers will compound based on the order they were added. For example, a 5% discount followed by a 10% markup will adjust a $1.00 fee to a $1.05 fee ($1.00 \\* 0.95 \\* 1.1 = $1.05).\n\n### Interaction with subscriptions and invoices![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nStripe applies managed application fees, configured in pricing tools, on [invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing) and [subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing) payments.\n\nIf you provide an [application fee amount](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create#create_invoice-application_fee_amount) when creating an invoice, that fee takes precedence and Stripe doesn’t apply the configured managed application fee.\n\nIf you provide an [application fee percent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/object#subscription_object-application_fee_percent) on a subscription, that fee takes precedence and Stripe doesn’t apply the configured managed application fee.\n\nDifferent roles have different levels of access to pricing schemes.\n\nAlthough some roles don’t have access to the platform’s default pricing, they might be able to deduce it based on the version copied to the connected accounts.\n\n| Role | Permissions |\n| --- | --- |\n| Administrator | Read/Write |\n| Developer | None |\n| IAM Admin | None |\n| Connect Onboarding Analyst | None |\n| Transfer Analyst | None |\n| Analyst | None |\n| Dispute Analyst | None |\n| Refund Analyst | None |\n| Support Specialist | None |\n| Support Only | None |\n| Tax Analyst | None |\n| View Only | None |\n| Topups Only | None |",

  "markdown": "# Set statement descriptors with Connect\n\n## Learn how statement descriptors work for charges with Connect.\n\nStatement descriptors explain charges or payments on bank statements and include information that banks and card networks require to help customers understand their statements. Familiarize yourself with the [requirements for statement descriptors](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/statement-descriptors).\n\n## Set the static component for a connected account![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nStatement descriptors contain a static component and, optionally, a dynamic part. The static component refers to either:\n\n*   The entire statement descriptor is static ([settings.payments.statement\\_descriptor](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-settings-payments-statement_descriptor)).\n*   The first half of the statement descriptor is static ([settings.card\\_payments.statement\\_descriptor\\_prefix](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-settings-card_payments-statement_descriptor_prefix)) and the second half is dynamically set from the payment.\n\nYour platform and connected accounts with the `card_payments` capability must have a statement descriptor and, optionally, a statement descriptor prefix. Both values must be at least 5 characters in length. For a given payment, the statement descriptor of the platform or the connected account applies depending on [the charge type](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/charges).\n\nThe statement descriptor is set in one of the following ways:\n\n*   With a [create or update account](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts) API call\n*   During Stripe-hosted or embedded onboarding\n*   Through the full Stripe Dashboard or Express Dashboard\n\nConnected accounts with access to a Stripe-hosted dashboard can update their own statement descriptor settings.\n\nYou can prefill an account’s statement descriptor and prefix when you call the [create account](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/create) endpoint. During Stripe-hosted or embedded onboarding, If `settings.payments.statement_descriptor` or `settings.card_payments.statement_descriptor_prefix` isn’t set, Stripe sets them based on information provided about the account during onboarding. If sufficient information isn’t available, Stripe prompts connected accounts to set their own statement descriptors during onboarding.\n\nAfter onboarding an account that doesn’t have access to the full Stripe Dashboard, you can update its `settings.payments.statement_descriptor` and `settings.card_payments.statement_descriptor_prefix` by calling the [update account](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/update) endpoint.\n\nFor accounts where the platform handles onboarding, you must set their statement descriptor.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/accounts \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d \"controller[stripe_dashboard][type]\"=none \\  -d \"controller[fees][payer]\"=application \\  -d \"controller[losses][payments]\"=application \\  -d \"controller[requirement_collection]\"=application \\  -d country=US \\  -d business_type=company \\  -d \"business_profile[name]\"=\"Runners Club\" \\  -d \"capabilities[card_payments][requested]\"=true \\  -d \"capabilities[transfers][requested]\"=true \\  -d \"settings[payments][statement_descriptor]\"=\"RUNNERS CLUB\"`\n\nAs of [API version 2023-10-16](https://docs.stripe.com/upgrades#2023-10-16), there is new logic around updating statement descriptors.\n\n*   If you update an account’s `business_profile.name`, `business_profile.url`, or the name of the company or individual and the existing statement descriptor is based on lower precedence data, Stripe automatically resets the statement descriptor to match the higher precedence value. For example, if the statement descriptor is automatically set based on the URL, then you set or update `business_profile.name`, Stripe resets the statement descriptor to match the business profile name. If the statement descriptor is automatically set based on `business_profile.name`, and you set or update the name of the company or individual, the statement descriptor doesn’t reset because `business_profile.name` has higher precedence. The precedence order is `business_profile.name`, `business_profile.url`, then the name of the company or individual.\n*   Any update to an account’s full statement descriptor causes Stripe to automatically set the statement descriptor prefix to a shortened version of the updated statement descriptor, even if the previous prefix is manually set.\n\n## Statement descriptor usage![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe full statement descriptor is provided to the bank or card network processing the payment. Only the first 22 characters of the full statement descriptor are sent for card payments.\n\nThe customer’s statement uses the connected account’s static component for the following charge types:\n\n*   Direct charges\n*   Destination charges with `on_behalf_of`\n*   Separate charges and transfers with `on_behalf_of`\n\n#### Caution\n\nThe platform provides the static component for `/v1/charges` requests with `on_behalf_of` for API versions before `2019-02-19`.\n\nUsing the static component on connected accounts requires the [card\\_payments](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-capabilities#card-payments) capability.\n\nThe customer’s statement uses the platform account’s static component for the following charge types:\n\n*   Destination charges without `on_behalf_of`\n*   Separate charges and transfers without `on_behalf_of`\n\nAny additional information that’s displayed on a customer’s statement is also provided by the account that provides the static component (for example, support address or support phone number). If the connected account hasn’t provided this information, `on_behalf_of` charges use the platform account’s information.\n\nIf you use a dynamic suffix on a charge that uses the connected account’s static descriptor, you can set a prefix to ensure the complete statement descriptor appears as intended.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/accounts \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d \"controller[stripe_dashboard][type]\"=none \\  -d \"controller[fees][payer]\"=application \\  -d \"controller[losses][payments]\"=application \\  -d \"controller[requirement_collection]\"=application \\  -d country=US \\  -d business_type=company \\  -d \"capabilities[card_payments][requested]\"=true \\  -d \"capabilities[transfers][requested]\"=true \\  -d \"settings[card_payments][statement_descriptor_prefix]\"=RUNCLUB`\n\nThe static prefix must contain between 2 and 10 characters, inclusive. Card networks receive only the first 22 characters (including the `*` symbol and the space that concatenates the static prefix and dynamic suffix) of the complete statement descriptor.\n\nSet the `statement_descriptor` and `statement_descriptor_prefix` for flexibility in setting statement descriptors on charges.\n\nIf the statement descriptor is set on card charges and no prefix is set, Stripe truncates the account statement descriptor as needed to set the prefix value.\n\n## Set a dynamic suffix for connected account charges ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nDynamic suffixes are supported only for card charges by using the `statement_descriptor_suffix` parameter. You can read more about [dynamic suffixes](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/statement-descriptors#dynamic) or see the concatenated statement descriptors (prefix\\* suffix) in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/public).\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/payment_intents \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -H \"Stripe-Account:   {{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}  \" \\  -d amount=1000 \\  -d currency=usd \\  -d \"payment_method_types[]\"=card \\  -d statement_descriptor_suffix=\"Custom suffix\"`\n\n## Set Japanese statement descriptors![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nWe recommend setting the static components of kanji and kana statement descriptors for Japanese connected accounts.

  "markdown": "# API onboarding | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Build your own onboarding flow using Stripe's APIs.\n\nWith API onboarding, you use the [Accounts API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts) to build an onboarding flow, reporting functionality, and communication channels for your users. Stripe can be completely invisible to the account holder.\n\nYour platform is responsible for all interactions with your users and for collecting all the information needed to verify the account. Verification requirements are updated as laws and regulations change around the world.\n\n[](#establish-requirements)\n\nThe following factors affect the [onboarding requirements](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information) for your connected accounts:\n\n*   The origin country of the connected accounts\n*   The [service agreement type](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/service-agreement-types) applicable to the connected accounts\n*   The [capabilities](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-capabilities) requested for the connected accounts\n*   The [business type](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-business_type) (for example, individual or company) and [company.structure](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-company-structure) (for example, public corporation or private partnership)\n\nUse the interactive form to see how changing these factors affects the requirements.\n\n### Requirements form![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n[](#create-forms-to-collect-information)\n\nAs a best practice, organize the required parameters into logical groupings or forms in your onboarding flow. You might wish to encode a mapping between the Stripe parameters and the logical groupings. Suggested logical groupings for parameters are shown in the first column of the example requirements table.\n\nAfter you encode the required parameters into your application, generate UIs for the parameters corresponding to these requirements. For each parameter, design a UI form that includes:\n\n*   Parameter label, localized to each supported country and language\n*   Parameter description, localized to each supported country and language\n*   Parameter input fields with data validation logic and document uploading where required\n\nIt’s important to architect your application logic to account for the possibility of additional parameters in the future. For example, Stripe might introduce new parameters, new verifications, or new thresholds that you must incorporate into your onboarding flows over time.\n\nChanging any of the factors that determine your connected accounts requirements means you must also adjust your collection forms. [Country](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-country) and [service agreement type](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-tos_acceptance-service_agreement) are immutable, while [capabilities](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-capabilities) and [business type](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-business_type) are mutable.\n\n*   To change an immutable field such as country or service agreement type, create a new connected account with the new values. Doing so produces new requirements for you to incorporate in your collection flows.\n*   To change a mutable field such as capabilities or business type, update the connected account. Doing so produces new requirements for you to incorporate in your collection flows.\n\n### Include Stripe Terms of Service Agreement![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYour connected accounts must accept Stripe terms of service before they can be activated. You can [wrap Stripe terms of service in your own terms of service](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/updating-service-agreements#adding-stripes-service-agreement-to-your-terms-of-service).\n\n[](#create-account)\n\nCreate a [connected account](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts) where your platform is liable for negative balances, Stripe collects fees from your platform account, and your connected accounts don’t have access to a Stripe-hosted dashboard. Request any capabilities that your connected accounts need. Include business type and any other information matching your [requirements](#establish-requirements) if you have it available to prefill.\n\nAlternatively, you can create a connected account with `type` set to `custom` and desired capabilities.\n\nIf you don’t specify the country and service type agreement, they’re assigned the following default values:\n\n*   The `country` defaults to the same country as your platform.\n*   The service type agreement (`tos_acceptance.service_agreement`) defaults to `full`.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/accounts \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d \"controller[losses][payments]\"=application \\  -d \"controller[fees][payer]\"=application \\  -d \"controller[stripe_dashboard][type]\"=none \\  -d \"controller[requirement_collection]\"=application \\  -d \"capabilities[card_payments][requested]\"=true \\  -d \"capabilities[transfers][requested]\"=true \\  -d business_type=individual \\  -d country=US`\n\n[](#determine-information-to-collect)\n\nAs the platform, you must decide if you want to collect the required information from your connected accounts upfront or incrementally. Upfront onboarding collects the `eventually_due` requirements for the account, while incremental onboarding only collects the `currently_due` requirements.\n\n|     | Upfront onboarding | Incremental onboarding |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Advantages** | *   Entails a single request for information (normally)<br>*   Creates fewer problems in receiving payouts and maintaining processing ability<br>*   Exposes potential fraudsters or connected accounts who refuse to provide required information later | *   Onboards connected accounts quickly<br>*   Results in higher onboarding rates |\n| **Disadvantages** | *   Onboarding connected accounts can take longer<br>*   Some legitimate new connected accounts might turn away due to the amount of information required before they complete the onboarding process | *   Creates a higher likelihood of disrupting business of an ongoing connected account |\n\nTo determine whether to use upfront or incremental onboarding, review the [required information](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information) for the countries where your connected accounts are located to understand the requirements that are eventually due. While Stripe tries to minimize any impact to connected accounts, requirements might change over time.\n\nTo implement your onboarding strategy, inspect the requirements hash of the connected account you created. The requirements hash provides a complete list of parameters you must collect to activate the connected account.\n\n*   For incremental onboarding, inspect the `currently_due` field in the requirements hash and build an onboarding flow that only collects for the listed parameters.\n*   For upfront onboarding, inspect the `eventually_due` field in the requirements hash and build an onboarding flow that collects for all the listed parameters.\n\n`{   ...   \"requirements\": {     \"alternatives\": [],     \"current_deadline\": null,     \"currently_due\": [       \"business_profile.product_description\",       \"business_profile.support_phone\",       \"business_profile.url\",       \"external_account\",       \"tos_acceptance.date\",       \"tos_acceptance.ip\"     ],     \"disabled_reason\": \"requirements.past_due\",     \"errors\": [],     \"eventually_due\": [       \"business_profile.product_description\",       \"business_profile.support_phone\",       \"business_profile.url\",       \"external_account\",       \"tos_acceptance.date\",       \"tos_acceptance.ip\"     ],     \"past_due\": [],     \"pending_verification\": []   },   ... }`\n\n[](#update-the-connected-account)\n\n[Update](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/update) the connected account object with new information as your user progresses through each step of the onboarding flow to allow Stripe to validate the information as soon as it’s added. After Stripe confirms acceptance of our terms of service, any changes to the connected account triggers reverification. For example, if you change the connected account’s name and ID number, Stripe reruns verifications.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/accounts/`\n\n`{{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}`\n\n `\\  -u \"  sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc  :\" \\   --data-urlencode \"business_profile[url]\"=\"[https://furever.dev](https://furever.dev/)\" \\  -d \"tos_acceptance[date]\"=1609798905 \\  -d \"tos_acceptance[ip]\"=\"8.8.8.8\"`\n\nWhen updating a connected account, you must handle any [verification errors](#handle-verification-errors) or [HTTP error codes](https://docs.stripe.com/error-handling).\n\n[\n\n## Handle verification errors![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n\n\n](#handle-verification-errors)\n\nWhen the connected account’s data is submitted, Stripe verifies it. This process might take minutes or hours depending on the nature of the verification required. During this process, the capabilities you requested have [a pending status](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-capabilities).\n\n### Review status![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYou can retrieve the status of your connected account’s capabilities by:\n\n*   Inspecting the Account object’s [capabilities](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-capabilities) hash for the relevant capability.\n*   Requesting capabilities directly from the [Capabilities API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/capabilities/retrieve) and inspecting the status of the relevant capability.\n*   Listening for `account.updated` [events](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-account.updated) in your [webhook](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/webhooks) endpoint and inspecting the `capabilities` hash for the relevant capability.\n\nAfter verifications are complete, the capability becomes `active` and available to the connected account. Account verifications run continuously, and if a future verification fails, a capability can transition out of `active`. Listen for `account.updated` events to detect changes to capability states.\n\nConfirm that your Connect integration is compliant and operational by checking that the account’s `charges_enabled` and `payouts_enabled` are both true. You can use the API or listen for `account.updated` events. For details on other relevant fields, check the account’s [requirements](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-requirements) hash. You can’t confirm the integration based on a single value because statuses can vary depending on the application and related policies.\n\n*   [charges\\_enabled](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-charges_enabled) confirms that your full charge path including the charge and transfer works correctly and evaluates if either `card_payments` or `transfers` capabilities are active.\n*   [payouts\\_enabled](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-payouts_enabled) evaluates whether your connected account can pay out to an external account. Depending on your risk policies, you can allow your connected account to start transacting without payouts enabled. You [must eventually enable payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/manage-payout-schedule) to pay your connected accounts.\n\nYou can use the following logic as a starting point for defining a summary status to display to your connected account.\n\n`# Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production. # See your keys here: [https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys) Stripe.api_key =` \n\n`'sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc'`\n\n`def account_state(account)   reqs = account.requirements    if reqs.disabled_reason && reqs.disabled_reason.include?(\"rejected\")     \"rejected\"   elsif account.payouts_enabled && account.charges_enabled     if reqs.pending_verification       \"pending enablement\"     elsif !reqs.disabled_reason && !reqs.currently_due       if !reqs.eventually_due         \"complete\"       else         \"enabled\"       end     else       \"restricted\"     end   elsif !account.payouts_enabled && account.charges_enabled     \"restricted (payouts disabled)\"   elsif !account.charges_enabled && account.payouts_enabled     \"restricted (charges disabled)\"   elsif reqs.past_due     \"restricted (past due)\"   elsif reqs.pending_verification     \"pending (disabled)\"   else     \"restricted\"   end end  accounts = Stripe::Account.list(limit: 10)  accounts.each do |account|     puts \"#{account.id} has state: #{account_state(account)}\" end`\n\n#### Note\n\nYou can’t use the API to respond to Stripe risk reviews. You can enable your connected accounts to respond using embedded components, Stripe-hosted onboarding, or remediation links. You can also use the Dashboard to respond to risk reviews on behalf of your connected accounts.\n\nListen to the [account.updated](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-account.updated) event. If the account contains any `currently_due` fields when the `current_deadline` arrives, the corresponding functionality is disabled and those fields are added to `past_due`.\n\n[Create a form](#create-forms-to-collect-information) with clear instructions that the account can use to correct the information. Notify the account, then [submit the corrected information](#update-the-connected-account) using the Accounts API.\n\nIf you plan to create custom flows to handle all your verification errors:\n\n*   Review the details regarding all possible [verification errors and how to handle them](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/handling-api-verification).\n*   [Test verification states](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/testing-verification).",

With direct charges:\n\n*   The payment appears as a charge on the connected account, not your platform’s account.\n*   The connected account’s balance increases with every charge.\n*   Your account balance increases with application fees from every charge.\n\nThis charge type is best suited for platforms providing software as a service. For example, Shopify provides tools for building online storefronts, and Thinkific enables educators to sell online courses.\n\nRedirect to a Stripe-hosted payment page using [Stripe Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout). See how this integration [compares to Stripe’s other integration types](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment/web/compare-integrations).\n\n[![Checkout preview](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/b2c79a23390b89a7b589d29387f3e2b2.png)](https://checkout.stripe.dev/)\n\n### Integration effort\n\n### Integration type\n\nRedirect to Stripe-hosted payment page\n\n### UI customization\n\n[Try it out](https://checkout.stripe.dev/)\n\n[](#set-up-stripe)\n\nFirst, [register](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register) for a Stripe account.\n\nUse our official libraries to access the Stripe API from your application:\n\n`# Available as a gem sudo gem install stripe`\n\n`# If you use bundler, you can add this line to your Gemfile gem 'stripe'`\n\n[](#create-checkout-session)\n\nA [Checkout Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions) controls what your customer sees in the payment form such as line items, the order amount, and currency. Add a checkout button to your website that calls a server-side endpoint to create a Checkout Session.\n\n`<html>   <head>     <title>Checkout</title>   </head>   <body>     <form action=\"/create-checkout-session\" method=\"POST\">       <button type=\"submit\">Checkout</button>     </form>   </body> </html>`\n\nOn your server, create a Checkout Session and redirect your customer to the [URL](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/object#checkout_session_object-url) returned in the response.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/checkout/sessions \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -H \"Stripe-Account:   {{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}  \" \\  -d \"line_items[0][price_data][currency]\"=usd \\  -d \"line_items[0][price_data][product_data][name]\"=T-shirt \\  -d \"line_items[0][price_data][unit_amount]\"=1000 \\  -d \"line_items[0][quantity]\"=1 \\  -d \"payment_intent_data[application_fee_amount]\"=123 \\  -d mode=payment \\   --data-urlencode success_url=\"[https://example.com/success?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}](https://example.com/success?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID})\"`\n\n*   `line_items` - This attribute represents items that your customer is purchasing and shows up in the Stripe-hosted checkout page.\n*   `payment_intent_data[application_fee_amount]` - This attribute specifies the amount your platform deducts from the transaction as an application fee. After the payment is processed on the connected account, the `application_fee_amount` is transferred to the platform. See [collect fees](#collect-fees) for more information.\n*   `success_url` - Stripe redirects the customer to the success URL after they complete a payment and replaces the `{CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}` string with the Checkout Session ID. Use this to retrieve the Checkout Session and inspect the status to decide what to show your customer. You can also append your own query parameters, which persist through the redirect process. See [customize redirect behavior with a Stripe-hosted page](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/custom-success-page) for more information.\n*   `Stripe-Account` - This header indicates a direct charge for your connected account. The connected account’s [branding](#branding) is used in Checkout, which allows their customers to feel like they’re interacting directly with the connected account instead of your platform.\n\nCharges that you create directly on the connected account are reported only on that account. These charges aren’t shown in your platform’s Dashboard or exports. Direct charges are included in reports and Sigma for connected accounts that your platform controls. You can always retrieve this information using the Stripe API.\n\n[\n\n## Handle post-payment events![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n\n\n](#handle-post-payment-events)\n\nStripe sends a [checkout.session.completed](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-checkout.session.completed) event when the payment completes. [Use a webhook to receive these events](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks/quickstart) and run actions, like sending an order confirmation email to your customer, logging the sale in a database, or starting a shipping workflow.\n\nListen for these events rather than waiting on a callback from the client. On the client, the customer could close the browser window or quit the app before the callback executes. Some payment methods also take 2-14 days for payment confirmation. Setting up your integration to listen for asynchronous events enables you to accept multiple [payment methods](https://stripe.com/payments/payment-methods-guide) with a single integration.\n\nStripe recommends handling all of the following events when collecting payments with Checkout:\n\nThese events all include the [Checkout Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions) object. After the payment succeeds, the underlying [PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents \"Payment Intents API\") [status](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/paymentintents/lifecycle) changes from `processing` to `succeeded` or a failure status.\n\n[](#test-the-integration)\n\n| Card number | Scenario | How to test |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|     | The card payment succeeds and doesn’t require authentication. | Fill out the credit card form using the credit card number with any expiration, CVC, and postal code. |\n|     | The card payment requires [authentication](https://docs.stripe.com/strong-customer-authentication \"Strong Customer Authentication\"). | Fill out the credit card form using the credit card number with any expiration, CVC, and postal code. |\n|     | The card is declined with a decline code like `insufficient_funds`. | Fill out the credit card form using the credit card number with any expiration, CVC, and postal code. |\n|     | The UnionPay card has a variable length of 13-19 digits. | Fill out the credit card form using the credit card number with any expiration, CVC, and postal code. |\n\nSee [Testing](https://docs.stripe.com/testing) for additional information to test your integration.\n\n## Collect fees ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nYour platform can take an application fee with the following limitations:\n\n*   The value of `application_fee_amount` must be positive and less than the amount of the charge. The application fee collected is capped at the amount of the charge.\n*   There are no additional Stripe fees on the application fee itself.\n*   In line with Brazilian regulatory and compliance requirements, platforms based outside of Brazil, with Brazilian connected accounts cannot collect application fees through Stripe.\n*   The currency of `application_fee_amount` depends upon a few [multiple currency](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/currencies) factors.\n\nThe resulting charge’s [balance transaction](https://docs.stripe.com/api#balance_transaction_retrieve) includes a detailed fee breakdown of both the Stripe and application fees. To provide a better reporting experience, an [Application Fee](https://docs.stripe.com/api/application_fees/object) is created after the fee is collected. Use the `amount` property on the application fee object for reporting. You can then access these objects with the [Application Fees](https://docs.stripe.com/api/application_fees/list) endpoint.\n\nEarned application fees are added to your available account balance on the same schedule as funds from regular Stripe charges. Application fees are viewable in the [Collected fees](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/application_fees) section of the Dashboard.\n\n#### Caution\n\nApplication fees for direct charges are created asynchronously by default. If you expand the `application_fee` object in a charge creation request, the application fee is created synchronously as part of that request. Only expand the `application_fee` object if you absolutely have to, because it increases the latency of the request.\n\nTo access the application fee objects for application fees that are created asynchronously, listen for the [application\\_fee.created](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-application_fee.created) webhook event.\n\n### Flow of funds with fees ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nWhen you specify an application fee on a charge, the fee amount is transferred to your platform’s Stripe account. When processing a charge directly on the connected account, the charge amount—less the Stripe fees and application fee—is deposited into the connected account.\n\nFor example, if you make a charge of 10 USD with a 1.23 USD application fee (like in the previous example), 1.23 USD is transferred to your platform account. 8.18 USD (10 USD - 0.59 USD - 1.23 USD) is netted in the connected account (assuming standard US Stripe fees).\n\n![Flow of funds for a charge with an application fee](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/direct_charges_flow.ac943c1635c3c66d1ee5e0020c453744.png)\n\nIf you process payments in multiple currencies, read [how currencies are handled](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/currencies) in Connect.\n\n## Customize branding ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nYour platform and connected accounts can use the [Branding settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/branding) in the Dashboard to customize branding on the payments page. For direct charges, Checkout uses the brand settings of the connected account.\n\nYou can also use the API to [update](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/update#update_account-settings-branding) branding settings:\n\n*   `icon` - Displayed next to the business name in the header of the Checkout page.\n*   `logo` - Used in place of the icon and business name in the header of the Checkout page.\n*   `primary_color` - Used as the background color on the Checkout page.\n*   `secondary_color` - Used as the button color on the Checkout page.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/accounts/`\n\n`{{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}`\n\n `\\  -u \"  sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc  :\" \\  -d \"settings[branding][icon]\"=  {{FILE_ID}}   \\  -d \"settings[branding][logo]\"=  {{FILE_ID}}   \\   --data-urlencode \"settings[branding][primary_color]\"=\"#663399\" \\   --data-urlencode \"settings[branding][secondary_color]\"=\"#4BB543\"`\n\n## Issue refunds ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nJust as platforms can create charges on connected accounts, they can also create refunds of charges on connected accounts. [Create a refund](https://docs.stripe.com/api#create_refund) using your platform’s secret key while [authenticated](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/authentication#stripe-account-header) as the connected account.\n\nApplication fees are not automatically refunded when issuing a refund. Your platform must explicitly refund the application fee or the connected account—the account on which the charge was created—loses that amount. You can refund an application fee by passing a `refund_application_fee` value of **true** in the refund request:\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/refunds \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -H \"Stripe-Account:   {{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}  \" \\  -d charge=  {{CHARGE_ID}}   \\  -d refund_application_fee=true`\n\nBy default, the entire charge is refunded, but you can create a partial refund by setting an `amount` value as a positive integer. If the refund results in the entire charge being refunded, the entire application fee is refunded. Otherwise, a proportional amount of the application fee is refunded. Alternatively, you can provide a `refund_application_fee` value of **false** and [refund the application fee](https://docs.stripe.com/api#create_fee_refund) separately.",

For cross-region support, you must specify the [settlement merchant](#settlement-merchant) to the connected account using the [on\\_behalf\\_of](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-on_behalf_of) parameter on the Payment Intent or other valid [cross-border transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-capabilities#transfers-cross-border) scenarios.\n\nRedirect to a Stripe-hosted payment page using [Stripe Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout). See how this integration [compares to Stripe’s other integration types](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment/web/compare-integrations).\n\n[![Checkout preview](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/b2c79a23390b89a7b589d29387f3e2b2.png)](https://checkout.stripe.dev/)\n\n### Integration effort\n\n### Integration type\n\nRedirect to Stripe-hosted payment page\n\n### UI customization\n\n[Try it out](https://checkout.stripe.dev/)\n\n[](#set-up-stripe)\n\nFirst, [register](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register) for a Stripe account.\n\nUse our official libraries to access the Stripe API from your application:\n\n`# Available as a gem sudo gem install stripe`\n\n`# If you use bundler, you can add this line to your Gemfile gem 'stripe'`\n\n[](#create-checkout-session)\n\nA [Checkout Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions) controls what your customer sees in the payment form such as line items, the order amount and currency, and acceptable payment methods. Add a checkout button to your website that calls a server-side endpoint to create a Checkout Session.\n\n`<html>   <head>     <title>Checkout</title>   </head>   <body>     <form action=\"/create-checkout-session\" method=\"POST\">       <button type=\"submit\">Checkout</button>     </form>   </body> </html>`\n\nOn your server, create a Checkout Session and redirect your customer to the [URL](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/object#checkout_session_object-url) returned in the response.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/checkout/sessions \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d \"line_items[0][price_data][currency]\"=usd \\  -d \"line_items[0][price_data][product_data][name]\"=T-shirt \\  -d \"line_items[0][price_data][unit_amount]\"=1000 \\  -d \"line_items[0][quantity]\"=1 \\  -d \"payment_intent_data[application_fee_amount]\"=123 \\  -d \"payment_intent_data[transfer_data][destination]\"=  {{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}   \\  -d mode=payment \\   --data-urlencode success_url=\"[https://example.com/success?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}](https://example.com/success?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID})\"`\n\n*   `payment_intent_data[transfer_data][destination]` - This parameter indicates that this is a destination charge. A destination charge means the charge is processed on the platform and then the funds are immediately and automatically transferred to the connected account’s pending balance.\n*   `line_items` - This parameter represents the items the customer is purchasing. The items are displayed in the embedded payment form.\n*   `success_url` - Stripe redirects the customer to the success URL after they complete a payment and replaces the `{CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}` string with the Checkout Session ID. Use this to retrieve the Checkout Session and inspect the status to decide what to show your customer. You can also append your own query parameters, which persist through the redirect process. See [customize redirect behavior with a Stripe-hosted page](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/custom-success-page) for more information.\n*   `payment_intent_data[application_fee_amount]` - This parameter specifies the amount your platform plans to take from the transaction. The full charge amount is immediately transferred from the platform to the connected account that’s specified by `transfer_data[destination]` after the charge is captured. The `application_fee_amount` is then transferred back to the platform, and the Stripe fee is deducted from the platform’s amount.\n\nWhen processing destination charges, Checkout uses the brand settings of your platform account. See [customize branding](#branding) for more information.\n\n[\n\n## Handle post-payment events![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n\n\n](#handle-post-payment-events)\n\nStripe sends a [checkout.session.completed](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-checkout.session.completed) event when the payment completes. [Use a webhook to receive these events](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks/quickstart) and run actions, like sending an order confirmation email to your customer, logging the sale in a database, or starting a shipping workflow.\n\nListen for these events rather than waiting on a callback from the client. On the client, the customer could close the browser window or quit the app before the callback executes. Some payment methods also take 2-14 days for payment confirmation. Setting up your integration to listen for asynchronous events enables you to accept multiple [payment methods](https://stripe.com/payments/payment-methods-guide) with a single integration.\n\nStripe recommends handling all of the following events when collecting payments with Checkout:\n\nThese events all include the [Checkout Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions) object. After the payment succeeds, the underlying [PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents \"Payment Intents API\") [status](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/paymentintents/lifecycle) changes from `processing` to `succeeded` or a failure status.\n\n[](#test-the-integration)\n\n| Card number | Scenario | How to test |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|     | The card payment succeeds and doesn’t require authentication. | Fill out the credit card form using the credit card number with any expiration, CVC, and postal code. |\n|     | The card payment requires [authentication](https://docs.stripe.com/strong-customer-authentication \"Strong Customer Authentication\"). | Fill out the credit card form using the credit card number with any expiration, CVC, and postal code. |\n|     | The card is declined with a decline code like `insufficient_funds`. | Fill out the credit card form using the credit card number with any expiration, CVC, and postal code. |\n|     | The UnionPay card has a variable length of 13-19 digits. | Fill out the credit card form using the credit card number with any expiration, CVC, and postal code. |\n\nSee [Testing](https://docs.stripe.com/testing) for additional information to test your integration.\n\n## Collect fees![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYou can collect fees with either an [application\\_fee\\_amount](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-payment_intent_data-application_fee_amount) or [transfer\\_data\\[amount\\]](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-payment_intent_data-transfer_data-amount).\n\nWhen creating charges with an `application_fee_amount`, the full charge amount is immediately transferred from the platform to the `transfer_data[destination]` account after the charge is captured. The `application_fee_amount` (capped at the full amount of the charge) is then transferred back to the platform.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/checkout/sessions \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d \"line_items[0][price_data][currency]\"=usd \\  -d \"line_items[0][price_data][product_data][name]\"=T-shirt \\  -d \"line_items[0][price_data][unit_amount]\"=1000 \\  -d \"line_items[0][quantity]\"=1 \\  -d \"payment_intent_data[application_fee_amount]\"=123 \\  -d \"payment_intent_data[transfer_data][destination]\"=  {{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}   \\  -d mode=payment \\   --data-urlencode success_url=\"[https://example.com/success](https://example.com/success)\"`\n\nAfter the application fee is collected, an [Application Fee](https://docs.stripe.com/api/application_fees/object) object is created. You can view a list of application fees in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/application_fees), with the [application fees](https://docs.stripe.com/api/application_fees/list), or in [Sigma](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-data/access-data-in-dashboard). You can also use the `amount` property on the application fee object for itemized fee reporting.\n\nWhen using an `application_fee_amount`, know that:\n\n*   The `application_fee_amount` is capped at the total transaction amount.\n*   The `application_fee_amount` is always computed in the same currency as the transaction.\n*   The application fee settles in the same currency as the connected account’s settlement currency. For cross-border destination charges, this might [differ from your platform’s settlement currency](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/currencies#application-fees-for-destination-charges-and-converting-balances).\n*   Your platform pays the Stripe fee after the `application_fee_amount` is transferred to your account.\n*   No additional Stripe fees are applied to the amount.\n*   Your platform can use built-in application fee reporting to reconcile [fees collected](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/application_fees).\n*   In Stripe-hosted dashboards or components such as the [Payment details component](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/supported-embedded-components/payment-details), your connected account can view both the total amount and the application fee amount.\n\n### Flow of funds ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nWith the above code, the full charge amount (10.00 USD) is added to the connected account’s pending balance. The `application_fee_amount` (1.23 USD) is subtracted from the charge amount and is transferred to your platform. Stripe fees (0.59 USD) are subtracted from your platform account’s balance. The application fee amount minus the Stripe fees (1.23 USD - 0.59 USD = 0.64 USD) remains in your platform account’s balance.\n\n![Flow of funds for destination charges](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/destination_charge_app_fee.c9ef81298155b38f986df02d0efa9167.png)\n\nThe `application_fee_amount` becomes available on the platform account’s normal transfer schedule, just like funds from regular Stripe charges.\n\n## Customize branding ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nYour platform uses the [branding settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/branding) in the Dashboard to customize branding on the payments page. For destination charges, Checkout uses the branding settings of the platform account. For destination charges with `on_behalf_of`, Checkout uses the branding settings of the connected account.\n\nPlatforms can configure the branding settings of connected accounts using the [Update Account](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/update#update_account-settings-branding) API:\n\n*   `icon` - Displayed next to the business name in the header of the Checkout page.\n*   `logo`\\- Used in place of the icon and business name in the header of the Checkout page.\n*   `primary_color` - Used as the background color on the Checkout page.\n*   `secondary_color` - Used as the button color on the Checkout page.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/accounts/`\n\n`{{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}`\n\n `\\  -u \"  sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc  :\" \\  -d \"settings[branding][icon]\"=  {{FILE_ID}}   \\  -d \"settings[branding][logo]\"=  {{FILE_ID}}   \\   --data-urlencode \"settings[branding][primary_color]\"=\"#663399\" \\   --data-urlencode \"settings[branding][secondary_color]\"=\"#4BB543\"`\n\n## Specify the settlement merchant ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nThe settlement merchant is dependent on the [capabilities](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-capabilities) set on an account and how a charge is created. The settlement merchant determines whose information is used to make the charge. This includes the statement descriptor (either the platform’s or the connected account’s) that’s displayed on the customer’s credit card or bank statement for that charge.\n\nSpecifying the settlement merchant allows you to be more explicit about who to create charges for. For example, some platforms prefer to be the settlement merchant because the end customer interacts directly with their platform (such as on-demand platforms). However, some platforms have connected accounts that interact directly with end customers instead (such as a storefront on an e-commerce platform). In these scenarios, it might make more sense for the connected account to be the settlement merchant.\n\nYou can set the `on_behalf_of` parameter to the ID of a connected account to make that account the settlement merchant for the payment. When using `on_behalf_of`:\n\n*   Charges settle in the connected account’s country and settlement currency.\n*   The fee structure for the connected account’s country is used.\n*   The connected account’s statement descriptor is displayed on the customer’s credit card statement.\n*   If the connected account is in a different country than the platform, the connected account’s address and phone number are displayed on the customer’s credit card statement.\n*   The number of days that a [pending balance](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-balances) is held before being paid out depends on the [delay\\_days](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/create#create_account-settings-payouts-schedule-delay_days) setting on the connected account.\n\nIf `on_behalf_of` is omitted, the platform is the business of record for the payment.\n\n#### Caution\n\nThe `on_behalf_of` parameter is supported only for connected accounts with a payments capability such as [card\\_payments](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-capabilities#card-payments). Accounts under the [recipient service agreement](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/service-agreement-types#recipient) can’t request `card_payments` or other payments capabilities.\n\n## Issue refunds ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nIf you are using the Payment Intents API, refunds should be issued against [the most recent charge that is created](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents/verifying-status#identifying-charges).\n\nCharges created on the platform account can be refunded using the platform account’s secret key. When refunding a charge that has a `transfer_data[destination]`, by default the destination account keeps the funds that were transferred to it, leaving the platform account to cover the negative balance from the refund. To pull back the funds from the connected account to cover the refund, set the `reverse_transfer` parameter to `true` when creating the refund:\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/refunds \\   -u` \n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`: \\   -d charge=\"{CHARGE_ID}\" \\   -d reverse_transfer=true \\`\n\nBy default, the entire charge is refunded, but you can create a partial refund by setting an `amount` value as a positive integer.\n\nIf the refund results in the entire charge being refunded, the entire transfer is reversed. Otherwise, a proportional amount of the transfer is reversed.\n\n### Refund application fees ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nWhen refunding a charge with an application fee, by default the platform account keeps the funds from the application fee. To push the application fee funds back to the connected account, set the [refund\\_application\\_fee](https://docs.stripe.com/api/refunds/create#create_refund-refund_application_fee) parameter to `true` when creating the refund:\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/refunds \\   -u` \n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`: \\   -d charge=\"{CHARGE_ID}\" \\   -d reverse_transfer=true \\   -d refund_application_fee=true \\`\n\nNote that if you refund the application fee for a destination charge, you must also reverse the transfer. If the refund results in the entire charge being refunded, the entire application fee is refunded as well. Otherwise, a proportional amount of the application fee is refunded.\n\nAlternatively, you can provide a `refund_application_fee` value of **false** and refund the application fee separately [through the API](https://docs.stripe.com/api#create_fee_refund).\n\n### Failed refunds![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nIf a refund fails, the amount of the failed refund returns to your platform account’s Stripe balance. Create a [Transfer](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers#create-transfer) to move the funds to the connected account, as needed.",

  "markdown": "# Financial Connections use cases | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## View options for integrating Financial Connections and common use cases.\n\nFinancial Connections allows your users to link their financial accounts to collect ACH payments, facilitate Connect [payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts \"payout\"), and build financial data products. It also enables your users to connect their accounts in fewer steps with [Link](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link), allowing them to save and quickly reuse their bank account details across Stripe merchants. View the following integration paths based on your requirements, and some common use cases for Financial Connections data below.\n\nHow you integrate Financial Connections depends on your desired use cases.\n\nTo process ACH payments or facilitate Connect payouts, use a recommended payments integration in the table above, such as Setup Intents. This makes sure that the collected accounts are compatible with [ACH transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/ach-debit).\n\nThe Financial Connections Sessions API provides more flexibility for use cases that won’t use the collected accounts for ACH payments or Connect payouts. It has configuration options that let your users link additional [account types](https://docs.stripe.com/api/financial_connections/accounts/object#financial_connections_account_object-category) that aren’t compatible with ACH, and you can collect multiple accounts in a single session.\n\nRegardless of which API you choose to integrate with, you can request access to additional data on your users’ financial accounts. You can then use this data to optimize your integration or create more complex products. The following sections provide more context on the above use cases, including recommendations on which data to access.\n\n[](#ach-direct-debit)\n\nIn accordance with [Nacha regulations](https://support.stripe.com/questions/nacha-bank-account-validation-rule), you must verify a user’s account to accept an ACH Direct Debit payment or transfer. With Financial Connections, your customer authenticates their bank account and provides permission to share the details you need to charge their account, such as a tokenized account and routing number.\n\nCollecting bank account details from a customer with Financial Connections can help you:\n\n*   Improve payment reliability by verifying that a user’s bank account is open and able to accept ACH direct debits.\n*   Increase checkout conversion by eliminating the need for your customers to leave your website or application to locate their account and routing numbers.\n*   Save development time by eliminating the need for you to build bank account form validation when your customer enters account details.\n\nTo verify a bank account to accept an ACH Direct Debit payment with Financial Connections, use Stripe’s Payment Intent or Setup Intent APIs. Alternatively, you can use a hosted Stripe payments integration such as [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout) or the [Payment Element](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-element).\n\nLearn how to [collect a bank account to accept an ACH Direct Debit payment](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/ach-direct-debit-payments).\n\nOptionally, you can request permission from your customers to retrieve additional data on their [Financial Connections account](https://docs.stripe.com/api/financial_connections/accounts/object). We recommend that you access [balances](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/balances) data to perform balance checks prior to processing the payment.\n\nManual account entry and microdeposit verification are available as a fallback method for this use case. However, accounts that you add through microdeposits won’t have access to additional account data.\n\n[](#custom-connect-payouts)\n\nUse Financial Connections with Connect to verify bank accounts for Custom connected accounts, thereby facilitating payouts. This allows your connected account to authenticate its own bank account and provide permission to share details you need for payouts, like tokenized account and routing numbers.\n\nCollecting account details from your connected account with Financial Connections can help you:\n\n*   Increase onboarding conversion by eliminating the need for your connected account to leave your website or application to locate their account and routing numbers.\n*   Reduce first payout failure rates by eliminating errors that result from manual entry of account and routing numbers.\n*   Make sure you don’t need to store sensitive data such as account and routing numbers on your server.\n*   Save development time by eliminating the need for you to build bank account form validation when your connected account enters their bank account details.\n\nOptionally, you can request permission from your connected account to retrieve additional data on their Financial Connections account. Consider accessing [ownership](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/ownership) details to optimize your onboarding process. Retrieving ownership data on an account can help you mitigate fraud by verifying an account’s ownership details, such as the name and address of the account holder.\n\nLearn how to [collect a bank account to initiate payouts to a US Custom Connect account](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/connect-payouts).\n\nManual account entry and microdeposit verification are available as a fallback method for this use case (for example, if your connected account can’t find their institution or otherwise authenticate). However, accounts that you add through microdeposits won’t have access to additional account data.\n\n[](#building-other-products)\n\nUse Financial Connections to access external bank account data that you can use to build financial products.\n\nAfter your user has consented to share data from their financial accounts, you can retrieve data for various use cases, such as:\n\n*   Help your user track expenses, handle bills, manage their finances and take control of their financial well-being with [transactions](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/transactions) data.\n*   Speed up underwriting and improve access to credit and other financial services with transactions and balances data.\n\nLearn how to [collect an account to access data](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/other-data-powered-products) using Financial Connections’ Sessions API.\n\nManual account entry and microdeposit verification aren’t available in the authentication flow for this use case because the primary goal of collecting an account is data accessibility.\n\nYou can [convert most previously linked Financial Connections accounts to Payment Methods](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/other-data-powered-products?platform=web#accept-ach-direct-debit). However, if your integration uses the Sessions API, the linked account might not be compatible with ACH.",

For connected accounts that don’t use the Dashboard (which includes Express and Custom connected accounts), the platform configures receipt settings through [settings.branding](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/update#update_account-settings-branding).\n\n## Automatically send paid invoices ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nIn addition to ordinary receipts, Payment Links can generate paid invoices as proof of payment. Invoices have more information than receipts. For subscriptions, Stripe generates invoices automatically, but for one-time payments, you need to enable them.\n\nTo generate invoices, toggle **Successful payments** on in your [Customer emails settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/emails). Then, when [creating a Payment Link](https://dashboard.stripe.com/payment-links/create), select **Create an invoice PDF** in the **After payment** tab. You can configure your invoice, including adding a memo, footer, and your tax ID in your [invoice template settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/invoice).\n\nAfter the payment completes, Stripe sends an invoice summary with links to download the invoice PDF and invoice receipt to the email address your customer provides during checkout. You can also view the invoice in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/invoices) or access it programmatically by listening to the [`invoice.paid`](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-invoice.paid) webhook event.\n\n#### Caution\n\nInvoices for delayed notification payment methods such as [Bacs Direct Debit](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/bacs-debit/accept-a-payment), [Bank transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/bank-transfers/accept-a-payment), [Boleto](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/boleto/accept-a-payment), [Canadian pre-authorized debits](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/acss-debit/accept-a-payment), [Konbini](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/konbini/accept-a-payment), [OXXO](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/oxxo/accept-a-payment), [Pay by Bank](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/pay-by-bank/accept-a-payment), [SEPA Direct Debit](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/sepa-debit/accept-a-payment), [SOFORT](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/sofort/accept-a-payment), or [ACH Direct Debit](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/ach-debit/accept-a-payment) might take longer to send because we send the invoice after successful payment, not upon checkout session completion.\n\n![Screenshot of the invoice PDF that customers can download from the invoice summary email](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/invoice.9e44668032383601eeec362f38293b7a.png)\n\nThe downloadable invoice PDF\n\n![Screenshot of the invoice receipt that customers can download from the invoice summary email](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/invoice_receipt.4f120ee7363f8e7728fa553a8a24aae3.png)\n\nThe downloadable invoice receipt\n\n![Screenshot of the invoice summary email Stripe sends](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/email.560c2666905531b907f7fcd4f1a0a6dd.png)\n\nThe customer email with links to the invoice PDF and receipt",

  "markdown": "# Financial Connections fundamentals | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Learn how Financial Connections works.\n\nThe Stripe Financial Connections product has two main components: end user bank account collection through the authentication flow, and data retrieval on the collected accounts. There are a [number of ways](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/use-cases) to integrate Financial Connections. In the following example, we assume you’re using a [Financial Connections Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/financial_connections/sessions). However, the overall concepts and flow diagrams function similarly with payments integrations such as Setup or Payment Intents.\n\nTo initialize and complete the Financial Connections authentication flow:\n\n1.  Your user initiates the bank account linking process on your client.\n2.  Create a Financial Connections Session on your server to drive the authentication flow.\n3.  Return the session’s `client_secret` to your client.\n4.  Initiate the authentication flow using [collectFinancialConnectionsAccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/js/financial_connections/collect_financial_connections_accounts).\n5.  Your user completes the flow, which attaches [accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/api/financial_connections/accounts) to the session.\n\nAfter you have your user’s authenticated accounts, you can initiate data refreshes from your server. When the refreshes are complete, you can retrieve the account data.\n\n[](#authentication-flow)\n\nThe authentication flow is the client-side UI that allows your user to consent to data sharing and link their financial accounts to you and Stripe.\n\nEmbed the UI in your client-side user flow. It works across all major browsers and platforms, including web, iOS, Android, and mobile web views.\n\n![Authentication Flow](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/canonical-flow-v3.e0b5244b9d16ed2e03e6ed656e5ab1df.png)\n\nYour user follows these steps during the authentication flow:\n\n| Step | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Give consent** | Users consent to share requested data. |\n| **Select institution** | Users select their bank either from frequently chosen banks or by searching over more than 5,000 other supported banks. |\n| **Log into bank** | Users authenticate access to their accounts by logging into their bank. |\n| **Select account(s)** | Users select which specific account(s) to link. |\n| **Success** | Users see a success screen after authentication completes successfully. |\n\nFor payments integrations such as Setup Intents, you can configure the authentication flow to use microdeposits as a fallback using the [verification\\_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_intents/create#create_setup_intent-payment_method_options-us_bank_account-verification_method) parameter.\n\n### Return user optimization![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nFinancial Connections enables your users to connect their accounts in fewer steps with [Link](https://support.stripe.com/questions/link-for-financial-connections-support-for-businesses), allowing them to save and quickly reuse their bank account details across Stripe merchants.\n\n![Authentication Flow](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/return-user-flow-v3.5a17b62098a2cfb95d42bfe37f641d1e.png)\n\nFor return users, launch the Financial Connections authentication flow with a [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers \"Customers\") that has an email address. See our [use case guide](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/use-cases) for examples of how to do this for your specific use case.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/customers \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d email={{CUSTOMER_EMAIL}}`\n\n[](#how-stripe-links-financial-accounts)\n\nDuring the authentication flow, your user logs into their bank through either an OAuth (bank-hosted) or non-OAuth flow to authenticate access to their accounts. Stripe typically defaults the authentication flow to OAuth if it’s available at the financial institution. Your integration doesn’t need to treat OAuth accounts differently than non-OAuth accounts.\n\nOAuth is a standardized protocol that allows users to grant applications (for example, Stripe) access to their information within other applications (for example, bank apps). This protocol eliminates the need for users to share their login credentials.\n\nHere’s how OAuth and Financial Connections function together:\n\n*   When your user selects their bank in the Financial Connections authentication flow, they’re sent to their bank’s website or mobile app.\n*   Your user logs into their bank and grants the bank permission to share account data (such as balances or transactions) with Stripe.\n*   The bank redirects your user back to the authentication flow, passing a token that allows Stripe access to approved bank account information.\n*   Your user never shares their login credentials with Stripe.\n\nIn non-OAuth flows, end users provide credentials directly to Stripe or one of our [trusted partners](https://support.stripe.com/questions/what-is-the-relationship-between-stripe-and-stripe-s-service-providers).\n\n[](#financial-connections-account)\n\nSuccessful completion of the authentication flow creates one [Financial Connections Account](https://docs.stripe.com/api/financial_connections/accounts/object) for each account authorized by your user. The Financial Connections Account is the API object you use to access additional account data, such as balances and transactions. They represent external financial accounts such as checking, savings, loan, or credit card accounts. See the [account\\_subcategory](https://docs.stripe.com/api/financial_connections/accounts/object#financial_connections_account_object-subcategory) field on the account for a list of all account types we support. Only cash-based accounts, such as checking and savings accounts, allow ACH (Automated Clearing House) transfers.\n\n[](#data-permissions)\n\nAfter collecting an account, you immediately receive access to the following information:\n\n*   Last four digits of the account number\n*   Account category such as checking or savings\n*   Account nickname, if available\n\nTo access additional account data such as balances or transactions, you must request access with data permissions. You configure data permissions on server-side objects such as the Financial Connections Session using the [permissions](https://docs.stripe.com/api/financial_connections/sessions/create#financial_connections_create_session-permissions) parameter.\n\n| Data Available | Permissions | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Account details | `payment_method` | Tokenized account and routing number (required for money movement) |\n| Account owners | `ownership` | Account owner names and mailing addresses |\n| Balances | `balances` | Current and available balances |\n| Transactions | `transactions` | Pending and posted transactions |\n\nConsider the data required to fulfill your use case and request permission to access only the data you need. Requesting permissions that go well beyond your application’s scope may erode your users’ trust in how you use their data. For example, if you’re building a personal financial management application or a lending product, you might request `transactions` data. If you’re mitigating fraud such as account takeovers, you might want to request `ownership` details.\n\nDuring the authentication flow, your users can see the data types that you’ve requested access to. They must provide their consent to share this data. To expand the data types you have access to, your user needs to complete the authentication flow again with the new data permissions.\n\nConsult the [balances integration](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/balances) guide for an example of how to access financial account data, or learn more about [use cases](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/use-cases) for the different data types.",

You can use Financial Connections to access user-permissioned financial data such as tokenized account and routing numbers, account balances, account owner information, and historical transactions.\n\nSome common examples of how you can use Financial Connections to improve product experiences for your users include:\n\n*   Mitigate fraud when onboarding a customer or business by verifying the [ownership](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/ownership) information of an account, such as the name and address of the bank account holder.\n*   Help your users track expenses, handle bills, manage their finances and take control of their financial well-being with [transactions](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/transactions) data.\n*   Speed up underwriting and improve access to credit and other financial services with transactions and balances data.\n*   Enable your users to connect their accounts in fewer steps with Link, allowing them to save and quickly reuse their bank account details across Stripe merchants.\n    \n\n[](#setup-stripe)\n\n[Register](https://dashboard.stripe.com/financial-connections/application) for Financial Connections after we approve your account for live-mode access.\n\nUse our official libraries for access to the Stripe API from your application:\n\n`# Available as a gem sudo gem install stripe`\n\n`# If you use bundler, you can add this line to your Gemfile gem 'stripe'`\n\n[](#create-a-customer)\n\nCreate a [Customer object](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object) when users create an account with your business. By providing an email address, Financial Connections can optimize the [authentication flow](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/fundamentals#authentication-flow) by dynamically showing a streamlined user interface, for returning [Link](https://support.stripe.com/questions/link-for-financial-connections-support-for-businesses) users.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/customers \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d email={{CUSTOMER_EMAIL}} \\   -d name={{CUSTOMER_NAME}}`\n\n[](#create-a-session)\n\nBefore you can retrieve data from a user’s bank account with Financial Connections, your user must authenticate their account with the [authentication flow](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/fundamentals#authentication-flow).\n\nYour user begins the authentication flow when they want to connect their account to your site or application. Insert a button or link on your site or in your application, which allows a user to link their account—for example, your button might say “Link your bank account”.\n\nCreate a Financial Connections Session by posting to `/v1/financial_connections/sessions`:\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/financial_connections/sessions \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d \"account_holder[type]\"=customer \\  -d \"account_holder[customer]\"=  {{CUSTOMER_ID}}   \\  -d \"permissions[]\"=balances \\  -d \"permissions[]\"=ownership \\  -d \"permissions[]\"=payment_method \\  -d \"permissions[]\"=transactions`\n\n1.  Set `account_holder[customer]` to the Customer `id`.\n2.  Set the data `permissions` parameter to include the data required to fulfill your use case.\n3.  _(Optional)_ set the `prefetch` parameter for retrieving the data on account creation.\n\nThe [permissions](https://docs.stripe.com/api/financial_connections/sessions/create#financial_connections_create_session-permissions) parameter controls which account data you can access. You must request at least one permission. When completing the authentication flow, your user can see the data you’ve requested access to, and provide their consent to share it.\n\nConsider the data required to fulfill your use case and request permission to access only the data you need. Requesting permissions that go well beyond your application’s scope might erode your users’ trust in how you use their data. For example, if you’re building a personal financial management application or a lending product, you might request `transactions` data. If you’re mitigating fraud such as account takeovers, you might want to request `ownership` details.\n\nAfter your user authenticates their account, you can expand data permissions only by creating a new Financial Connections Session and specifying a new value for the `permissions` parameter. Your user must complete the authentication flow again, where they’ll see the additional data you’ve requested permission to access, and provide consent to share their data.\n\nThe optional [prefetch parameter](https://docs.stripe.com/api/financial_connections/sessions/create#financial_connections_create_session-prefetch) controls which data you retrieve immediately after the user connects their account. Use this option if you know you always want a certain type of data. It removes the need to make an extra API call to initiate a [data refresh](https://docs.stripe.com/api/financial_connections/accounts/refresh).\n\nTo preserve the option to [accept ACH Direct Debit payments](#accept-ach-direct-debit), request the `payment_method` permission.\n\n[](#collect-an-account)\n\nUse the returned `client_secret` with Stripe.js to allow your user to connect their accounts. A `client_secret` allows client-side Stripe SDKs to make changes to the Financial Connections Session. Don’t store it, log it, embed it in URLs, or expose it to anyone other than your end user. Make sure that you have [TLS](https://docs.stripe.com/security/guide#tls) enabled on any page that includes the client secret.\n\nUse [collectFinancialConnectionsAccounts](https://docs.stripe.com/js/financial_connections/collect_financial_connections_accounts) to collect an account.\n\n`const stripe = new Stripe(`\n\n`'pk_test_TYooMQauvdEDq54NiTphI7jx'`\n\n`) const financialConnectionsSessionResult = await stripe.collectFinancialConnectionsAccounts({   clientSecret: \"{{SESSION_CLIENT_SECRET}}\", });`\n\nThis method loads the [authentication flow](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/fundamentals#authentication-flow), the client-side Stripe.js UI that helps your users link their financial accounts to you and Stripe.\n\nThe return value of `stripe.collectFinancialConnectionsAccounts` is a Promise. When the user completes the authentication flow, the Promise resolves with an object that contains the list of connected accounts:\n\n`{   \"financialConnectionsSession\": {     \"id\": \"fcsess_123\",     \"accounts\": [       {         \"id\": \"fca_456\",         \"object\": \"financial_connections.account\",         \"category\": \"Checking\",         \"display_name\": \"Premium Checking\",         \"institution_name\": \"Test Bank\",         \"last4\": \"4242\"       }     ]   } }`\n\nIf the user connects no accounts, or exits the authentication flow early, the response contains an empty `accounts` array.\n\nSuccessful completion of the authentication flow also sends one `financial_connections.account.created` webhook per account connected.\n\n[](#retrieve-additional-data)\n\nAfter your user has successfully completed the authentication flow, access or refresh the account data you’ve specified in the `permissions` parameter of the Financial Connections Session.\n\nTo protect the privacy of your user’s data, account data accessible to you is limited to the data you’ve specified in the `permissions` parameter.\n\nFollow the guides for [balances](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/balances), [ownership](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/ownership) and [transactions](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/transactions) to start retrieving account data.",

Balance data is useful for a variety of applications, including reducing the risk of insufficient funds failures for ACH, underwriting, or building financial management tools.\n\n## Before you begin![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYou must have a completed Financial Connections registration to access balances in live mode.

You initiate a balance refresh and wait for it to complete, then retrieve the results. You can initiate balance refreshes with the `prefetch` API parameter or the [Refresh API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/financial_connections/accounts/refresh).\n\n### Prefetch balance data![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nSpecify whether you want to prefetch account balances _before_ account collection. This initiates the refresh process as soon as your user connects their account in the [authentication flow](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/fundamentals#authentication-flow). Set `prefetch` when you require balance data for every linked account, to make sure you receive it with minimal delay. An example of this is if you plan to perform balance checks prior to initiating an ACH payment. The `prefetch` parameter is available on all APIs that support Financial Connections.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/payment_intents \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d amount=20000 \\  -d currency=usd \\  -d \"payment_method_types[]\"=us_bank_account \\  -d \"payment_method_options[us_bank_account][financial_connections][prefetch][]\"=balances \\  -d \"payment_method_options[us_bank_account][financial_connections][permissions][]\"=payment_method \\  -d \"payment_method_options[us_bank_account][financial_connections][permissions][]\"=balances`\n\n### Initiate an on-demand refresh![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nUse the [Refresh API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/financial_connections/accounts/refresh) to initiate on-demand balance refreshes _after_ account collection, and fetch balance information for a specific account at your convenience, allowing you to defer the decision until a later time.\n\nUse the Financial Connections account ID to initiate a refresh. If you’re integrating through a payments flow, find the account ID [on the associated Payment Method](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/ach-direct-debit-payments#finding-the-financial-connections-account-id).

This field remains `null` until you request the `balances` permission and initiate a refresh. After you start a balance refresh, the state changes to `pending`, and after completion, it moves to either `succeeded` or `failed`. We send the [financial\\_connections.account.refreshed\\_balance](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-financial_connections.account.refreshed_balance) event when the balance refresh completes. To determine the success of the refresh, check the `balance_refresh.status` field while handling the webhook.\n\nAfter a balance refresh completes, Stripe sets the availability of future refreshes through the [balance\\_refresh.next\\_refresh\\_available\\_at](https://docs.stripe.com/api/financial_connections/accounts/object#financial_connections_account_object-balance_refresh-next_refresh_available_at) field.

This amount ignores events that have yet to post to an account such as incoming transfers, outgoing transfers, and other holds. A positive amount indicates money owed to the account holder. A negative amount indicates money owed by the account holder. |\n| `available` | The balance object is polymorphic, with types `cash` and `credit`. If the balance has `type: \"cash\"`, you’ll see a `cash` sub-object with the `available` property, which is the amount of funds available for use, such as any to be transferred or paid out, after considering incoming and outgoing holds. |\n| `used` | The balance object is polymorphic, with types `cash` and `credit`. If the balance has `type: \"credit\"`, you’ll see a `credit` sub-object with the `used` property, which is the amount of funds that have been consumed after taking outgoing holds into account. For credit balances, `current` and `used` amounts use the same sign convention used for cash balances: a positive amount means funds owed _to_ the account holder, a negative amount means funds owed _by_ the account holder. In most cases a credit balance has negative amounts. |\n\nThe availability of balances varies by underlying financial institution. We return all balance data that we have access to. In rare cases, most often when dealing with smaller financial institutions, Stripe can’t retrieve balance data from a financial institution or partner of any kind, in which case the `balance` object is `null`. The balance object is also `null` if the account has been disconnected. In some instances only a `current` balance is returned. See our list of [supported institutions](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/supported-institutions) for data coverage.\n\nFor the `cash` balance type, use the `available` sub-object to confirm sufficient funds exist prior to initiating an ACH Direct Debit payment. If an `available` balance is null, you might want to use the `current` balance to confirm sufficient funds prior to initiating an ACH Direct Debit, but be mindful that this amount ignores events that have yet to post to an account such as incoming transfers, outgoing transfers, and other holds.\n\nThe `as_of` field on a balance is the date and time that the financial institution calculated this balance. This isn’t the same as the date and time of balance data retrieval. For example, certain institutions only update balance data once per day, while others update more frequently.",

Remember to switch to your live secret key in production. // See your keys here: [https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys) const stripe = require('stripe')(`\n\n`'sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc'`\n\n`);  // In the route handler for /create-verification-session: // Authenticate your user.  // Create the session. const verificationSession = await stripe.identity.verificationSessions.create({   type: 'document',   metadata: {     user_id: '{{USER_ID}}',   }, });  // Return only the client secret to the frontend. const clientSecret = verificationSession.client_secret;`\n\n#### Caution\n\nThe client secret lets your frontend collect sensitive verification information. It’s single-use and expires after 24 hours. Don’t store it, log it, embed it in a URL, or expose it to anyone other than the user. Make sure that you have TLS enabled on any page that includes the client secret. Send only the client secret to your frontend to avoid exposing verification configuration or results.\n\nTest your endpoint by starting your web server (for example, `localhost:4242`) and sending a POST request with curl to create a VerificationSession:\n\n`curl -X POST -is \"http://localhost:4242/create-verification-session\" -d \"\"`\n\nThe response in your terminal looks like this:\n\n`HTTP/1.1 200 OK Content-Type: application/json  { client_secret: \"vs_QdfQQ6xfGNJR7ogV6...\"  }`\n\n### Add an event handler to the verify button![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nNow that you have a button and an endpoint to create a VerificationSession, modify the button to show the document upload modal when clicked. Add a call to [`verifyIdentity`](https://docs.stripe.com/js/identity/modal) using the client secret:\n\n`<html>   <head>     <title>Verify your identity</title>     <script src=\"[https://js.stripe.com/v3/](https://js.stripe.com/v3/)\"></script>   </head>   <body>     <button id=\"verify-button\">Verify</button>      <script type=\"text/javascript\">       // Set your publishable key: remember to change this to your live publishable key in production       // See your keys here: [https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys)       var stripe = Stripe(`\n\n`'pk_test_TYooMQauvdEDq54NiTphI7jx'`\n\n``);        var verifyButton = document.getElementById('verify-button');        verifyButton.addEventListener('click', function() {         // Get the VerificationSession client secret using the server-side         // endpoint you created in step 3.         fetch('/create-verification-session', {           method: 'POST',         })         .then(function(response) {           return response.json();         })         .then(function(session) {           // Show the verification modal.           return stripe.verifyIdentity(session.client_secret);         })         .then(function(result) {           // If `verifyIdentity` fails, you should display the localized           // error message to your user using `error.message`.           if (result.error) {             alert(result.error.message);           }         })         .catch(function(error) {           console.error('Error:', error);         });       });     </script>   </body> </html>``\n\n### Event error codes![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n| Error code | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `consent_declined` | The user declined verification by Stripe. Check with your legal counsel to see if you have an obligation to offer an alternative, non-biometric means to verify, such as through a manual review. |\n| `device_unsupported` | The verification requires a camera and the user is on a device without one. |\n| `under_supported_age` | Stripe doesn’t verify users under the age of majority. |\n| `phone_otp_declined` | The user is unable to verify the provided phone number. |\n| `email_verification_declined` | The user is unable to verify the provided email address. |\n\n### Test the upload modal![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nTest that the verify button shows a document upload modal:\n\n*   Click the verify button, which opens the Stripe document upload modal.\n*   Ensure no error messages are shown.\n\nIf your integration isn’t working:\n\n1.  Open the Network tab in your browser’s developer tools.\n2.  Click the verify button to see if it makes an XHR request to your server-side endpoint (`POST /create-verification-session`).\n3.  Verify that the request returns a 200 status.\n4.  Use `console.log(session)` inside your button click listener to confirm that it returns the correct data.\n\n[](#show-confirmation-page)\n\nTo provide a user-friendly experience, show a confirmation page after users successfully submit their identity document. Host the page on your site to let the user know that the verification is processing.\n\nCreate a minimal confirmation page:\n\n`<html>   <head><title>Your document was submitted</title></head>   <body>     <h1>Thanks for submitting your identity document.</h1>     <p>       We are processing your verification.     </p>   </body> </html>`\n\nNext, update the button handler to redirect to this page:\n\n`<html>   <head>     <title>Verify your identity</title>     <script src=\"[https://js.stripe.com/v3/](https://js.stripe.com/v3/)\"></script>   </head>   <body>     <button id=\"verify-button\">Verify</button>      <script type=\"text/javascript\">       // Set your publishable key: remember to change this to your live publishable key in production       // See your keys here: [https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys)       var stripe = Stripe(`\n\n`'pk_test_TYooMQauvdEDq54NiTphI7jx'`\n\n``)        var verifyButton = document.getElementById('verify-button');        verifyButton.addEventListener('click', function() {         // Get the VerificationSession client secret using the server-side         // endpoint you created in step 3.         fetch('/create-verification-session', {           method: 'POST',         })         .then(function(response) {           return response.json();         })         .then(function(session) {           // Show the verification modal.           return stripe.verifyIdentity(session.client_secret);         })         .then(function(result) {           // If `verifyIdentity` fails, you should display the error message           // using `error.message`.           if (result.error) {             alert(result.error.message);           } else {             window.location.href = 'submitted.html';           }         })         .catch(function(error) {           console.error('Error:', error);         });       });     </script>   </body> </html>``\n\n### Test the confirmation page![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nTest that your confirmation page works:\n\n*   Click your verify button.\n*   Submit the session by selecting a predefined test case.\n*   Confirm that the new confirmation page is shown.\n*   Test the entire flow for failure cases (such as declining consent or refusing camera permissions) and ensure your app handles them without any issues.\n\nNext, find the verification in the Stripe Dashboard. Verification sessions appear in the Dashboard’s [list of VerificationSessions](https://dashboard.stripe.com/identity). Click a session to go to the Session Detail page. The summary section contains verification results, which you can use in your app.\n\n[\n\n## Handle verification events![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n\n\n](#handle-verification-events)\n\n[Document checks](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verification-checks#document-availability) are typically completed as soon as the user redirects back to your site and you can retrieve the result from the API immediately. In some rare cases, the document verification isn’t ready yet and must continue asynchronously. In these cases, you’re notified through webhooks when the verification result is ready. After the processing completes, the VerificationSession [status changes](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/how-sessions-work) from `processing` to `verified`.\n\nStripe sends the following events when the session status changes:\n\nUse a [webhook handler](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/handle-verification-outcomes) to receive these events and automate actions like sending a confirmation email, updating the verification results in your database, or completing an onboarding step. You can also view [verification events in the Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/events?type=identity.%2A).\n\n## Receive events and run business actions![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n### With code![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nBuild a webhook handler to listen for events and build custom asynchronous verification flows.

  "markdown": "# Access transactions for a Financial Connections account\n\n## Learn how to access an account's transactions with your user's permission.\n\nThe Financial Connections API allows you to retrieve transactions on a [Financial Connections Account](https://docs.stripe.com/api/financial_connections/accounts/object). Use transaction data to build a variety of products and solutions, such as:\n\n*   Expedite the underwriting process and improve access to credit and other financial services for your users.\n*   Mitigate fraud and reduce risk during user onboarding by evaluating a user’s transaction history, and understanding cash inflows and outflows from their financial accounts.\n*   Help your users track expenses, handle bills, and manage their finances.\n\n## Before you begin![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYou must have a completed Financial Connections registration to access transactions in live mode. Check your [Dashboard settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/financial-connections) to check the state of your registration or begin the registration process. Test mode Financial Connections data is always available.\n\n[](#customer)\n\nWe recommend that you create a [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers \"Customers\") with an email address to represent your user, that you then attach to your payment. Attaching a Customer object allows you to [list previously linked accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/api/financial_connections/accounts/list) later. By providing an email address on the Customer object, Financial Connections can improve the authentication flow by streamlining sign-in or sign-up for your user, depending on whether they’re a returning [Link](https://support.stripe.com/questions/link-for-financial-connections-support-for-businesses) user.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/customers \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d email={{CUSTOMER_EMAIL}}`\n\n[](#request-access-to-transactions)\n\nYou must collect an account before you can access its transaction data. To learn more about how to collect Financial Connections Accounts consult the integration guide most relevant to your use case: [accept payments](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/ach-direct-debit-payments), [facilitate Connect payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/connect-payouts), or [build other-data powered products](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/other-data-powered-products).\n\nWhen collecting an account, you specify the data you need access to with the [permissions](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/fundamentals#data-permissions) parameter. The set of requested data permissions are viewable by the user in the [authentication flow](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/fundamentals#authentication-flow). Financial Connections Accounts are collectible through various integration paths, and how you specify the parameter varies slightly by API.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/payment_intents \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d amount=20000 \\  -d currency=usd \\  -d customer=  {{CUSTOMER_ID}}   \\  -d \"payment_method_types[]\"=us_bank_account \\  -d \"payment_method_options[us_bank_account][financial_connections][permissions][]\"=transactions \\  -d \"payment_method_options[us_bank_account][financial_connections][permissions][]\"=payment_method`\n\nWhen using dynamic payment methods for certain payments APIs, you can also configure requested permissions in the Dashboard. Learn how to [access additional account data on Financial Connections accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/ach-direct-debit-payments?dashboard-or-api=dashboard#access).\n\n[](#subscribe-to-transactions)\n\nWhen you subscribe to an account’s transaction data, Stripe automatically retrieves new transactions in the background every day and notifies you when they’re available. Subscribing to daily updates is the easiest way to keep the account’s transaction data up to date.\n\nTo get the Financial Connections Account ID you want to subscribe to transactions for, consult the documentation for our [payments integrations](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/ach-direct-debit-payments#finding-the-financial-connections-account-id) or check the guide for [Financial Connections Sessions](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/other-data-powered-products?platform=web#collect-an-account).\n\nSubscribe to transaction data by calling the [subscribe API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/financial_connections/accounts/subscribe):\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/financial_connections/accounts/`\n\n`{{ACCOUNT_ID}}`\n\n`/subscribe \\  -u \"  sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc  :\" \\  -d \"features[]\"=transactions`\n\n#### Note\n\nSubscriptions aren’t allowed on inactive accounts.\n\nIn addition to activating a subscription to future transaction data, this API call automatically initiates a transaction refresh:\n\n`{   \"id\": \"fca_1LDYuMGxLVUXRs6HW0lrat9T\",   \"object\": \"financial_connections.account\",   \"display_name\": \"Savings\",   \"institution_name\": \"Test Bank\",   \"status\": \"active\",   \"permissions\": [\"transactions\"],   \"subscriptions\": [\"transactions\"],   \"transaction_refresh\": {     \"id\": \"fctxnref_1aaaxqEitUZY8Svm4QdcWZKt\",     \"last_attempted_at\": 1706742786,     \"next_refresh_available_at\": null,     \"status\": \"pending\"   }   // ... }`\n\nAs long as you remain subscribed to transaction data, Stripe initiates a new refresh every day.\n\n### Wait for the refresh to complete ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nAll Financial Connections data refreshes are asynchronous. After you initiate a transaction refresh, you must wait for it to complete, then retrieve the resulting transactions.\n\nThe [transaction\\_refresh](https://docs.stripe.com/api/financial_connections/accounts/object#financial_connections_account_object-transaction_refresh) field on a Financial Connections account represents the transaction refresh state. This field remains `null` until you request the `transactions` permission and initiate a refresh. After you start a transaction refresh, the state changes to `pending`, and after completion, it moves to either `succeeded` or `failed`. We send the [financial\\_connections.account.refreshed\\_transactions](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-financial_connections.account.refreshed_transactions) event when the transaction refresh completes. To determine the success of the refresh, check the `transaction_refresh.status` field while handling the webhook.\n\n[](#retrieve-transactions)\n\nAfter Stripe successfully refreshes transactions on the account, you can retrieve them using the [transactions list API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/financial_connections/transactions/list):\n\n`curl -G https://api.stripe.com/v1/financial_connections/transactions \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d account=  {{ACCOUNT_ID}}    `\n\nStripe returns a [paginated](https://docs.stripe.com/api/pagination) list of up to the last 180 days of transaction history on an account, depending on the account’s financial institution.\n\n`{   \"object\": \"list\",   \"data\": [     {       \"id\": \"fctxn_1LXp9RGxLVUXRs6HtTSVfxse\",       \"object\": \"financial_connections.transaction\",       \"account\": \"fca_1LDYuMGxLVUXRs6HW0lrat9T\",       \"amount\": -1000,       \"currency\": \"usd\",       \"description\": \"Rocket Rides\",       \"livemode\": true,       \"status\": \"posted\",       \"status_transitions\": {         \"posted_at\": 1651784999,         \"void_at\": null       },       \"transacted_at\": 1651784999,       \"transaction_refresh\": \"fctxnref_1LXp8WGxLVUXRs6Hkc5PNUXf\",       \"updated\": 1651784999     },     {...},     {...}   ],   \"has_more\": false,   \"url\": \"/v1/financial_connections/transactions\" }`\n\nThe [status](https://docs.stripe.com/api/financial_connections/transactions/object#financial_connections_transaction_object-status) of a transaction is one of `pending`, `posted`, or `void`. Information included in the [description](https://docs.stripe.com/api/financial_connections/transactions/object#financial_connections_transaction_object-description) field varies, but can include metadata such as the business name.\n\n### Retrieving transactions since last refresh![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYou might wish to retrieve only new transaction data since your last data pull. For example, some users save previously retrieved transaction data to their database, and subsequently merge new or updated data as it becomes available.\n\nTo retrieve only new or updated transaction data since your last refresh, pass the `transaction_refresh` identifier provided by your last observed [financial\\_connections.account.refreshed\\_transactions](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-financial_connections.account.refreshed_transactions) webhook event object to the list API:\n\n`curl -G https://api.stripe.com/v1/financial_connections/transactions \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d account=  {{ACCOUNT_ID}}   \\  -d \"transaction_refresh[after]\"=fctxnref_1LXp8WGxLVUXRs6Hkc5PNUXf`\n\nThe following is an example [webhook](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks#webhook-endpoint-def) integration that only retrieves and records new or updated transaction data:\n\n``import stripe from flask import Flask app = Flask(__name__)  @app.route('/stripe_webhooks', methods=['POST']) def webhook():     event = None     try:         event = stripe.Event.construct_from(json.loads(request.data), stripe.api_key)     except ValueError as e:         # Invalid payload         raise e      if event.type == \"financial_connections.account.refreshed_transactions\":         account = event.data.object         sync_transactions(account[\"id\"], account[\"transaction_refresh\"][\"id\"])      return jsonify(success=True)  def sync_transactions(account_id, current_refresh):     # Fetches the last transaction_refresh observed for this account from internal database     last_observed_transaction_refresh = get_previous_transaction_refresh(key=account_id)      # Get transactions since the last seen transaction_refresh     response = stripe.financial_connections.Transaction.list(         account=account_id,         transaction_refresh={\"after\": last_observed_transaction_refresh},     )      # We know every transaction is either new or updated because of the `transaction_refresh` filter in the list endpoint     for transaction in response.data:         record_transaction(transaction)  # Saves the transaction to the DB      # Updates the last observed transaction_refresh for this account to the current refresh     set_previous_transaction_refresh(key=account_id, value=current_refresh)``",

Now, when your user submits a document, you can listen to verification results to trigger reactions in your application.\n\nIn this guide, you’ll learn how to:\n\n1.  Receive an event notification when a verification finishes processing.\n2.  Handle successful and failed verification checks.\n3.  Turn your event handler on in production.\n\n[Verification checks](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verification-checks) are asynchronous, which means that verification results aren’t immediately available. When the processing completes, the VerificationSession status updates and the verified information is available. Stripe generates [events](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events) every time a session changes status. In this guide, we’ll implement [webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks) to notify your app when verification results become available.\n\nSee [How sessions work](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/how-sessions-work) to learn the status and lifecycle of verification sessions.\n\n[](#set-up-stripe)\n\nInstall our official libraries for access to the Stripe API from your application:\n\n`# Available as a gem sudo gem install stripe`\n\n`# If you use bundler, you can add this line to your Gemfile gem 'stripe'`\n\n[](#create-webhook)\n\nA [webhook](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks#webhooks-def) is an endpoint on your server that receives requests from Stripe, notifying you about events that happen on your account. In this step, we’ll build an endpoint to receive events on VerificationSession [status changes](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/how-sessions-work).\n\nWebhook endpoints must be publicly accessible so Stripe can send unauthenticated requests. You’ll need to verify that Stripe sent the event by using the Stripe library and request header:\n\n`// Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production. // See your keys here: [https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys) const stripe = require('stripe')(`\n\n`'sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc'`\n\n``);  // You can find your endpoint's secret in your webhook settings const endpointSecret = 'whsec_...';  // This example uses Express to receive webhooks const express = require('express');  // Use body-parser to retrieve the raw body as a buffer const bodyParser = require('body-parser');  const app = express();  // Use JSON parser for all non-webhook routes app.use((req, res, next) => {   if (req.originalUrl === '/webhook') {     next();   } else {     bodyParser.json()(req, res, next);   } });  app.post('/webhook', bodyParser.raw({type: 'application/json'}), (req, res) => {   let event;    // Verify the event came from Stripe   try {     const sig = req.headers['stripe-signature'];     event = stripe.webhooks.constructEvent(req.body, sig, endpointSecret);   } catch (err) {     // On error, log and return the error message     console.log(`❌ Error message: ${err.message}`);     return res.status(400).send(`Webhook Error: ${err.message}`);   }    // Successfully constructed event    res.json({received: true}); });  app.listen(4242, () => {   console.log('Running on port 4242'); });``\n\nNow that you have the basic structure and security in place to listen to notifications from Stripe, update your webhook endpoint to handle verification session events.\n\nAll [session events](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/how-sessions-work#events) include the [VerificationSession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_sessions) object, which contains details about the verification checks performed. See [Accessing verification results](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/access-verification-results) to learn how to retrieve verified information not included in session events.\n\nStripe sends the following events when the session status changes:\n\nYour webhook code needs to handle the `identity.verification_session.verified` and `identity.verification_session.requires_input` events. You can subscribe to other [session events](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/how-sessions-work#events) to trigger additional reactions in your app.\n\n### Handle VerificationSession `verified` status change![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe `identity.verification_session.verified` event is sent when verification checks have completed and are all successfully verified.\n\nAdd code to your event handler to handle all verification checks passing:\n\n`// Set your secret key.

It’s also helpful to go through the [development checklist](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/checklist/go-live) to ensure a smooth transition when taking your integration live.\n\nWebhook endpoints are configured in the Dashboard or programmatically using the API.\n\n### Add an endpoint in the Dashboard![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nIn the Dashboard’s [Webhooks settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks) page, click **Add an endpoint** to add a new webhook endpoint.

  "markdown": "# Review tools | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Learn how to use manual reviews to supplement programmatic systems with human expertise.\n\nWhile Stripe’s programmatic systems work to detect fraudulent verifications, you can perform manual reviews to provide an extra layer of fraud protection.\n\nFor example, you might want to review verifications when:\n\n*   Your customer submits a document from an unexpected country\n*   Your customer contacts you about a potential mistake in their verification\n*   Your business requirements differ from Stripe Identity’s default risk thresholds\n\nManual reviews and [insights](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/insights) in Stripe Identity allow you to examine unusual verifications and update verification statuses.\n\n## Reviewing verifications ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nYou can review verifications in two ways. The [list view](#list-view) allows you to scan a list of verifications without seeing details about a verification, while the [detailed view](#detailed-view) provides more context.\n\n### List view ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nThe list view contains information to help you quickly get a sense of the state of each verification. It includes information on overall verification status, document country, extracted name, and individual verification check status.\n\n![Verification list view](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/list_view.578f9884a1db4a9b57bd59585010d9e3.png)\n\nVerification list view\n\n### Detailed view ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nTo see more information about a verification before making a decision, select the verification from the list view to navigate to a detailed view. In this view, you can inspect the individual images collected alongside available [insights](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/insights).\n\n### Actions ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nAfter you review a verification, take one of the following actions:\n\n*   **Override status**: Manually override the verification status to match your decision on whether or not the customer is verified. Stripe sends a [webhook event](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/handle-verification-outcomes) with the new status.\n*   **Add to blocklist**: Add the document to a blocklist to programmatically block future verifications completed with the same document.\n\n### Biometric duplicates ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nWhen processing new verification attempts, Stripe reviews your completed verifications for duplicate identities using biometric data (for example, based on a selfie) to make sure that each identity is unique.\n\nIf we detect a duplicate selfie, we’ll share a list of verification sessions where the duplicate is detected and how many times it’s found in each session.\n\n## Block list ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nThe block list prevents individuals from using data for verification after you add it to the block list. All future verifications processed with matching data are programmatically marked as ‘unverified‘.\n\nWe support adding block list items of the following types:\n\n*   **Document**: matches against the combination of the type of the document, the document number, and the document country.\n*   **Selfie**: matches against the facial mapping of the selfie image uploaded during verification.\n\nIf you believe there are any mistakes with the block list outcome, you can manually overturn Stripe’s automated decision by [overriding the status](#actions).\n\n### Adding an item![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nFrom the [Identity Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/identity), find the VerificationSession containing the data you want to add to the block list. Navigate to the overflow menu ​​() in the top right, then select **Add to list**.\n\n### Disabling an item![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nOn the block list item details page, you can click **Disable** in the top right. After you confirm your decision in a modal, it disables the item, and future verifications that have data that match are no longer programmatically unverified.\n\nIf you wish to re-enable a block list item, you can visit the VerificationSession that initially created it and create a new item with the same data.\n\n### Deleting an item![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nBy default, if you redact a VerificationSession the associated list items are deleted as well.\n\nIf you want to delete an individual list item, you can click **Delete** in the top right corner of the block list item details page. After you confirm your decision in a modal, the item is permanently disabled and the underlying data is redacted.\n\n## Identity reports ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nIn this report, you can see usage and verification rates over time, including how users progress through the different stages of the verification funnel. This data is reported from your live verification sessions and doesn’t include test mode sessions.\n\nTo access [Identity reports](https://dashboard.stripe.com/identity/overview) from your [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/), navigate to **More** > **Reports**, then select **Identity**. Generate a report by selecting a date range. The earliest date you can choose is when you began using Identity.\n\n### About the data![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nStripe calculates the reporting metrics for [VerificationSessions](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verification-sessions) in a number of ways:\n\n*   **Verifications created**: The total number of verifications created, including those that are abandoned, canceled, redacted, or otherwise unfinished.\n*   **Verifications started**: The number of verifications that a user visited and then started the verification process for.\n*   **Verification submitted**: The number of verifications that were completed and submitted by a user. You’re charged for every submitted verification, regardless of the outcome.\n*   **Verifications successful**: The number of verifications that were verified successfully after submission.\n*   **Completion rate**: The rate at which started verifications were completed and submitted by a user. Stripe divides the number of submitted verifications by the number of started verifications.\n*   **Verification rate**: The rate at which submitted verifications were verified successfully. Stripe divides the number of verified verifications by the number of submitted verifications.\n\nVerification sessions can have multiple attempts (in case the user is unverified after an initial attempt). Each attempt generates a new [VerificationReport](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_reports), and Stripe calculates a number of verification report metrics:\n\n*   **Verification reports created**: The number of verification attempts that were completed and submitted.\n*   **Verification reports successful**: The number of verification attempts that were verified successfully after submission.\n\n## Best practices ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nUse the following best practices to get the most out of reviews and perform them efficiently:\n\n*   **Focus on verifications where human judgment or manual review adds valuable insight to the determination of whether the customer’s identity is verified.**\n    \n    Our systems can make determinations on identity verification on the majority of verification sessions, but human judgment can improve accuracy for some cases.\n    \n*   **Use insights and context from your business to make an informed decision.**\n    \n    Use the data in the [Insights](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/insights) section to see how Stripe made the decision on the document or face image. Combining Insights, knowledge about your business, and human judgment can help you make an informed choice about when to trust or ignore the risk signals that Identity indicates.\n    \n*   **Apply what reviewers learn to develop fraud prevention strategies.**\n    \n    As reviewers sort through your verifications, they develop intuitions for fraud prevention that you can translate into updates to your integration with Identity.\n    \n*   **Customize the process by presenting data unique to your business at review time.**\n    \n    Pass along any additional customer information as metadata so that all relevant information is in the Dashboard at the time of review.\n    \n*   **Don’t slow down your customer.**\n    \n    A review implies some amount of time between verification completion and enabling the capabilities within your business for the customer. If your business has an inherent delay of this type (for example, Identity is a part of a more long form review process), taking the time to review a verification doesn’t change the customer experience. If you don’t have a built-in delay, adding a review process could slow down customers—consider the impact on them before you implement a review process. For example, build out workflows for handling situations when the verification status changes for a customer after they’ve already been verified.\n    \n*   **Implement customer support workflows.**\n    \n    Prepare to handle customer requests regarding their verification status and offer a non-biometric method for identity verification if they request it.",

Now you might need access to the sensitive verification results such as your user’s date of birth or pictures of the collected document.\n\nFirst, consider using the [Identity Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/identity) to access sensitive verification results. If needed, [give team members controlled access](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/teams) to your Stripe account. This saves you development time and ensures the sensitive verification data is kept [securely](https://support.stripe.com/questions/managing-your-id-verification-information) on Stripe.\n\nYou can [access most verification details programmatically](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verification-sessions#results), such as the result of a verification check or the user’s name and address using your [secret key](https://docs.stripe.com/keys). Access to more sensitive fields require the use of [restricted API keys](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#limit-access).\n\n| Verification result | Available in Dashboard | Secret key access | Restricted API key access |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Address |     |     |     |\n| Document type |     |     |     |\n| First and last names |     |     |     |\n| Issuing country of the document |     |     |     |\n| Result of the verification check |     |     |     |\n| Issued date of the document |     |     |     |\n| Type of ID number |     |     |     |\n| Email address |     |     |     |\n| Phone number |     |     |     |\n| Expiration date of the document |     |     |     |\n| Date of birth |     |     |     |\n| Document ID number |     |     |     |\n| Document images |     |     |     |\n| Face images |     |     |     |\n| ID number |     |     |     |\n\nRestricted API keys allow access based on the security measures associated with it:\n\n*   **Restricted keys** — Allow access to sensitive verification results for verifications processed in the last 48 hours.\n*   **IP restricted keys** - Allow access to sensitive verification results for all verifications.\n\nIn this guide, you’ll learn how to:\n\n1.  Consider your sensitive data access requirements carefully.\n2.  Create restricted API keys.\n3.  Make API requests to obtain sensitive verification results.\n4.  Roll your keys if they’re compromised.\n5.  Communicate your sensitive verification results and security measures to your users.\n6.

Make API requests to obtain sensitive verification results.\n4.  Roll your keys if they’re compromised.\n5.  Communicate your sensitive verification results and security measures to your users.\n\n[](#decide-access-requirements)\n\nTo build an integration with Stripe Identity that prioritizes your user’s privacy, you must first decide the minimum amount of PII that you need access to. If you don’t need access to the most sensitive data (that requires authentication with a restricted API key), then your integration can authenticate using your secret key only.\n\nTo access PII resulting from a verification, you can retrieve a VerificationSession and [expand](https://docs.stripe.com/api/expanding_objects) either the [`verified_outputs`](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_sessions/object#identity_verification_session_object-verified_outputs) field or - if you need more granular detail on the verification result - the [`last_verification_report`](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_sessions/object#identity_verification_session_object-last_verification_report). Expanding either of these fields automatically includes all of the PII fields they contain that only require a secret key.\n\nHere is an example of how to expand the `verified_outputs` field to retrieve a user’s name that was verified by Stripe Identity.\n\n`// Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production. // See your keys here: [https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys) const stripe = require('stripe')(`\n\n`'sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc'`\n\n`);  const verificationSession = await stripe.identity.verificationSessions.retrieve(   '{{SESSION_ID}}',   {     expand: [       'verified_outputs',     ],   } );  const firstName = verificationSession.verified_outputs.first_name;`\n\nIf you do need to access sensitive PII that requires a restricted key, follow the steps in this guide.\n\n[](#create-restricted-key)\n\nYou can use your account’s secret API keys to perform any API request without restriction. Accessing sensitive verification results requires [restricted keys](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#limit-access), which are more secure.\n\nTo create a new restricted key,\n\n1.  Go to the [API keys page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys) in the Dashboard and click [**Create restricted key**](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys/create).\n2.  Name your key.\n3.  Make sure the Identity **Verification Sessions and Reports** and **Access recent sensitive verification results** permissions are set to **Read**.\n4.  (optional) If you need to access collected images, add the Files **Write** permission.\n5.  Click **Create key**.\n6.  Store the key securely.

VerificationReports are created when all verification checks for a session are processed. They allow you to understand why a verification check failed and what data was successfully verified.\n\nYou can [expand](https://docs.stripe.com/expand) the [`last_verification_report`](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_sessions/object#identity_verification_session_object-last_verification_report) session field to retrieve the associated VerificationReport.\n\nBy default, VerificationReports don’t include sensitive verification results. To access these, you’ll need to:\n\n1.  Authenticate using the restricted API key created in step 1.\n2.  [Expand](https://docs.stripe.com/api/expanding_objects) the fields you want to access.\n\nHere’s an example of accessing the extracted date of birth, ID number, and document number from a [document check](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verification-checks?type=document):\n\n`// Set your restricted key. Remember to switch to a live restricted key in production. // See your keys here: [https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys) const stripe = require('stripe')('rk_test_...');  const verificationSession = await stripe.identity.verificationSessions.retrieve(   '{{SESSION_ID}}',   {     expand: [       'verified_outputs.dob',       'verified_outputs.id_number',       'last_verification_report.document.number',     ],   } );  const dateOfBirth = verificationSession.verified_outputs.dob; const idNumber = verificationSession.verified_outputs.id_number; const documentNumber = verificationSession.last_verification_report.document.number;`\n\n## Accessing collected images ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nYou can retrieve identity document and face images that you collect as part of a session using the [File Upload API](https://docs.stripe.com/file-upload). The following fields on a VerificationReport can hold a reference to a [File](https://docs.stripe.com/api/files) resource in the Stripe API:\n\n*   [`document.files`](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_reports/object#identity_verification_report_object-document-front) - images of the identity document\n*   [`selfie.document`](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_reports/object#identity_verification_report_object-selfie-document) - image of the photo ID front\n*   [`selfie.selfie`](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_reports/object#identity_verification_report_object-selfie-selfie) - image of the user’s face\n\n#### Note\n\nDocument and face images are very sensitive and some countries, such as Germany, have laws prohibiting ID Document images from being shared or kept longer than necessary. As much as possible, access image content with short-lived FileLinks, don’t make copies of the file contents, and [redact sessions](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verification-sessions#redact) and collected images when you’re done using them for the purpose collected.\n\nTo access the contents of the file, you need to authenticate using the previously created restricted key and [Create a FileLink](https://docs.stripe.com/api/file_links/create) with a short expiration and send the [`url`](https://docs.stripe.com/api/file_links/object#file_link_object-url) to the client:\n\n`// Set your restricted key.

Accounts and customers that you make in test mode are invisible to your live mode integration.\n\n#### Note\n\nThe Financial Connections [authentication flow](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/fundamentals#authentication-flow) is subject to change, so we don’t recommend automated client-side testing. Stripe’s test mode API is also strictly [rate limited](https://docs.stripe.com/testing#rate-limits), which you must account for in your tests.\n\n[](#web-how-to-use-test-accounts)\n\nWhen you provide [Stripe.js](https://docs.stripe.com/js) with a Financial Connections Session token created using test keys, the [authentication flow](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/fundamentals#authentication-flow) exclusively shows a selection of test institutions managed by Stripe. The client can link accounts from any of these institutions without providing credentials.\n\nFeatures like [balances](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/balances), [account ownership](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/ownership), and [transactions](https://docs.stripe.com/financial-connections/transactions) work the same way as they do in live mode, except they return testing data instead of real account data.\n\nTest mode [webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks \"webhook\") are separate from live webhooks. Learn about [testing your webhook integrations](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks#test-webhook).\n\n[](#web-test-institutions)\n\nStripe provides a set of test institutions exercising different success and failure scenarios, each represented as a bank in the list of featured institutions.\n\n#### Simulating successful authentication![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n*   **Test Institution**: Simulates the user successfully logging into their institution and contains a basic set of test accounts.\n*   **Test OAuth Institution**: Contains the same test accounts as Test Institution, but instead of authenticating directly with the modal, it opens an OAuth popup for authentication.\n*   **Ownership Accounts**: Contains test accounts representing different ownership states.\n*   **Sandbox Bank (OAuth)**: Provides a test institution OAuth popup that allows you to select accounts to link. Sandbox Bank is the most representative of account linking for the majority of live mode institutions.\n*   **Sandbox Bank (Non-OAuth)**: Provides a Stripe-hosted login form to simulate institutions that don’t support OAuth. Use the following test credentials to proceed:\n    *   The initial prompt asks for username and password. Entering any input value simulates a successful login.\n    *   In the password field or any subsequent field, enter `options` (selection from a list), `mfa` (one-time passcode entry), or `security_question` (secret answer entry) to exercise further login prompts.\n    *   Entering `error` in any field ends the login session; `incorrect` gives you a chance to try again.\n*   **Invalid Payment Accounts**: Contains test accounts that are unusable for ACH payments.\n\n#### Simulating failed authentication![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n*   **Down bank (scheduled)**: The institution’s login API is unavailable for a known time period that the institution communicated to Stripe.\n*   **Down bank (unscheduled)**: The institution’s login API is unavailable without any information about the downtime communicated to Stripe.\n*   **Down bank (error)**: Stripe is experiencing an unknown error communicating with the institution.\n\n#### Note\n\nWe recommend manually testing OAuth and non-OAuth institutions to make sure that both UI flows work within the context your application.

  "markdown": "# Embedded onboarding | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Show a localized onboarding form that validates data.\n\nEmbedded onboarding is a highly themeable onboarding UI with limited Stripe branding. Your platform embeds the [Account onboarding component](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/supported-embedded-components/account-onboarding) in your application, and your connected accounts interact with the embedded component without ever leaving your application. Embedded onboarding uses the [Accounts API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts) to read the requirements and generate an onboarding form with robust data validation and is localized for all Stripe-supported countries. In addition, embedded onboarding handles all:\n\n*   Business types\n*   Configurations of company representatives\n*   Verification document uploading\n*   Identify verification and statuses\n*   International bank accounts\n*   Error states\n\n[](#create-account)\n\nCreate a [connected account](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts) with the default [controller](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/create#create_account-controller) properties. See [design an integration](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/design-an-integration) to learn more about controller properties. Alternatively, you can create a connected account by specifying an account [type](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/create#create_account-type).\n\n`curl -X POST https://api.stripe.com/v1/accounts \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\"`\n\nIf you know the country for your connected account, you can provide that information when you create the account. The country defaults to the same country as your platform if not provided.\n\nIf you need to request [capabilities](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-capabilities) for your connected account, you can provide that information when you create the account and Stripe’s onboarding UIs collect the requirements for those capabilities. To reduce onboarding effort, request only the capabilities you need. If you omit capabilities and your connected account has Express Dashboard access, Stripe-hosted onboarding uses the [Configuration settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect/onboarding-options/countries) to automatically request capabilities based on the account’s country.\n\nIf you have information about the account holder (like their name, address, or other details), you can proactively provide this when you [create](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/create) or [update](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/update) the account. Stripe-hosted onboarding asks the account holder to confirm the pre-filled information before accepting the [Connect service agreement](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/service-agreement-types). Providing more information through the API reduces the number of prompts and enhances the onboarding flow for your connected account.\n\nAdditionally, if you onboard an account without its own website and your platform provides the account with a URL, prefill the account’s [business\\_profile.url](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/create#create_account-business_profile-url). If the account doesn’t have a URL, you can prefill its [business\\_profile.product\\_description](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/create#create_account-business_profile-product_description) instead.\n\nWhen testing your integration, use [test data](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/testing) to simulate different outcomes including identity verification, business information verification, payout failures, and more.\n\n[](#info-to-collect)\n\nAs the platform, you must decide if you want to collect the required information from your connected accounts upfront or incrementally. Upfront onboarding collects the `eventually_due` requirements for the account, while incremental onboarding only collects the `currently_due` requirements.\n\n|     | Upfront onboarding | Incremental onboarding |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Advantages** | *   Entails a single request for information (normally)<br>*   Creates fewer problems in receiving payouts and maintaining processing ability<br>*   Exposes potential fraudsters or connected accounts who refuse to provide required information later | *   Onboards connected accounts quickly<br>*   Results in higher onboarding rates |\n| **Disadvantages** | *   Onboarding connected accounts can take longer<br>*   Some legitimate new connected accounts might turn away due to the amount of information required before they complete the onboarding process | *   Creates a higher likelihood of disrupting business of an ongoing connected account |\n\nTo determine whether to use upfront or incremental onboarding, review the [required information](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information) for the countries where your connected accounts are located to understand the requirements that are eventually due. While Stripe tries to minimize any impact to connected accounts, requirements might change over time.\n\nFor connected accounts where you’re responsible for requirement collection, you can customize the behavior of [future requirements](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/handle-verification-updates) using the `collectionOptions` attribute when integrating the Account onboarding component.\n\n[](#customize-policies-shown-to-your-users)\n\nConnected accounts see Stripe’s service agreement and [Privacy Policy](https://stripe.com/privacy) during embedded onboarding. Connected account users who haven’t [accepted Stripe’s services agreement](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/service-agreement-types#accepting-the-correct-agreement) must accept it on the final onboarding screen. Embedded onboarding also has a footer with links to Stripe’s service agreement and [Privacy Policy](https://stripe.com/privacy).\n\nFor connected accounts where the platform is responsible for requirement collection, you have additional options to customize the onboarding flow, as outlined below.\n\n### Handle service agreement acceptance on your own![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nIf you’re a platform onboarding connected accounts where you’re responsible for requirement collection, you can [collect Terms of Service acceptance](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/updating-service-agreements#tos-acceptance) using your own process instead of using the embedded account onboarding component. If using your own process, the final onboarding screen only asks your connected accounts to confirm the information they entered, and you must secure their acceptance of Stripe’s service agreement.\n\nEmbedded onboarding still has links to the terms of service (for example, in the footer) that you can replace by [linking to your own agreements and privacy policy](#link-to-your-own-agreements-and-privacy-policy).\n\n### Link to your agreements and privacy policy ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nConnected accounts see the Stripe service agreement and [Privacy Policy](https://stripe.com/privacy) throughout embedded onboarding. For the connected accounts where you’re responsible for requirement collection, you can replace the links with your own agreements and policy. Follow the instructions to [incorporate the Stripe services agreement](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/updating-service-agreements#adding-stripes-service-agreement-to-your-terms-of-service) and [link to the Stripe Privacy Policy](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/updating-service-agreements#disclosing-how-stripe-processes-user-data).\n\n[](#integrate-account-onboarding-component)\n\nCreate an [Account Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_sessions) by specifying the ID of the connected account and `account_onboarding` as the component to enable.\n\n## Create an Account Session![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nWhen [creating an Account Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_sessions/create), enable account onboarding by specifying `account_onboarding` in the `components` parameter.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/account_sessions \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d account=  {{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}   \\  -d \"components[account_onboarding][enabled]\"=true \\  -d \"components[account_onboarding][features][external_account_collection]\"=true`\n\nAfter creating the Account Session and [initializing ConnectJS](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-connect-embedded-components#account-sessions), you can render the Account onboarding component in the front end:\n\n`// Include this element in your HTML const accountOnboarding = stripeConnectInstance.create('account-onboarding'); accountOnboarding.setOnExit(() => {   console.log('User exited the onboarding flow'); }); container.appendChild(accountOnboarding);  // Optional: make sure to follow our policy instructions above // accountOnboarding.setFullTermsOfServiceUrl('{{URL}}') // accountOnboarding.setRecipientTermsOfServiceUrl('{{URL}}') // accountOnboarding.setPrivacyPolicyUrl('{{URL}}') // accountOnboarding.setSkipTermsOfServiceCollection(false) // accountOnboarding.setCollectionOptions({ //   fields: 'eventually_due', //   futureRequirements: 'include', // })`\n\n| Method | Type | Description | Default |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `setFullTermsOfServiceUrl` | `string` | Absolute URL to your [full terms of service](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/service-agreement-types#full) agreement. | [Stripe’s full service agreement](https://stripe.com/connect-account/legal/full) |\n| `setRecipientTermsOfServiceUrl` | `string` | Absolute URL to your [recipient terms of service](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/service-agreement-types#recipient) agreement. | [Stripe’s recipient service agreement](https://stripe.com/connect-account/legal/recipient) |\n| `setPrivacyPolicyUrl` | `string` | Absolute URL to your privacy policy. | [Stripe’s privacy policy](https://stripe.com/privacy) |\n| `setSkipTermsOfServiceCollection` | `string` | If true, embedded onboarding skips terms of service collection and you must [collect terms acceptance yourself](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/updating-service-agreements#indicating-acceptance). | false |\n| `setCollectionOptions` | `{ fields: 'currently_due' \\| 'eventually_due', future_requirements: 'omit' \\| 'include' }` | Customizes collecting `currently_due` or `eventually_due` requirements and controls whether to include [future requirements](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-future_requirements).

Create a [connected account](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts). You can prefill information on the account object in this API call.\n2.  [Initialize Connect embedded components](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-connect-embedded-components#account-sessions) using the ID of the connected account.\n3.  Include the `account-onboarding` element to show the onboarding flow to the connected account.\n4.  Listen for the `exit` event emitted from this component. Stripe sends this event when the connected account exits the onboarding process.\n\n[\n\n## Handle new requirements becoming due![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n\n\n](#handle-new-requirements-becoming-due)\n\nSet up your integration to [listen for changes](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/handling-api-verification#verification-process) to account requirements. You can test handling new requirements (and how they might disable charges and payouts) with the [test mode trigger cards](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/testing#trigger-cards). Stripe notifies you when [upcoming requirements updates](https://support.stripe.com/user/questions/onboarding-requirements-updates) affect your connected accounts.\n\nYou can proactively collect information to fulfill [future requirements](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-future_requirements). Based on the verification needs of your application, send the connected account back into onboarding as necessary to satisfy `currently_due` or `eventually_due` requirements. You can use this as a signal of when to send your connected account back into the flow.\n\nYou don’t need to worry about what the requirements are—sending the connected account back into onboarding collects the right information. For example, if your connected account mistypes their information and they can’t be verified, they could be asked to provide an identity document (for example, a Driver’s License in the United States). Sending this user into onboarding prompts them to upload such a document to make sure they’re verified.\n\n### Handle verification errors ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nListen to the [account.updated](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-account.updated) event. If the account contains any `currently_due` fields when the `current_deadline` arrives, the corresponding functionality is disabled and those fields are added to `past_due`.\n\nLet your accounts remediate their verification requirements by directing them to the [Account onboarding component](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/supported-embedded-components/account-onboarding).\n\n## See also![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n*   [Get started with Connect embedded components](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-connect-embedded-components)\n*   [Customize embedded components](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/customize-connect-embedded-components)",

  "markdown": "# Verification checks | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Learn about the different verification checks supported by Stripe Identity.\n\nStripe Identity currently supports five types of verification checks: document, selfie, ID number, address, and phone.\n\nEach verification check requires different information from your user, has different coverage, and has a different verification flow. After you’ve integrated one check, you can add another with minimal changes to your integration.\n\nDocument checks verify the authenticity of government-issued identity documents. Stripe uses a combination of machine learning models, automated heuristic analysis and manual reviewers to verify the authenticity of hundreds of different document types.\n\nMachine learning models are used to capture high-definition pictures of the fronts and backs of documents. The document images are analyzed in real-time to check for legibility and warn the user if the document is expired or unlikely to be verified. Stripe checks the images against a database of fraudulent document templates. This database is updated frequently, so that Stripe can detect new fake document templates and automatically block them.\n\nWherever available, barcodes and other machine-readable features of the document are decoded and consistency checks are performed to ensure that the text document data matches the machine-readable data.\n\nTo prevent “presentation attacks” — fraudster using pictures of stolen documents or someone else’s face, Stripe uses computer vision and machine learning algorithms to ensure the user captured an image of an actual document.\n\nSee the [Verify your users’ identity documents](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verify-identity-documents) guide to learn how to integrate document checks into your app.\n\nAdditionally, document checks can also be [paired with ID number checks](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_sessions/create#create_identity_verification_session-options-document-require_id_number).

  "markdown": "# Adding selfie checks | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Learn how to add face similarity checks to prevent fraudsters from using stolen documents.\n\nWhile [document checks](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verification-checks?type=document) provide a defense against the use of fraudulent identity documents, it’s possible for fraudsters to get access to legitimate stolen documents. To prevent this, Stripe Identity can perform selfie checks on your users.\n\nSelfie checks look for distinguishing biological traits, such as face geometry, from a photo ID and a picture of your user’s face. Stripe then uses advanced machine learning algorithms to ensure the face pictures belong to the same person.\n\nTo add selfie checks to your application, first follow the guide to [collect and verify identity documents](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verify-identity-documents).\n\n## Adding selfie checks to VerificationSessions ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nWhen [creating a VerificationSession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_sessions/create), use the [`options.document.require_matching_selfie`](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_sessions/create#create_identity_verification_session-options-document-require_matching_selfie) parameter to enable selfie checks.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/identity/verification_sessions \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d type=document \\  -d \"options[document][require_matching_selfie]\"=true`\n\nThis configures the verification flow to require a photo ID and a face picture from your user.\n\n## Accessing selfie check results ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nAfter it’s submitted and processed, the VerificationSession [status](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/how-sessions-work) changes depending on the result of the checks:\n\n*   `verified` — Both the document and selfie checks were successful. The session [`verified_outputs`](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_sessions/object#identity_verification_session_object-verified_outputs) contains extracted information from the document.\n*   `requires_input` — At least one of the document or the selfie checks failed.\n\nTo access the captured selfie and document images, you’ll need to retrieve the associated [VerificationReport](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_reports), you can do this by [expanding](https://docs.stripe.com/api/expanding_objects) the [`last_verification_report`](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_sessions/object#identity_verification_session_object-last_verification_report) field in the session:\n\n`// Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production. // See your keys here: [https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys) const stripe = require('stripe')(`\n\n`'sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc'`\n\n`); const verificationSession = await stripe.identity.verificationSessions.retrieve(   '{{SESSION_ID}}',   {     expand: ['last_verification_report'],   } ); const verificationReport = verificationSession.last_verification_report;`\n\nThe VerificationReport has [`document`](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_reports/object#identity_verification_report_object-document) and [`selfie`](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_reports/object#identity_verification_report_object-selfie) fields holding the results of the document and selfie checks. Here’s an example VerificationReport with successful document and selfie checks:\n\n`{   \"id\": \"vr_iwNFg6uFn4rVNcDPngKcCLMW\",   \"object\": \"identity.verification_report\",   \"type\": \"document\",   \"verification_session\": \"vs_hBCzBeDkd0OCLpkMtXFO83uJ\",   \"created\": 1611776872,   \"livemode\": true,   \"options\": {     \"document\": {       \"require_matching_selfie\": true     }   },   \"document\": {     \"status\": \"verified\",     \"error\": null,     \"first_name\": \"Jenny\",     \"last_name\": \"Rosen\",     \"address\": {       \"line1\": \"1234 Main St.\",       \"city\": \"San Francisco\",       \"state\": \"CA\",       \"postal_code\": \"94111\",       \"country\": \"US\"     },     \"document_type\": \"id_card\",     \"expiration_date\": {       \"day\": 17,       \"month\": 7,       \"year\": 2024     },     \"files\": [\"file_4mSp3DBBhXuIQWVXInyhQsc8\", \"file_lZDkCFZMqBRPHc5QFznpGjpO\"],     \"issued_date\": {       \"day\": 4,       \"month\": 27,       \"year\": 2021     },     \"issuing_country\": \"US\"   },   \"selfie\": {     \"status\": \"verified\",     \"error\": null,     \"document\": \"file_sEPYkj9O5q1gqPphno8Qdxd0\",     \"selfie\": \"file_dNcXwELYqIsn7polvkIeMG3i\",   } }`\n\nTo access the collected document and face images, see [Accessing verification results](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/access-verification-results).\n\n## Understanding selfie check failures ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nThe [`document`](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_reports/object#identity_verification_report_object-document) and [`selfie`](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_reports/object#identity_verification_report_object-selfie) VerificationReport fields contain the collected data as well as a `status` and `error` fields to help you understand whether the check is successful or not.\n\nThe `status` field tells you whether each check is successful or not. The possible values are:\n\n*   `verified` - The verification check is successful and the collected data is verified.\n*   `unverified` - The verification check failed. You can check the `error` hash for more information.\n\nWhen the verification check fails, the `error` field contains `code` and `reason` values to explain the verification failure. The `error.code` field can be used to programmatically handle verification failures. The `reason` field contains a descriptive message explaining the failure reason and can be shown to your user.\n\n### Document check failures ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nFailure details are available in the report [`document.error`](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_reports/object#identity_verification_report_object-document-error) field.\n\n| Error code | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `document_expired` | The provided identity document has expired. |\n| `document_unverified_other` | Stripe couldn’t verify the provided identity document.

  "markdown": "# The Verification Sessions API | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Learn more about the Verification Sessions API that powers Stripe Identity.\n\nUse the [Verification Session API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_sessions) to securely collect information and perform [verification checks](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verification-checks). This API tracks a verification, from initial creation through the entire verification process, and shows verification results upon completion.\n\nFor a step-by-step guide on using the Verification Session API to verify your users’ identity document, follow the related guide: [Verify your users’ identity documents](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verify-identity-documents).\n\n## Creating a VerificationSession ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nWhen you [create the VerificationSession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_sessions/create), determine which [verification check](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verification-checks) to perform by specifying the session [`type`](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_sessions/create#create_identity_verification_session-type):\n\n*   [`document`](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verification-checks?type=document) - Verify the authenticity and ownership of government-issued identity documents. Can also include a [selfie check](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/selfie).\n*   [`id_number`](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verification-checks?type=id-number) - Verify a user’s name, date of birth and national ID number.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/identity/verification_sessions \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d type=document`\n\n### Best practices ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nIf the verification process is interrupted and resumes later, attempt to reuse the same VerificationSession instead of creating a new one. Each VerificationSession has a unique ID that you can use to [retrieve](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_sessions/retrieve) it. In your application’s data model, you can store the VerificationSession’s ID to facilitate retrieval.\n\nThe benefit of reusing the VerificationSession is that the object helps track any failed verification attempts. If any of the checks fail, the VerificationSession will have a `requires_input` status.\n\nWe recommend that you provide an [idempotency key](https://docs.stripe.com/api/idempotent_requests) when creating the VerificationSession to avoid erroneously creating duplicate VerificationSessions for the same person. This key is typically based on the ID that you associate with the verification in your application, like a user reference.\n\n## Passing the client secret to the frontend ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nThe VerificationSession contains a [client secret](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_sessions/object#identity_verification_session_object-client_secret), a key that’s unique to the individual VerificationSession. The front end uses the client secret to complete the verification.\n\nTo use the client secret, you must obtain it from the VerificationSession on your server and pass it to the frontend. You can retrieve the client secret from an endpoint on your server using the browser’s `fetch` function on the client. This approach is generally most suitable when the client is a single-page application, especially one built with a modern frontend framework such as React.\n\nThis example shows how to create the server endpoint that serves the client secret:\n\n`// Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production. // See your keys here: [https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys) const stripe = require('stripe')(`\n\n`'sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc'`\n\n`);  // In the route handler for /create-verification-session: // Authenticate your user.  // Create the session. const verificationSession = await stripe.identity.verificationSessions.create({   type: 'document',   metadata: {     user_id: '{{USER_ID}}',   }, });  // Return only the client secret to the frontend. const clientSecret = verificationSession.client_secret;`\n\nThis example demonstrates how to fetch the client secret with JavaScript on the client side:\n\n`(async () => {   const response = await fetch('/create-verification-session');   const {client_secret: clientSecret} = await response.json();   // Call stripe.verifyIdentity() with the client secret. })();`\n\n#### Note\n\nThe client secret is a sensitive token that you can use to complete the verification. Don’t log it, embed it in URLs, or expose it to anyone but the user that you’re verifying. Make sure that you have [TLS](https://docs.stripe.com/security/guide#tls \"TLS\") on any page that includes the client secret.\n\n## Accessing verification results ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nSubmitting and processing a VerificationSession updates the session `status` and creates a [VerificationReport](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_reports/object) object. This normally happens within a few minutes.\n\nOnce all of the verification checks have passed, the status changes to `verified`. You can [expand](https://docs.stripe.com/api/expanding_objects) the [`verified_outputs`](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_sessions/object#identity_verification_session_object-verified_outputs) field to see the verified data.\n\n`{   \"id\": \"vs_lXX1JHkgT40CIMn4ctwUG1NY\",   \"object\": \"identity.verification_session\",   \"created\": 1610744321,   \"last_error\": null,   \"last_verification_report\": \"vr_qxsbKXREpnMSq18J67rho6Dh\",   \"livemode\": true,   \"metadata\": {},   \"options\": {     \"document\": {},   },   \"status\": \"verified\",   \"type\": \"document\",   \"redaction\": null,   \"url\": null,   \"verified_outputs\": {     \"first_name\": \"Jenny\",     \"last_name\": \"Rosen\",     \"address\": {       \"line1\": \"1234 Main St.\",       \"city\": \"San Francisco\",       \"state\": \"CA\",       \"postal_code\": \"94111\",       \"country\": \"US\"     },     \"id_number_type\": null   } }`\n\nIf any of the verification checks fail, the session will have a `requires_input` [status](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/how-sessions-work). Verification failure details are available in the session [`last_error`](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_sessions/object#identity_verification_session_object-last_error) hash. The [`last_error.code`](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_sessions/object#identity_verification_session_object-last_error-code) value can be used to programmatically handle common verification failures. The [`last_error.reason`](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_sessions/object#identity_verification_session_object-last_error-code) will contain a string that explains the failure reason and can be shown to your user.\n\n`{   \"id\": \"vs_Lt3uT7nqsJFL5J8cDZci5nUF\",   \"object\": \"identity.verification_session\",   \"created\": 1610744321,   \"last_error\": {     \"code\": \"document_expired\",     \"reason\": \"The document is expired.\",   },   \"last_verification_report\": \"vr_1ExIfyV6HWvL9CdSL4ExYt5r\",   \"livemode\": true,   \"metadata\": {},   \"options\": {},   \"status\": \"requires_input\",   \"type\": \"document\",   \"redaction\": null,   \"url\": null, }`\n\nIf you want your user to attempt verification again, you’ll need to [Retrieve the VerificationSession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_sessions/retrieve) to get a fresh URL or client secret to pass to your client.\n\nLearn how to [access sensitive verification results](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/access-verification-results)\n\n## Cancelling a VerificationSession ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nYou can cancel a VerificationSession at any point before it’s `processing` or `verified`. This invalidates the VerificationSession for future submission attempts, and can’t be undone. The session will have a `canceled` [status](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/how-sessions-work).\n\n`curl -X POST https://api.stripe.com/v1/identity/verification_sessions/`\n\n`{{VERIFICATION_SESSION_ID}}`\n\n`/cancel \\  -u \"  sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc  :\"`\n\n## Redacting a VerificationSession ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nOne of the reasons that you might want to redact a verification session is if you receive a data deletion request from your user. You can redact a session to ensure collected information is no longer returned by the Stripe API or visible in Dashboard. You can still [retrieve](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_sessions/retrieve) redacted sessions with the API but you can’t update them. Sessions can be redacted from the Dashboard or through the API:\n\n`curl -X POST https://api.stripe.com/v1/identity/verification_sessions/`\n\n`{{VERIFICATION_SESSION_ID}}`\n\n`/redact \\  -u \"  sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc  :\"`\n\nRedacted sessions show placeholder values for all fields that previously contained personally identifiable information (PII). The session includes a [`redaction.status`](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_sessions/object#identity_verification_session_object-redaction-status) field indicating the status of the redaction process. An [`identity.verification_session.redacted`](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-identity.verification_session.redacted) webhook will be sent when the session is redacted. Please note redaction can take up to 4 days.\n\nIf a VerificationSession that has been redacted is retrieved with PII fields expanded, then these fields will still appear in the response but their values will not contain any PII. For example, here is a response that has expanded the `verified_outputs` and `verified_outputs.dob` fields on a redacted VerificationSession.\n\n`{   \"id\": \"vs_5k6tWo61v2vl7tlY0M5Y3Urh\",   \"object\": \"identity.verification_session\",   \"created\": 1610744321,   \"last_error\": null,   \"last_verification_report\": \"vr_YWcHeeGz2sELes2glkuxfOJz\",   \"livemode\": true,   \"options\": {},   \"status\": \"verified\",   \"type\": \"document\",   \"url\": null,   \"client_secret\": null,   \"redaction\": {     \"status\": \"redacted\"   },   \"verified_outputs\": {     \"first_name\": \"[redacted]\",     \"last_name\": \"[redacted]\",     \"dob\": {       \"year\": 1,       \"month\": 1,       \"day\": 1     },     \"address\": {       \"line1\": \"[redacted]\",       \"city\": \"[redacted]\",       \"state\": \"[redacted]\",       \"postal_code\": \"[redacted]\",       \"country\": \"US\"     },     \"id_number_type\": null   },   \"metadata\": {} // Metadata will also be redacted }`\n\nAny [VerificationReports](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_reports), [Events](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events), and [Request Logs](https://dashboard.stripe.com/logs) associated with the VerificationSession are also redacted and [File](https://docs.stripe.com/api/files) contents are no longer downloadable.\n\nIf the VerificationSession is in the `processing` state you must wait until it finishes before redacting it. Redacting a VerificationSession with `requires_action` status automatically cancels it.\n\nStripe supports adding [metadata](https://docs.stripe.com/api#metadata) to the VerificationSession object. Metadata isn’t shown to customers or factored into whether a verification check succeeds or fails.\n\nThrough metadata, you can associate other information—meaningful to you—with Stripe activity. Any metadata you include is viewable in the Dashboard (for example, when looking at the page for an individual session), and is also available in common reports. As an example, you can attach your application’s user ID to the VerificationSession used to verify that user. Doing so allows you, or your team to easily reconcile verifications in Stripe to users in your system.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/identity/verification_sessions \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d type=document \\  -d \"metadata[user_id]\"={{USER_ID}} \\   -d \"metadata[reference]\"={{IDENTIFIER}}`\n\nWe recommend you don’t store any sensitive information (PII, ID numbers, and so on) in session metadata.

  "markdown": "# Pending updates | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Learn how to handle payment failures when updating subscriptions.\n\nUpdating a [subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/creating \"subscriptions\") generates a new [invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices \"invoices\") when:\n\n*   The subscription requires payment for the first time, such as the end of a trial period.\n*   The billing period changes.\n*   Changing the subscription causes a proration and `proration_behavior=always_invoice`.\n\nBy default, updates are applied regardless of whether payment on the new invoice succeeds. If payment fails, rolling back the updates is a manual process. You need to create a new invoice, prorate items on the invoice, and then initiate payment again. However, with the pending updates feature, you can make changes to subscriptions only if payment succeeds on the new invoice.\n\n#### Caution\n\nPending updates aren’t supported when the subscription’s [collection\\_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/object#subscription_object-collection_method) is `send_invoice` or when bank debits are used as the payment method for the subscription.\n\n[](#update-subscription)\n\nYou can use pending updates with the [update subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/update), [create subscription item](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscription_items/create), and [update subscription item](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscription_items/update) calls. When you make the update, set `payment_behavior=pending_if_incomplete`. The example below adds a new price to a subscription. Because `proration_behavior=always_invoice`, an invoice is created and payment is attempted when the update is made.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/subscriptions/sub_49ty4767H20z6a \\   -u` \n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`: \\   -d \"payment_behavior\"=\"pending_if_incomplete\" \\   -d \"proration_behavior\"=\"always_invoice\" \\   -d \"items[0][id]\"=\"si_09IkI4u3ZypJUk5onGUZpe8O\" \\   -d \"items[0][price]\"=\"price_CBb6IXqvTLXp3f\"`\n\nIf payment succeeds, the subscription is updated. If payment fails, the `Subscription` object that’s returned contains a `pending_update` hash with the changes:\n\n`{   \"id\": \"sub_49ty4767H20z6a\",   \"object\": \"subscription\",   \"application_fee_percent\": null,   \"pending_update\": {     \"expires_at\": 1571194285,     \"subscription_items\": [       {         \"id\": \"si_09IkI4u3ZypJUk5onGUZpe8O\",         \"price\": \"price_CBb6IXqvTLXp3f\"       }     ]   }, }`\n\n[\n\n## Handling failed payments![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n\n\n](#handling-failed-payments)\n\nAfter making the update, check the `pending_update` hash on the subscription. If you want to be notified automatically, you can build a [webhook](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks \"webhook\") that listens for the `customer.subscription.updated` event. If the `pending_update` hash is populated, the payment failed and the subscription will continue to cycle as if no update request was made.\n\nPayments often fail because the payment method is declined or because they require customer authentication. You should build logic to handle both of these scenarios.\n\nUse the instructions for [payment failures](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/overview#requires-payment-method) to handle card declines. You need to attach a new payment method to the customer and then use the [pay](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/pay) endpoint to pay the invoice that the update generates.\n\nUse the [customer action](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/overview#requires-action) instructions to handle customer authentication. This walks the user through the authentication process and then pays the invoice.\n\nA successful payment:\n\n*   Immediately applies the changes in the `pending_update` hash.\n*   Updates the invoice to `paid`.\n\nIf payment fails again, the `pending_update` hash remains on the subscription with the original [expiry date](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/pending-updates-reference#expiration) and no changes are applied.",

  "markdown": "# Trigger webhook events with the Stripe CLI\n\n## Learn how to trigger webhook events in test mode.\n\nThere are two ways to trigger webhook events in test mode:\n\n*   Do the actions that lead to the event you want to trigger. For example, [creating a Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/create) with the Stripe API or in the Stripe Dashboard generates a `customer.created` event.\n*   Run a command with the Stripe CLI to automatically generate the event.\n\nThis guide focuses on the Stripe CLI.\n\n## Trigger events![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nTo see the name of all events supported by the Stripe CLI, run this command.\n\nTo trigger a specific event, run this by replacing `<EVENT>` with the name of the event.\n\nFor example, this command triggers the `payment_intent.succeeded` event.\n\n`stripe trigger payment_intent.succeeded`\n\nThen, you can view the event in the [events page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/events) of the Stripe Dashboard or by using the [stripe listen](https://docs.stripe.com/cli/listen) command.\n\n#### Note\n\nDepending on the event that you trigger, the Stripe CLI might generate multiple related events. For example, when running `stripe trigger price.created`, the Stripe CLI needs to create a Product to create a Price, so it generates two events: `product.created` and `price.created`.\n\n## Customize events![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nTo generate events, the Stripe CLI calls the Stripe API with some predefined parameters. For example, to trigger the `payment_intent.succeeded` event, the Stripe CLI calls the create PaymentIntent endpoint with the `amount` parameter set to `2000`. You can change these API parameters with the `override` flag.\n\n`stripe trigger <EVENT> --override <RESOURCE>:<PROPERTY>=<VALUE>`\n\nHere are some examples of using overrides.\n\n`# Set a top-level parameter stripe trigger customer.created --override customer:name=Bob  # Set a nested parameter stripe trigger customer.created --override customer:\"address[country]\"=FR  # Append an element to the end of a list stripe trigger customer.created --override customer:\"preferred_locales[]\"=FR  # Replace an element of a list stripe trigger customer.created --override customer:\"preferred_locales[0]\"=FR  # Set a parameter inside a list stripe trigger customer.subscription.created --override subscription:\"items[0][price]\"=price_xxx`\n\nYou can also combine multiple overrides on different resources.\n\n`stripe trigger price.created \\   --override product:name=foo \\   --override price:unit_amount=4200`\n\nTo figure out which resources and parameters you can change, review the relevant triggers in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-cli/tree/master/pkg/fixtures/triggers) of the Stripe CLI.\n\n## Advanced customization of events![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nIf the available events or overrides aren’t sufficient for your use case, you can write a JSON file describing how to generate an event, and use the CLI to trigger that event.

Consult your legal counsel for regional requirements. |\n| **How can I access or delete my verification data?** | Provide your data privacy process.<br><br>The Identity API has a [redaction endpoint](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_sessions/redact) that allows you to delete the verification data that Stripe Identity stores on behalf of your business.

If you’ve created additional copies of a user’s data, you might also need to delete these as well.<br><br>Stripe doesn’t delete data on your behalf when we store the data as your processor, even if your end-user asks us to, because we recognize you must conduct your own legal analysis on whether deletion is appropriate.<br><br>If your end-user reaches out to us requesting deletion, we’ll respond to the request with respect to any data that we hold as data controller, and also recommend the end-user reach out to you to request deletion. |",

  "markdown": "# Subscription invoices | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Learn how to manage subscription invoices.\n\n[Invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices \"invoices\") are core resources in Stripe, representing the amount a customer owes. Stripe generates an invoice for every period in a [subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/creating \"subscriptions\") billing cycle period. You can also manually generate invoices through the Dashboard or API for off-cycle or one-time payments. Read the guides to learn more about the lifecycle for [standalone invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/overview#invoice-lifecycle) and [subscription-generated invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/overview#invoice-lifecycle).\n\n[](#sub-invoice-lifecycle)\n\nThe following sections describe how Stripe handles an invoice throughout a subscription lifecycle.\n\n### New subscription invoices ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nWhen you subscribe a customer, Stripe:\n\n*   Creates an invoice.\n*   [Finalizes](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/workflow-transitions#finalized) the invoice.\n\nIf the payment succeeds on a subscription’s first invoice or the invoice doesn’t require payment, the invoice transitions to [status=paid](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/object#invoice_object-status), and the subscription becomes active.\n\nUntil the payment succeeds, the invoice [status](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/object#invoice_object-status) remains `open` and [auto\\_advance](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/automatic-advancement-collection#toggle-auto-advance) remains `false`. The subscription [status](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/object#subscription_object-status) remains `incomplete`. Learn how to resolve payment failures for new subscription invoices that [require a payment method](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/overview#requires-payment-method).\n\nIn some cases, upgrading or downgrading the subscription also creates a new invoice. We turn off [auto\\_advance](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/automatic-advancement-collection#toggle-auto-advance) for these invoices from the outset.\n\nWith a finalized invoice, you can’t add invoice items or make other modifications that affect the amount due. However, you can still add invoice items to the customer. The added items apply to the next invoice.\n\n### Subscription renewal invoices ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nWhen subscriptions renew, Stripe:\n\n*   Creates an invoice.\n    \n*   Leaves the invoice in a `draft` state for about an hour.\n    \n*   Attempts to finalize and pay the invoice with the default payment method.\n    \n*   Changes the invoice status to `paid` if payment succeeds.\n    \n\nWhen Stripe creates an invoice, you receive—through configured [webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/webhooks)—an `invoice.created` event. In this case, the attribute of the invoice [status](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/object#invoice_object-status) is `draft`, which means that its invoice items are open for modification.\n\n### Collect payment![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nWhen an invoice is due, Stripe tries to collect payment by either [automatically charging](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/automatic-charging) the [payment method](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/integration-options) on file, or [emailing the invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration#accept-invoice-payment) to customers.\n\n#### Retry payments![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nStripe offers several options for dealing with [failed payments](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/automatic-collection), including machine-learning powered [Smart Retries](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/automatic-collection#smart-retries).\n\n[](#manage-invoices)\n\nThe following sections describe how to perform basic actions on invoices in the Dashboard. For more options around using invoices, see [Managing invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/dashboard/manage-invoices).\n\n### Create an invoice![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nStripe automatically creates an invoice for subscriptions at the end of each billing cycle.\n\nLearn how to [create a one-off invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/dashboard#create-invoice).\n\nStripe finalizes and sends the invoice in 1 hour. Before the invoice is finalized, you can edit it. Read more about making changes in the [Invoice details page](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/dashboard/manage-invoices#invoice-details-page).\n\n### Edit an invoice![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nWith the Dashboard, you can duplicate an invoice and modify the new copy. When you duplicate an invoice, Stripe copies all of the information on the original invoice except for credit notes, deleted (or archived) products, prices, coupons, discounts, and tax rates. If you made a mistake on an invoice you already created, duplicate it, make your corrections, and then send the new invoice. Remember to [void](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/overview#void) the incorrect invoice as well.\n\n#### Note\n\nYou can change the status of an [open](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/overview#open) invoice in the Dashboard by going to its details page and choosing **More** > **Change Invoice Status**.\n\nTo duplicate an invoice, [view your invoices](https://dashboard.stripe.com/invoices) and click the overflow menu () for the invoice you want to duplicate. Click **Duplicate invoice** to create, edit, and then send the new invoice.\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/invoice-duplication.7f22a89383b54d5e45693f642942afa1.png)\n\nDuplicate an invoice from the Dashboard\n\n### Preview upcoming invoices ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nThe [Retrieve an invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/api#retrieve_invoice) API provides a mechanism for viewing an existing invoice. Stripe also provides an endpoint for [retrieving an upcoming invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/api#upcoming_invoice). This preview reflects the base price, pending invoice items, discounts, and any existing customer credit balance.\n\nWhen fetching the preview, you can also model what the invoice would look like if you changed the subscription in one of these ways:\n\n*   Swapping the underlying price.\n    \n*   Altering the quantity.\n    \n*   Applying a trial period.\n    \n*   Adding a coupon.\n    \n\n[](#update-first-invoice)\n\nHow you edit the first invoice of a subscription depends on the setting for the customer’s payment method for the subscription. If unsure, you can check the payment method setting using the API or the Dashboard.\n\nTo check subscription payment method using the API, check the value of [`collection_method`](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/object#subscription_object-collection_method) on the `Subscriptions` object for the customer. A value of `send_invoice` means Stripe emails the customer their invoice. A value of `charge_automatically` means Stripe charges the customer on your behalf using their default payment method.\n\nTo check subscription payment method in the Dashboard, open the [Subscriptions page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/subscriptions). Then, click the subscription you want to check to open it’s detailed view. In the **Subscription details** section, the **Billing method** field value defines the payment method: **Charge default payment method** or **Send invoice**.\n\nFor customers that receive invoices, you have a one hour period after creation before Stripe finalizes the subscription. Within this timeframe you can make necessary changes to the subscription, like changing amount or line items, adding a description or metadata, and so on.\n\nAfter the initial hour, you can no longer make updates. Stripe emails the invoice to the customer to collect subscription payment.\n\n[](#Customize)\n\nYou can customize invoices in several ways, including:\n\n*   [Add extra items to a future invoice](#adding-upcoming-invoice-items)\n*   [Increase the frequency of invoices](#pending-items-frequently)\n*   [Add items to a customer’s first invoice](#first-invoice-extra)\n*   [Add items to a draft subscription invoice](#adding-draft-invoice-items)\n*   [Generate an invoice outside of the subscription cycle](#generating-invoices)\n*   [Pause a subscription invoice for review](#holding-review)\n*   [Issue a subscription invoice with configurable item prices](#invoice-item-prices)\n\n### Add extra invoice items to a future invoice ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nYou can add up to 250 invoice items to an invoice. To [add extra invoice items](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoiceitems/create) to the next invoice in the cycle:\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/invoiceitems \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d price=price_CBb6IXqvTLXp3f \\  -d customer=cus_4fdAW5ftNQow1a`\n\nThese one-off items are added to the next invoice created for this customer. To make sure this is added to a specific subscription, use the optional `subscription` parameter to apply it to that subscription.\n\n#### Invoice pending items more frequently ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nOther than [changing the billing cycle](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/billing-cycle), there are a few ways to invoice these items without adjusting the normal subscription cycle:\n\n*   Create a [one-off invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/dashboard) for the customer.\n    \n*   Charge a subscription whenever the amount due reaches a [threshold](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/usage-based/pricing-models#billing-thresholds).\n    \n*   Use [pending\\_invoice\\_item\\_interval](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/object#subscription_object-pending_invoice_item_interval) to specify an interval for how often to bill for any pending invoice items. This is equivalent to having Stripe create a [one-off invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/dashboard) for the subscription on a recurring basis.\n    \n\nInclude a one-time charge to the first subscription invoice using `add_invoice_items`:\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/subscriptions \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d customer={{CUSTOMER_ID}} \\   -d \"items[0][price]\"={{RECURRING_PRICE_ID}} \\   -d \"add_invoice_items[0][price]\"={{PRICE_ID}} \\   -d payment_behavior=default_incomplete`\n\n#### Caution\n\n### Add invoice items to a draft subscription invoice ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nWhen a subscription renews and creates an invoice, Stripe sends the `invoice.created` [webhook](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks \"webhook\") event. Stripe [waits approximately one hour](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/webhooks#understand) before finalizing the invoice and attempting payment, or sending an email.\n\nDuring that delay, the invoice is a [`draft`](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/object#invoice_object-status) and is editable. You can [create invoice items](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoiceitems/create) on that invoice. Make sure to provide the [invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoiceitems/create#create_invoiceitem-invoice) parameter when you create these invoice items. Otherwise, they’re added as pending items and are included in the next subscription period.\n\nThese invoice items behave slightly differently than invoice items automatically generated by Stripe:\n\n*   Pending invoice items are always charged when the billing period ends for any canceled subscription. Canceling a customer’s subscription prevents them from being billed again _if no invoice items exist_.\n    \n*   Pending invoice items aren’t prorated when a customer’s subscription changes.\n    \n\nIf pending invoice items remain after a subscription cancels, Stripe generates an invoice and attempts to bill the customer for them at the end of the next billing period. These invoice items are (similarly) not prorated when a subscription changes.\n\n#### Manage pending invoice items ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nYou can see a customer’s pending invoice items by navigating to the [Customers page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/customers), and clicking on their name. If the customer has a pending invoice item, it appears under **Pending invoice items**. An invoice item appears as pending if it’s not attached to any invoice.\n\nUnder **Pending invoice items**, you can also choose to create a new invoice item, or instantly invoice everything listed. When you click **Invoice now**, a dialog appears that lets you select whether to charge the default source or email the invoice to the customer. Additionally, the dialog gives you the option to calculate tax automatically.\n\n### Generate an invoice for subscription items outside the billing cycle ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nYou can invoice pending invoice items outside of the regular billing cycle by [generating a one-off invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/dashboard). Generating a one-off invoice pulls in any pending invoice items that would have been added to the regularly scheduled invoice.\n\n#### Caution\n\nWhen you manually generate an invoice, Stripe does not apply the [tax rates](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/taxes) you may have established on the subscription. If taxes should apply, you must explicitly [add the tax rates](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/taxes/tax-rates) to the invoice.\n\n### Pause a subscription invoice for review ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nRather than automatically attempting payment at the end of a billing period, you can pause the invoice for review or corrections. To pause an invoice:\n\n1.  Pause automatic collection within one hour of receiving the `invoice.created` event. You can do this by setting `auto_advance=false` in the API, or by going to [Subscriptions and emails](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/automatic) in the Dashboard. Locate the pause payment section, and click **Set up** to make changes. This feature prevents Stripe from automatically attempting payment from your customer for the invoice amount, and from emailing the invoice.\n    \n2.  Review the invoice.\n    \n3.  After you’re ready to charge the customer, resume automatic collection. You can this by either setting [auto\\_advance=true](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update#update_invoice-auto_advance), or by updating the pause payment options in the Dashboard.\n    \n\n### Issue a subscription invoice with configurable item prices ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nYou can issue invoices with line item prices that exclude inclusive tax. Tax-exclusive prices are only shown in the invoice PDF. That means, when using inclusive tax, the Hosted Invoice Page and invoice emails show tax-inclusive prices. You can define the settings for net prices in the Dashboard or API.\n\n*   **Include inclusive tax**—The invoice PDF displays line item prices including the inclusive tax. (This is the default.)\n*   **Exclude tax**—The invoice PDF displays line item prices excluding tax.\n\n#### Order precedence\n\nIf you set a default for line item prices at the customer level, it takes precedence over account-level settings.\n\n[](#subscription-metadata)\n\nAfter a subscription creates an invoice, it includes the subscription’s `metadata` in the following ways:\n\n*   The invoice’s [subscription\\_details.metadata](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/object#invoice_object-subscription_details-metadata) attribute always contains the subscription’s `metadata` at the time of invoice creation, even if the subscription `metadata` is later modified.\n*   The [metadata](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoice/line_item#invoice_line_item_object-metadata) attribute of [invoice line items](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/line_item) with [type=“subscription”](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/line_item#invoice_line_item_object-type) reflects the most recent subscription `metadata` at the time of retrieving the invoice, meaning it might differ from the `metadata` at the time of invoice creation.\n*   Invoice line items with [type=“invoiceitem”](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/line_item#invoice_line_item_object-type) don’t contain the subscription’s `metadata`.\n\nWhen you modify a subscription invoice line item’s `metadata` directly, either with the [invoice line update](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_line) or the [bulk invoice line update](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/bulk-update-line-item) endpoint, the update request declares the invoice line item `metadata`. Any “inherited” Subscription `metadata` isn’t preserved implicitly.\n\n[Subscription item metadata](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/object#subscription_object-items-data-metadata) isn’t automatically propagated to any other Stripe objects.",

  "markdown": "# Subscription schedules use cases | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Learn how to use subscription schedules.\n\nTo understand [subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/creating \"subscriptions\") schedules, imagine a fictional newspaper company called The Pacific. It offers two subscription options:\n\n*   _Print_, where customers receive the physical paper\n*   _Digital_, where customers get access to exclusive content on The Pacific’s website\n\nBoth subscriptions bill monthly. Browse possible options for subscription schedules below.\n\n## Start a subscription in the future ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nBy default, new print subscriptions start on the first day of the next month. To accomplish this, the `start_date` is set to a point in the future. The code below creates a subscription that starts in the future:\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/subscription_schedules \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d customer=  {{CUSTOMER_ID}}   \\  -d start_date=1690873200 \\  -d end_behavior=release \\  -d \"phases[0][items][0][price]\"={{PRICE_PRINT}} \\   -d \"phases[0][items][0][quantity]\"=1 \\  -d \"phases[0][iterations]\"=12`\n\n## Backdate a subscription ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nWhen customers subscribe to the digital plan, The Pacific backdates their subscriptions to the first day of the current month. Backdating charges for time in the past and allows digital subscribers to access the website immediately.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/subscription_schedules \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d customer=  {{CUSTOMER_ID}}   \\  -d start_date=1688194800 \\  -d end_behavior=release \\  -d \"phases[0][items][0][price]\"={{PRICE_DIGITAL}} \\   -d \"phases[0][items][0][quantity]\"=1 \\  -d \"phases[0][iterations]\"=12`\n\n## Add a schedule to an existing subscription ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nThe Pacific may discover that some of their original customers are on subscriptions without schedules. Because these subscriptions exist already, the subscription IDs can be passed in the `from_subscription` attribute to add a schedule. Passing the subscription IDs in this way creates a schedule with one phase that’s based on the current billing period of the subscription.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/subscription_schedules \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d from_subscription=  {{SUBSCRIPTION_ID}}    `\n\nWhile adding these schedules, some customers decide to get a print subscription so The Pacific adds a second phase to the schedule to start the print plan one month from now. The following use case shows an example of this process.\n\n## Upgrade subscriptions ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nThe Pacific offers an option to start with a print subscription for one month, then automatically add the digital option. Some customers prefer this because they can test out the print publication first and then decide if they want to continue or cancel their subscription.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/subscription_schedules \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d customer=  {{CUSTOMER_ID}}   \\  -d start_date=now \\  -d end_behavior=release \\  -d \"phases[0][items][0][price]\"={{PRICE_PRINT}} \\   -d \"phases[0][items][0][quantity]\"=1 \\  -d \"phases[0][iterations]\"=1 \\  -d \"phases[1][items][0][price]\"={{PRICE_PRINT}} \\   -d \"phases[1][items][0][quantity]\"=1 \\  -d \"phases[1][items][1][price]\"={{PRICE_DIGITAL}} \\   -d \"phases[1][items][1][quantity]\"=1 \\  -d \"phases[1][iterations]\"=11`\n\n## Downgrade subscriptions ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nThe Pacific also offers an option to start a subscription with both the print and digital publications, and then downgrade to only the print publication for the rest of the subscription. [Customers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers \"Customers\") use this option to test out both publications to see how they like them.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/subscription_schedules \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d customer=  {{CUSTOMER_ID}}   \\  -d start_date=now \\  -d end_behavior=release \\  -d \"phases[0][items][0][price]\"={{PRICE_DIGITAL}} \\   -d \"phases[0][items][0][quantity]\"=1 \\  -d \"phases[0][items][1][price]\"={{PRICE_PRINT}} \\   -d \"phases[0][items][1][quantity]\"=1 \\  -d \"phases[0][iterations]\"=1 \\  -d \"phases[1][items][0][price]\"={{PRICE_PRINT}} \\   -d \"phases[1][items][0][quantity]\"=1 \\  -d \"phases[1][iterations]\"=11`\n\n## Change subscriptions ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nThe Pacific offers two print subscription options, a basic option with advertisements or a premium option without advertisements. Some customers on the premium option decide they want to change to the basic option with advertisements at the next billing cycle. Create a schedule using the existing subscription and then update the schedule with the basic option with advertisements as a new phase.\n\n`# Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production. # See your keys here: [https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys) Stripe.api_key =` \n\n`'sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc'`\n\n`# Create a subscription schedule with the existing subscription schedule = Stripe::SubscriptionSchedule.create({   from_subscription: 'sub_ERf72J8Sc7qx7D', })  # Update the schedule with the new phase Stripe::SubscriptionSchedule.update(   schedule.id,   {     phases: [       {         items: [           {             price: schedule.phases[0].items[0].price,             quantity: schedule.phases[0].items[0].quantity,           },         ],         start_date: schedule.phases[0].start_date,         end_date: schedule.phases[0].end_date,       },       {         items: [           {             price: '{{PRICE_PRINT_BASIC}}',             quantity: 1,           },         ],         iterations: 1,       },     ],   }, )`\n\n## Increase the quantity ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nYou can also schedule increases to the quantities on a subscription. The schedule below starts with one instance of the digital publication for one month. In the second phase, the quantity is increased to 2 for 11 more months.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/subscription_schedules \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d customer=  {{CUSTOMER_ID}}   \\  -d start_date=now \\  -d end_behavior=release \\  -d \"phases[0][items][0][price]\"=  {{PRICE_ID}}   \\  -d \"phases[0][items][0][quantity]\"=1 \\  -d \"phases[0][iterations]\"=1 \\  -d \"phases[1][items][0][price]\"=  {{PRICE_ID}}   \\  -d \"phases[1][items][0][quantity]\"=2 \\  -d \"phases[1][iterations]\"=11`\n\n## Use coupons ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nSometimes The Pacific runs subscription specials. The schedule below starts the customer on the print publication at 50% off for six months. The schedule removes the coupon from the subscription in the second phase, which entails the remaining six months.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/subscription_schedules \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d customer=  {{CUSTOMER_ID}}   \\  -d start_date=now \\  -d end_behavior=release \\  -d \"phases[0][items][0][price]\"=  {{PRICE_ID}}   \\  -d \"phases[0][items][0][quantity]\"=1 \\  -d \"phases[0][iterations]\"=6 \\  -d \"phases[0][coupon]\"=  {{COUPON_ID}}   \\  -d \"phases[1][items][0][price]\"=  {{PRICE_ID}}   \\  -d \"phases[1][items][0][quantity]\"=1 \\  -d \"phases[1][iterations]\"=6`\n\n## Change tax rates ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nThe Pacific operates in several jurisdictions, and some of them have unique tax rates for subscription based businesses. One of these jurisdictions requires two tax rates: one for the first month when a customer initially subscribes, and one for recurring billings.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/subscription_schedules \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d customer=  {{CUSTOMER_ID}}   \\  -d start_date=now \\  -d end_behavior=release \\  -d \"phases[0][items][0][price]\"=  {{PRICE_ID}}   \\  -d \"phases[0][items][0][quantity]\"=1 \\  -d \"phases[0][items][0][tax_rates][0]\"=txr_2J8lmBBGHJYyuUJqF6QJtaAA \\  -d \"phases[0][iterations]\"=1 \\  -d \"phases[1][items][0][price]\"=  {{PRICE_ID}}   \\  -d \"phases[1][items][0][quantity]\"=1 \\  -d \"phases[1][items][0][tax_rates][0]\"=txr_2J8lmBBGHJYyuUJqF6QJtbBB \\  -d \"phases[1][iterations]\"=11`\n\n## Release a subscription from a schedule ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nYou can [release](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscription_schedules/release) a subscription from a schedule as long as the status of the schedule is `not_started` or `active`. Releasing a subscription leaves it in place but removes the schedule and any remaining phases.\n\n`curl -X POST https://api.stripe.com/v1/subscription_schedules/`\n\n`{{SUBSCRIPTION_SCHEDULE_ID}}`\n\n`/release \\  -u \"  sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc  :\"`\n\n## Cancel a schedule and subscription ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nYou can cancel a subscription schedule and its associated subscription immediately (if the subscription schedule has an active subscription). A subscription schedule can only be canceled if its status is `not_started` or `active`.\n\n`curl -X POST https://api.stripe.com/v1/subscription_schedules/`\n\n`{{SUBSCRIPTION_SCHEDULE_ID}}`\n\n`/cancel \\  -u \"  sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc  :\"`\n\n## Reset the billing cycle anchor ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nThe Pacific bills their long-time print customers on whichever day of the month they originally subscribed. This day is their billing cycle anchor.\n\nIf these customers transition to the digital edition, The Pacific schedules their transition date for the 1st day of the following month. They also reset the billing cycle anchor to that same date.\n\nYou can verify that the billing cycle anchor gets reset by creating a subscription using the sample code below. Look at the subscription in the Dashboard, and notice that the Upcoming [Invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices \"invoices\") is scheduled to bill the customer as soon as the digital subscription starts on the 1st.\n\nTo see what happens if you don’t reset the anchor, run the sample code again, but remove the line that sets the billing cycle anchor to `phase_start`. Without that line, the Upcoming Invoice in the Dashboard waits to bill the customer until a full month from today, despite the transition that occurs on the 1st.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/subscription_schedules \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d customer=  {{CUSTOMER_ID}}   \\  -d start_date=now \\  -d \"phases[0][items][0][price]\"={{PRICE_PRINT}} \\   -d \"phases[0][items][0][quantity]\"=1 \\  -d \"phases[0][end_date]\"=1690873200 \\  -d \"phases[1][items][0][price]\"={{PRICE_DIGITAL}} \\   -d \"phases[1][items][0][quantity]\"=1 \\  -d \"phases[1][iterations]\"=11 \\  -d \"phases[1][billing_cycle_anchor]\"=phase_start`\n\n## Installment plans ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nInstallment plans allow customers to make partial payments for a set amount of time until the total amount is paid. For example, when The Pacific buys new printing presses, they sell the used ones to other publications. Smaller publications rarely have enough funds to pay for a printing press upfront, so they pay using an installment plan instead.\n\nFor most presses, The Pacific charges 1,000 USD per month so a reusable price is created:\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/prices \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d unit_amount=100000 \\  -d currency=usd \\  -d product=prod_Hh99apo1OViyGW \\  -d \"recurring[interval]\"=month`\n\nDepending on the make, model, and age of the printing press, The Pacific charges different amounts. This example charges 1,000 USD each month for 6 months, for a total of 6,000 USD.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/subscription_schedules \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d customer=  {{CUSTOMER_ID}}   \\  -d start_date=now \\  -d end_behavior=cancel \\  -d \"phases[0][items][0][price]\"=  {{PRICE_ID}}   \\  -d \"phases[0][items][0][quantity]\"=1 \\  -d \"phases[0][iterations]\"=6`\n\nThe number of `iterations` is multiplied by the price’s interval—6 monthly payments in this example—to determine the number of times the customer is charged. `end_behavior` determines what happens to the subscription after the last iteration is complete. In an installment plan, the subscription isn’t needed anymore so `end_behavior` is set to `cancel`.\n\nIn rare cases, The Pacific charges less than the usual 1,000 USD per month. In these scenarios, they use `price_data` to create a single-use price. This example creates a 500 USD price, and charges monthly for 6 months:\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/subscription_schedules \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d customer=  {{CUSTOMER_ID}}   \\  -d start_date=now \\  -d end_behavior=cancel \\  -d \"phases[0][items][0][price_data][currency]\"=usd \\  -d \"phases[0][items][0][price_data][product]\"=prod_Hh99apo1OViyGW \\  -d \"phases[0][items][0][price_data][recurring][interval]\"=month \\  -d \"phases[0][items][0][price_data][unit_amount]\"=50000 \\  -d \"phases[0][items][0][quantity]\"=1 \\  -d \"phases[0][iterations]\"=6`",

  "markdown": "# Release a schedule | Stripe API Reference\n\nReleases the subscription schedule immediately, which will stop scheduling of its phases, but leave any existing subscription in place. A schedule can only be released if its status is `not_started` or `active`. If the subscription schedule is currently associated with a subscription, releasing it will remove its `subscription` property and set the subscription’s ID to the `released_subscription` property.\n\n### Parameters\n\nNo parameters.\n\n### More parameters\n\n*   #### \n    \n    preserve\\_cancel\\_dateboolean\n    \n\n### Returns\n\nThe released `subscription_schedule` object.

Do not save AccountSessions to your database as they expire relatively quickly, and cannot be used more than once.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect embedded components](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-connect-embedded-components)\n\n## [Application Fees](https://docs.stripe.com/api/application_fees)\n\nWhen you collect a transaction fee on top of a charge made for your user (using [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)), an `Application Fee` object is created in your account. You can list, retrieve, and refund application fees.\n\nRelated guide: [Collecting application fees](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges#collect-fees)\n\n## [Country Specs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/country_specs)\n\nStripe needs to collect certain pieces of information about each account created. These requirements can differ depending on the account’s country. The Country Specs API makes these rules available to your integration.\n\nYou can also view the information from this API call as [an online guide](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information).\n\n## [Person](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/create)[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/update)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/retrieve)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/list)[DELETE/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/delete)\n\n## [Transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/transfers)\n\nA `Transfer` object is created when you move funds between Stripe accounts as part of Connect.\n\nBefore April 6, 2017, transfers also represented movement of funds from a Stripe account to a card or bank account. This behavior has since been split out into a [Payout](#payout_object) object, with corresponding payout endpoints. For more information, read about the [transfer/payout split](https://docs.stripe.com/transfer-payout-split).\n\nRelated guide: [Creating separate charges and transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n\n## [Secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/secret_management)\n\nSecret Store is an API that allows Stripe Apps developers to securely persist secrets for use by UI Extensions and app backends.\n\nThe primary resource in Secret Store is a `secret`. Other apps can’t view secrets created by an app. Additionally, secrets are scoped to provide further permission control.\n\nAll Dashboard users and the app backend share `account` scoped secrets. Use the `account` scope for secrets that don’t change per-user, like a third-party API key.\n\nA `user` scoped secret is accessible by the app backend and one specific Dashboard user. Use the `user` scope for per-user secrets like per-user OAuth tokens, where different users might have different permissions.\n\nRelated guide: [Store data between page reloads](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/store-auth-data-custom-objects)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[GET/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/list)[POST/v1/apps/secrets/delete](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/delete)[GET/v1/apps/secrets/find](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/find)[POST/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/set)\n\n## [Reviews](https://docs.stripe.com/api/radar/reviews)\n\nReviews can be used to supplement automated fraud detection with human expertise.\n\nLearn more about [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar) and reviewing payments [here](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/reviews).\n\n## [Authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/update)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/list)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/approve](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/approve)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/decline](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/decline)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_create)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/capture](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_capture)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/expire](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_expire)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/finalize\\_amount](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_finalize_amount)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/increment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_increment)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/fraud\\_challenges/respond](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/respond_to_fraud_challenges)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/reverse](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_reverse)\n\n## [Cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/create)[POST/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/update)[GET/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/list)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/deliver](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_deliver)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/fail](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_fail)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/return](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_return)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/ship](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_ship)\n\n## [Physical Bundles](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/physical_bundles)\n\nA Physical Bundle represents the bundle of physical items - card stock, carrier letter, and envelope - that is shipped to a cardholder when you create a physical card.\n\n## [Reader](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/terminal/readers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/create)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/update)[GET/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/retrieve)[GET/v1/terminal/readers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/list)[DELETE/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/delete)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/cancel\\_action](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/cancel_action)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/collect\\_inputs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/collect_inputs)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/confirm\\_payment\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/confirm_payment_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/collect\\_payment\\_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/collect_payment_method)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/process\\_payment\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/process_payment_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/process\\_setup\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/process_setup_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/refund\\_payment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/refund_payment)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/set\\_reader\\_display](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/set_reader_display)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/terminal/readers/:id/present\\_payment\\_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/present_payment_method)\n\n## [Terminal Hardware Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_products)Preview feature\n\nA TerminalHardwareProduct is a category of hardware devices that are generally similar, but may have variations depending on the country it’s shipped to.\n\nTerminalHardwareSKUs represent variations within the same Product (for example, a country specific device). For example, WisePOS E is a TerminalHardwareProduct and a WisePOS E - US and WisePOS E - UK are TerminalHardwareSKUs.\n\n## [Terminal Hardware SKU](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_skus)Preview feature\n\nA TerminalHardwareSKU represents a SKU for Terminal hardware. A SKU is a representation of a product available for purchase, containing information such as the name, price, and images.\n\n## [Transaction Entries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/transaction_entries)\n\nTransactionEntries represent individual units of money movements within a single [Transaction](#transactions).\n\n## [Scheduled Queries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/sigma/scheduled_queries)\n\nIf you have [scheduled a Sigma query](https://docs.stripe.com/sigma/scheduled-queries), you’ll receive a `sigma.scheduled_query_run.created` webhook each time the query runs. The webhook contains a `ScheduledQueryRun` object, which you can use to retrieve the query results.\n\n## [Report Types](https://docs.stripe.com/api/reporting/report_type)\n\nThe Report Type resource corresponds to a particular type of report, such as the “Activity summary” or “Itemized payouts” reports. These objects are identified by an ID belonging to a set of enumerated values. See [API Access to Reports documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/reporting/statements/api) for those Report Type IDs, along with required and optional parameters.\n\nNote that certain report types can only be run based on your live-mode data (not test-mode data), and will error when queried without a [live-mode API key](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#test-live-modes).\n\n## [Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/financial_connections/sessions)\n\nA Financial Connections Session is the secure way to programmatically launch the client-side Stripe.js modal that lets your users link their accounts.\n\n## [Verification Report](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_reports)\n\nA VerificationReport is the result of an attempt to collect and verify data from a user. The collection of verification checks performed is determined from the `type` and `options` parameters used. You can find the result of each verification check performed in the appropriate sub-resource: `document`, `id_number`, `selfie`.\n\nEach VerificationReport contains a copy of any data collected by the user as well as reference IDs which can be used to access collected images through the [FileUpload](https://docs.stripe.com/api/files) API. To configure and create VerificationReports, use the [VerificationSession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_sessions) API.\n\nRelated guide: [Accessing verification results](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verification-sessions#results).\n\n## [Crypto Onramp Quotes](https://docs.stripe.com/api/crypto/onramp_quotes)\n\nCrypto Onramp Quotes are estimated quotes for onramp conversions into all the different cryptocurrencies on different networks. The Quotes API allows you to display quotes in your product UI before directing the user to the onramp widget.\n\nRelated guide: [Quotes API](https://docs.stripe.com/crypto/quotes-api)\n\n## [Climate Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/climate/product)\n\nA Climate product represents a type of carbon removal unit available for reservation. You can retrieve it to see the current price and availability.\n\n## [Forwarding Request](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/request)\n\nInstructs Stripe to make a request on your behalf using the destination URL. The destination URL is activated by Stripe at the time of onboarding. Stripe verifies requests with your credentials provided during onboarding, and injects card details from the payment\\_method into the request.\n\nStripe redacts all sensitive fields and headers, including authentication credentials and card numbers, before storing the request and response data in the forwarding Request object, which are subject to a 30-day retention period.\n\nYou can provide a Stripe idempotency key to make sure that requests with the same key result in only one outbound request. The Stripe idempotency key provided should be unique and different from any idempotency keys provided on the underlying third-party request.\n\nForwarding Requests are synchronous requests that return a response or time out according to Stripe’s limits.\n\nRelated guide: [Forward card details to third-party API endpoints](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/forwarding).\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/create)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/retrieve)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/list)",

Raises [an error](#errors) otherwise.\n\nThe invoice object contains a `lines` hash that contains information about the subscriptions and invoice items that have been applied to the invoice, as well as any prorations that Stripe has automatically calculated. Each line on the invoice has an `amount` attribute that represents the amount actually contributed to the invoice’s total. For invoice items and prorations, the amount attribute is the same as for the invoice item or proration respectively. For subscriptions, the amount may be different from the plan’s regular price depending on whether the invoice covers a trial period or the invoice period differs from the plan’s usual interval.\n\nThe invoice object has both a `subtotal` and a `total`. The subtotal represents the total before any discounts, while the total is the final amount to be charged to the customer after all coupons have been applied.\n\nThe invoice also has a `next_payment_attempt` attribute that tells you the next time (as a Unix timestamp) payment for the invoice will be automatically attempted. For invoices with manual payment collection, that have been closed, or that have reached the maximum number of retries (specified in your [subscriptions settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/billing/automatic)), the `next_payment_attempt` will be null.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/invoices/in_1MtHbELkdIwHu7ixl4OzzPMv \\  -u \"sk_test_4eC39Hq...arjtT1zdp7dcsk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc:\"\n```\n\n```\n{  \"id\": \"in_1MtHbELkdIwHu7ixl4OzzPMv\",  \"object\": \"invoice\",  \"account_country\": \"US\",  \"account_name\": \"Stripe Docs\",  \"account_tax_ids\": null,  \"amount_due\": 0,  \"amount_paid\": 0,  \"amount_remaining\": 0,  \"amount_shipping\": 0,  \"application\": null,  \"application_fee_amount\": null,  \"attempt_count\": 0,  \"attempted\": false,  \"auto_advance\": false,  \"automatic_tax\": {    \"enabled\": false,    \"liability\": null,    \"status\": null  },  \"billing_reason\": \"manual\",  \"charge\": null,  \"collection_method\": \"charge_automatically\",  \"created\": 1680644467,  \"currency\": \"usd\",  \"custom_fields\": null,  \"customer\": \"cus_NeZwdNtLEOXuvB\",  \"customer_address\": null,  \"customer_email\": \"jennyrosen@example.com\",  \"customer_name\": \"Jenny Rosen\",  \"customer_phone\": null,  \"customer_shipping\": null,  \"customer_tax_exempt\": \"none\",  \"customer_tax_ids\": [],  \"default_payment_method\": null,  \"default_source\": null,  \"default_tax_rates\": [],  \"description\": null,  \"discount\": null,  \"discounts\": [],  \"due_date\": null,  \"ending_balance\": null,  \"footer\": null,  \"from_invoice\": null,  \"hosted_invoice_url\": null,  \"invoice_pdf\": null,  \"issuer\": {    \"type\": \"self\"  },  \"last_finalization_error\": null,  \"latest_revision\": null,  \"lines\": {    \"object\": \"list\",    \"data\": [],    \"has_more\": false,    \"total_count\": 0,    \"url\": \"/v1/invoices/in_1MtHbELkdIwHu7ixl4OzzPMv/lines\"  },  \"livemode\": false,  \"metadata\": {},  \"next_payment_attempt\": null,  \"number\": null,  \"on_behalf_of\": null,  \"paid\": false,  \"paid_out_of_band\": false,  \"payment_intent\": null,  \"payment_settings\": {    \"default_mandate\": null,    \"payment_method_options\": null,    \"payment_method_types\": null  },  \"period_end\": 1680644467,  \"period_start\": 1680644467,  \"post_payment_credit_notes_amount\": 0,  \"pre_payment_credit_notes_amount\": 0,  \"quote\": null,  \"receipt_number\": null,  \"rendering_options\": null,  \"shipping_cost\": null,  \"shipping_details\": null,  \"starting_balance\": 0,  \"statement_descriptor\": null,  \"status\": \"draft\",  \"status_transitions\": {    \"finalized_at\": null,    \"marked_uncollectible_at\": null,    \"paid_at\": null,    \"voided_at\": null  },  \"subscription\": null,  \"subtotal\": 0,  \"subtotal_excluding_tax\": 0,  \"tax\": null,  \"test_clock\": null,  \"total\": 0,  \"total_discount_amounts\": [],  \"total_excluding_tax\": 0,  \"total_tax_amounts\": [],  \"transfer_data\": null,  \"webhooks_delivered_at\": 1680644467}\n```\n\n## [Retrieve an upcoming invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming)\n\nAt any time, you can preview the upcoming invoice for a customer. This will show you all the charges that are pending, including subscription renewal charges, invoice item charges, etc. It will also show you any discounts that are applicable to the invoice.\n\nNote that when you are viewing an upcoming invoice, you are simply viewing a preview – the invoice has not yet been created. As such, the upcoming invoice will not show up in invoice listing calls, and you cannot use the API to pay or edit the invoice. If you want to change the amount that your customer will be billed, you can add, remove, or update pending invoice items, or update the customer’s discount.\n\nYou can preview the effects of updating a subscription, including a preview of what proration will take place. To ensure that the actual proration is calculated exactly the same as the previewed proration, you should pass the `subscription_details.proration_date` parameter when doing the actual subscription update. The recommended way to get only the prorations being previewed is to consider only proration line items where `period[start]` is equal to the `subscription_details.proration_date` value passed in the request.\n\nNote: Currency conversion calculations use the latest exchange rates. Exchange rates may vary between the time of the preview and the time of the actual invoice creation. [Learn more](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies/conversions)\n\n### Parameters\n\n*   The identifier of the customer whose upcoming invoice you’d like to retrieve. If `automatic_tax` is enabled then one of `customer`, `customer_details`, `subscription`, or `schedule` must be set.\n    \n*   The identifier of the subscription for which you’d like to retrieve the upcoming invoice. If not provided, but a `subscription_details.items` is provided, you will preview creating a subscription with those items. If neither `subscription` nor `subscription_details.items` is provided, you will retrieve the next upcoming invoice from among the customer’s subscriptions.\n    \n\n### More parameters\n\n*   #### \n    \n    discountsarray of objects\n    \n*   #### \n    \n    invoice\\_itemsarray of objects\n    \n\n*   #### \n    \n    on\\_behalf\\_ofstringConnect only\n    \n\n*   #### \n    \n    subscription\\_billing\\_cycle\\_anchorstring | timestampDeprecated\n    \n*   #### \n    \n    subscription\\_cancel\\_attimestampDeprecated\n    \n*   #### \n    \n    subscription\\_cancel\\_at\\_period\\_endbooleanDeprecated\n    \n*   #### \n    \n    subscription\\_cancel\\_nowbooleanDeprecated\n    \n*   #### \n    \n    subscription\\_default\\_tax\\_ratesarray of stringsDeprecated\n    \n*   #### \n    \n    subscription\\_detailsobject\n    \n*   #### \n    \n    subscription\\_itemsarray of objectsDeprecated\n    \n*   #### \n    \n    subscription\\_proration\\_behaviorenumDeprecated\n    \n*   #### \n    \n    subscription\\_proration\\_datetimestampDeprecated\n    \n*   #### \n    \n    subscription\\_resume\\_atstringDeprecated\n    \n*   #### \n    \n    subscription\\_start\\_datetimestampDeprecated\n    \n*   #### \n    \n    subscription\\_trial\\_endstring | timestampDeprecated\n    \n\n### Returns\n\nReturns an invoice if valid customer information is provided.

Provide the `price` and, optionally, a `quantity` (when using a value other than 1), for each product:\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/subscriptions \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d customer=  {{CUSTOMER_ID}}   \\  -d \"items[0][price]\"=price_CBXbz9i7AIOTzr \\  -d \"items[1][price]\"=price_IFuCu48Snc02bc \\  -d \"items[1][quantity]\"=2`\n\nThe response includes a list of all the subscription items, prices, and quantities:\n\n`{   \"id\": \"sub_CZEpS1Zt9QLxdo\",   \"object\": \"subscription\",   ...   \"items\": {     \"object\": \"list\",     \"data\": [       {         \"id\": \"si_H1yPnAVzP9vDRW\",         \"object\": \"subscription_item\",         \"billing_thresholds\": null,         \"created\": 1585939321,         \"metadata\": {         },         \"price\": {           \"id\": \"price_H1c8v1liEvrfcd\",           \"object\": \"price\",           \"active\": true,           \"billing_scheme\": \"per_unit\",           \"created\": 1585856460,           \"currency\": \"usd\",           \"livemode\": false,           \"lookup_key\": null,           \"metadata\": {           },           \"nickname\": null,           \"product\": \"prod_H1c7exjJHbC4sr\",           \"recurring\": {             \"aggregate_usage\": null,             \"interval\": \"month\",             \"interval_count\": 1,             \"trial_period_days\": null,             \"usage_type\": \"licensed\"           },           \"tiers\": null,           \"tiers_mode\": null,           \"transform_quantity\": null,           \"type\": \"recurring\",           \"unit_amount\": 1000,           \"unit_amount_decimal\": \"1000\"         },         \"quantity\": 1,         \"subscription\": \"sub_H1yPRslJXa4TUt\",         \"tax_rates\": [         ]`\n\n## Billing periods with multiple prices![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nConventional prices that charge a fixed amount on an interval are billed at the start of each [billing cycle](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/billing-cycle). With each invoice, the customer effectively pays for the next interval of service. With [metered billing](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/pricing-models#usage-based-pricing), the amount paid by the customer varies based on consumption during the billing cycle, so the customer pays for their usage at the end.\n\nWhen a subscription combines a fixed rate with metered billing, metered usage from the previous billing cycle is charged alongside the fixed rate for the new billing cycle at the start of each interval. The metered billing and fixed rate are combined in a single invoice.\n\n## Restrictions ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nSince using multiple products with a subscription results in a single invoice and payment, all of the prices for those products must use the same currency and have the same billing interval. You are also limited to 20 products in a single subscription.\n\n## Discounts, taxes, and trial periods ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nWhen using multiple products, you can also create discounts, charge taxes, and use trial periods as you would with a single-product subscription. Provide these as top-level arguments to the create or update subscription call, as they apply to the subscription at large:\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/subscriptions \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d customer=  {{CUSTOMER_ID}}   \\  -d coupon=free-period \\  -d \"default_tax_rates[0]\"=txr_1EO66sClCIKljWvs98IiVfHW \\  -d trial_end=1610403705 \\  -d \"items[0][price]\"=price_CBXbz9i7AIOTzr \\  -d \"items[1][price]\"=price_IFuCu48Snc02bc \\  -d \"items[1][quantity]\"=2`\n\nWhen you create a subscription by passing prices into the `items` attribute, it will ignore any trial period that is specified on the individual prices. The trial period is only respected if you create a subscription with a single price using the legacy plan attribute.\n\n## Multiple subscriptions for a customer![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYou can simultaneously create multiple subscriptions for a single customer. This capability is useful when you want to make it possible for your customers to subscribe to multiple products with separate intervals. Each subscription has its own separate billing cycle, invoice, and charge—even if the underlying prices have the same billing interval.\n\nCreate multiple subscriptions on a customer by using the same [create subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/api#create_subscription) code:\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/subscriptions \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d customer=cus_4fdAW5ftNQow1a \\  -d \"items[0][price]\"=price_CZB2krKbBDOkTS`\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/subscriptions \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d customer=cus_4fdAW5ftNQow1a \\  -d \"items[0][price]\"=price_CZB1AX3KOacNJw`\n\nA customer can be subscribed to multiple products or even to a single product multiple times. Each subscription has a unique ID and its state is handled independently from the customer’s other subscriptions. Each subscription also has its own independent billing cycle, based on the [billing cycle anchor](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/billing-cycle) of the subscription.\n\nWhen a customer has multiple subscriptions, the `Customer` object’s `subscriptions` property provides a list of every subscription:\n\n`{   \"id\": \"cus_4fdAW5ftNQow1a\",   \"object\": \"customer\",   \"subscriptions\": {     \"object\": \"list\",     \"data\": [       {         \"id\": \"sub_9RRl3XywPg2P5H\",         \"object\": \"subscription\",         ...         \"price\": {           \"id\": \"price_CZB2krKbBDOkTS\",           \"object\": \"price\",           \"amount\": 2995,           ...         }       },       {         \"id\": \"sub_9RRlIq2t9obFLI\",         \"object\": \"subscription\",         ...         \"price\": {           \"id\": \"price_CZB1AX3KOacNJw\",           \"object\": \"price\",           \"amount\": 1295,           ...         }       }     ]     ...   }   ... }`",

  "markdown": "# Setting subscription quantities | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Vary the cost of a subscription by subscribing a customer to multiple quantities of a product.\n\nBy default, each subscription is for one product, but Stripe allows you to subscribe a customer to multiple quantities of an item. For example, say you run a hosting company and your customers host sites through it at a cost of 9.99 USD per site, per month. Most customers host a single site, while some host many. You could create prices for one site (9.99 USD), two sites (19.98 USD), and so forth, but a better approach is to subscribe customers to a quantity with a 9.99 USD unit price.\n\nSubscriptions have two kinds of usage-based billing: metered billing, and per-seat licensing. You can enable these billing models by setting the value of the `recurring[usage_type]` attribute when creating a price. You can only specify a quantity when creating a subscription with a `recurring[usage_type]` of `licensed`. If you want to have granular billing for usage that fluctuates within a billing interval, consider using [metered billing](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/pricing-models#usage-based-pricing) instead of quantities.\n\n## Setting multiple quantities ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nTo set the quantity on a subscription, provide a `quantity` value when [creating](https://docs.stripe.com/api#create_subscription) or [updating](https://docs.stripe.com/api#update_subscription) the subscription:\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/subscriptions \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d customer=cus_4fdAW5ftNQow1a \\  -d \"items[0][price]\"=price_CBb6IXqvTLXp3f \\  -d \"items[0][quantity]\"=5`\n\nYou still bill multiple quantities using one [invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices \"invoices\"), and you [prorate](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/prorations) them when the subscription changes. This includes when you change subscription quantities.\n\n## Charging different amounts based on quantity![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nIn some cases, you might want to adjust the cost per seat based on the number of seats in a subscription. For example, you could offer volume licensing discounts for subscriptions that exceed certain quantity thresholds. You can use [tiers](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/pricing-models#tiered-pricing) to adjust per-seat pricing.\n\n## Quantity transformation![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nWhen you bill your customers, you might want to track usage at a different granularity than you bill. For example, consider a productivity software suite that charges 10 USD for every 5 users (or portion thereof) using the product. Without quantity transformation, they would need to increase the `quantity` of the subscription item by 1 for every 5 users.\n\n| Number of Users | Subscription Item Quantity Reported to Stripe | Total |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1   | 1   | 10 USD |\n| 3   | 1   | 10 USD |\n| 5   | 1   | 10 USD |\n| 6   | 2   | 20 USD |\n| 7   | 2   | 20 USD |\n\nWith the `transform_quantity` parameter, you can instruct Stripe to transform the quantity before applying the per unit cost. The following subscription allows you to naturally report the current number of users as the subscription item `quantity`—Stripe’s billing system divides the quantity by 5 and rounds up before calculating by the unit cost.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/prices \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d nickname=\"Standard Cost Per 5 Users\" \\  -d \"transform_quantity[divide_by]\"=5 \\  -d \"transform_quantity[round]\"=up \\  -d unit_amount=1000 \\  -d currency=usd \\  -d \"recurring[interval]\"=month \\  -d \"recurring[usage_type]\"=licensed \\  -d product={{PRODUCTIVITY_SUITE_ID}}`\n\nCurrently, the only available transformation is division, using the `divide_by` parameter in conjunction with the `round` parameter.\n\nYou can only use `transform_quantity` with `billing_scheme=per_unit`—it’s incompatible with tiered pricing.\n\n### Rounding![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe previous example showed a subscription that charges for every 5 users rounding up, that is, 6 divided by 5 results in a quantity of 2. For use cases where you don’t want to charge for a portion of usage, like charging for every full gigabyte of usage of a broadband internet service, you can also pass `down` as the value of `round`.\n\n### Metered usage![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYou can also apply `transform_quantity` in conjunction with metered billing. This transformation applies to prices with `recurring[usage_type]=metered` at the end of a billing period in the same way it applies to `quantity` for prices with `recurring[usage_type]=licensed`.\n\nA marketing email service that creates a metered price to charge 0.10 USD for every full 1000 emails sent might look something like this:\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/prices \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d nickname=\"Metered Emails\" \\  -d \"transform_quantity[divide_by]\"=1000 \\  -d \"transform_quantity[round]\"=down \\  -d unit_amount=10 \\  -d currency=usd \\  -d \"recurring[interval]\"=month \\  -d \"recurring[usage_type]\"=metered \\  -d product={{MARKETING_EMAILS_ID}}`\n\nWith this subscription, usage can be reported per email and you can bill the customer 0.10 USD for every 1000 emails they send.",

  "markdown": "# Backdating subscriptions | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Learn about backdating subscriptions.\n\nYou can backdate a subscription to bill customers for time that has already elapsed. This is often used when migrating to Stripe or for record keeping purposes. The `backdate_start_date` field specifies the subscription’s backdated start date. You can optionally bill customers for this elapsed time and set the next billing date.\n\n## Backdating and charging users ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nSometimes users can have access to your service before you create a subscription for them, and you want to charge them for that access.\n\nTo charge users for this time through the Dashboard:\n\n1.  Go to the **Payments** > **Subscriptions** page.\n    \n2.  Click **+Create subscription**.\n    \n3.  Find or add a customer.\n    \n4.  Enter the pricing and product information.\n    \n5.  In the **Subscription details** section, select the start and end dates of the subscription. To backdate it, select a start date in the past.\n    \n6.  Select the date that you want to start the billing cycle on.\n    \n7.  Optionally, set the **Payment** or **Advanced** options.\n    \n8.  Click **Create subscription**. The subscription starts on the date you selected.\n    \n\nThat creates an [invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices \"invoices\") with a prorated amount for the time between the backdated start date and the current time. The prorated amount is calculated based on an imagined interval that starts on the backdated start date. For example, if the billing interval is monthly on the first of the month, and you set the `backdate_start_date` to February 15 (in a non-leap year), the proration calculation is based on a month running February 15 to March 15. Because that imagined month is 28 days, the prorated amount for the 14 days of February 15 to March 1 is exactly half the amount of a normal monthly charge.\n\nSimilarly, if you set the `backdate_start_date` to January 15, the proration calculation is based on an imagined month running January 15 to February 15. Because that month is 31 days, the prorated amount for the 17 days of January 15 to February 1 is 17/31 (or 0.548) of a normal monthly charge.\n\nAnother way to think about the calculation is to look at the backdated start date as the original start date and the beginning of the first full billing period as an updated start date.\n\n## Backdating without charging users ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nYou can also backdate a subscription without charging the customer for the backdated period, which is useful if you’re migrating to Stripe. To do so, pass `proration_behavior: 'none'` when you create the subscription. That sets the `start_date` to the same value as `backdate_start_date`, but it doesn’t charge the customer for backdated time.\n\n## Backdating and setting the billing cycle anchor ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nYou can combine `backdate_start_date` with `billing_cycle_anchor` to backdate a subscription and set the billing cycle anchor to a date in the future. This creates a prorated item on the next invoice for the time between the backdated start date and the billing cycle anchor. That’s useful if you’re migrating to Stripe and need to carry over the next billing date for your subscriptions while billing customers for elapsed time.\n\nFor example, let’s say it’s October 15 and you’re migrating to Stripe. You have a subscription that started on September 1, and the next billing date is November 1. To migrate that subscription, create a new subscription and set `backdate_start_date` to September 1 and `billing_cycle_anchor` to November 1.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/subscriptions \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d customer=  {{CUSTOMER_ID}}   \\  -d backdate_start_date=1575176400 \\  -d billing_cycle_anchor=1572580800 \\  -d \"items[0][price]\"=  {{PRICE_ID}}    `\n\nThat immediately issues an invoice for the prorated amount covering the time between September 1 and November 1. It also sets the `start_date` of the subscription to September 1. Stripe issues the next invoice on November 1.\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/backdate-with-billing-cycle-anchor-invoice.4720d0bcbf068b1b4463e17181ba1c13.png)\n\n## Backdating an update ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nTo set the effective date of [prorations](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/prorations) when updating a subscription, use the [`proration_date`](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/update#update_subscription-proration_date) parameter. Pass an integer Unix timestamp within the subscription’s current period. If the subscription is backed by a subscription schedule, make sure that the timestamp is prior to the start date of the next phase of the subscription schedule.\n\nYou can set a `proration_date` earlier than the current period only during the first period of a backdated subscription. In that case, the `proration_date` can be on or after the `subscription[start_date]` (backdated start date). In all other cases, the `proration_date` can’t be before the `current_period_start`.",

  "markdown": "# Using trial periods on subscriptions\n\n## Delay payments on active subscriptions using trial periods.\n\nYou can start a customer’s [subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/creating \"subscriptions\") with a free trial period by providing a `trial_end` argument when [creating the subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/api#create_subscription):\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/subscriptions \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d customer=  {{CUSTOMER_ID}}   \\  -d \"items[0][price]\"=  {{PRICE_ID}}   \\  -d trial_end=1610403705`\n\nThe `trial_end` parameter takes a timestamp indicating the exact moment the trial ends. When creating a subscription, you can alternatively use the [trial\\_period\\_days](https://docs.stripe.com/api#create_subscription-trial_period_days) parameter: an integer representing the number of days the trial lasts, from the current moment.\n\nWhen creating a subscription with a trial period, no payment method is required for the customer. An immediate [invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices \"invoices\") is still created, but for $0.\n\nWhen the trial ends, if the subscription `status` isn’t `paused`, we generate an invoice and send an `invoice.created` event notification. Approximately 1 hour later, we attempt to charge that invoice. A new billing cycle also begins for the customer when the trial ends.\n\nTo end a trial early, make an [update subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/api#update_subscription) API call, setting the `trial_end` value to a new timestamp, or **now** to end immediately:\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/subscriptions/`\n\n`{{SUBSCRIPTION_ID}}`\n\n `\\  -u \"  sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc  :\" \\  -d trial_end=now`\n\n## Combining trials with billing cycle anchor ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nAs of API version [`2018-02-05`](https://docs.stripe.com/upgrades#2018-02-05), you can also combine trials with `billing_cycle_anchor`, resulting in a free period followed by a prorated period, leading into a fixed billing cycle.\n\nFor example, suppose it’s the 15th of the month and you want to give your customer a free 7 day trial (until the 22nd), and then start normal billing on the 1st. You can do this through the API by combining trials with `billing_cycle_anchor`. (This isn’t currently available through the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/subscriptions).)\n\nIn this example, the customer gets an invoice for a _prorated_ amount on the 22nd (for the period until the 1st). Then, on the 1st, they’ll be invoiced again for the full amount, and again on the 1st of the following month, and so on.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/subscriptions \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d customer=  {{CUSTOMER_ID}}   \\  -d \"items[0][price]\"=  {{PRICE_ID}}   \\  -d trial_end=1610403705 \\  -d billing_cycle_anchor=1611008505`\n\n## Combining trials with usage-based billing ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nYou can use trial periods for subscriptions with [usage-based billing](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/pricing-models#usage-based-pricing). During the trial period, any usage accrued doesn’t count toward the total charged to the customer at the end of the billing cycle. After the trial period ends, usage accrues and is billed at the end of the next billing cycle.\n\n### Trials and aggregate usage![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nIf you use the `aggregate_usage` [parameter](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices/create#create_price-recurring-aggregate_usage) and set the behavior to `last_ever`, your customer will be billed for the last usage record if it falls within the trial period, even if the usage occurred during the trial period.\n\nFor example, if you provide file storage you might want to offer a month of free storage, but then charge for the first month if the customer continues to store files with your service.\n\n### Metered billing with paused subscriptions![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nSubscriptions that have subscription items with metered pricing bill in arrears because we need the total usage to determine the amount to bill. Paused subscriptions won’t allow usage events to be created for attached subscription items. Because it’s possible for you to resume a subscription in the middle of a billing period while leaving the billing cycle anchor unchanged, we support invoicing for the usage events with a timestamp after the subscription resumes.\n\n## Combining trials with add\\_invoice\\_items ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nTrial periods for subscriptions can be combined with one time prices and `add_invoice_items`. This may happen if you want to charge a one time fee or add on at the same time as starting a trial. Note that doing this will cause an invoice to be cut immediately for the amount of the one time item at the beginning of the trial.\n\n## Compliance requirements for trials and promotions ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nYou must comply with card network [requirements](https://support.stripe.com/questions/2020-visa-trial-subscription-requirement-changes-guide) when offering trials, whether they’re free or not. This includes scenarios like free trials or charging customers a reduced price for the first few months and then automatically charging them your normal rate. When using our trials features, you can enable [messaging settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/automatic) in the Stripe Dashboard to help you meet the requirements.\n\nIf you notify users of [successful payments](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/emails), Stripe automatically displays information about the trial and the cancellation URL in those notifications.\n\nIf you don’t use these settings, you’re still responsible for complying with the requirements.\n\nWhen customer emails are enabled, a reminder is sent seven days before a trial ends. If a trial is shorter than seven days, the reminder email is sent as soon as the trial begins. If trials are renewed, a reminder email is resent.\n\nIf both trial reminders and subscription renewal reminders are enabled during a trial, customers only receive the trial ending reminder. Renewal emails are then sent for subsequent billing periods.\n\nThe cancellation policy link is a URL that is displayed on customer receipts, along with other trial information. This information is included for all card payments. The cancellation URL is also included in the reminder email that is sent to customers seven days before their trial ends.\n\nFor statement descriptors, if you manually set the [statement descriptor](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/object#invoice_object-statement_descriptor) on the invoice, the trial text isn’t appended so you need to add it. If you use [product statement descriptors](https://docs.stripe.com/api/products/object#product_object-statement_descriptor), the trial text is appended automatically. If your statement descriptor is greater than 10 characters, make sure it still makes sense to your customers with the trial text appended. There is a 22 character [limit](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/statement-descriptors#requirements) so anything after the 10th character is overwritten with `* TRIAL OVER`.\n\nIf you don’t manually set the statement descriptor or use product statement descriptors, the trial text is appended to your account’s statement descriptor. If needed, you can set up a [shortened descriptor](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/public) to ensure the trial text displays correctly.\n\n### Meeting requirements without using Stripe’s features ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nIf you offer trials or promotions without using our trials features, you still need to comply with the [requirements](https://support.stripe.com/questions/2020-visa-trial-subscription-requirement-changes-guide). You can listen for the [invoice.upcoming](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-invoice.upcoming) event to determine when to send email notifications. To add text to your statement descriptor that indicates the promotion is over:\n\n*   Listen for the `customer.subscription.updated` event\n*   Check to see if a trial or promotion has ended\n*   Update the [statement descriptor](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update#update_invoice-statement_descriptor) on the subscription’s `latest_invoice`\n\nYou need to update the latest invoice within an hour of its creation while it’s still in draft status.\n\n## Create free trials without collecting payment method ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nYou can sign customers up for a free trial of a subscription without collecting their payment details in the Dashboard, the API, and Checkout. When you create the subscription, you can specify whether to cancel or pause the subscription if the customer didn’t provide a payment method during the trial period. To cancel or pause the subscription, set the `trial_settings.end_behavior.missing_payment_method` parameter when you create or update the subscription:\n\n*   **Cancel subscription**\\-If the free trial subscription ends without a payment method, it cancels immediately. You can create another subscription if the customer decides to subscribe to a paid plan in the future. Set `missing_payment_method=cancel` to cancel the subscription when it reaches the end of a trial without an available payment method.\n*   **Pause subscription**\\-If the free trial subscription ends without a payment method, it pauses and doesn’t cycle until it’s resumed. When a subscription is paused, it doesn’t generate invoices (unlike when a subscription’s [payment collection](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/pause-payment) is paused). When your customer adds their payment method after the subscription has paused, you can resume the same subscription. The subscription can remain paused indefinitely. Set `missing_payment_method=pause` to pause the subscription when it reaches the end of a trial without an available payment method.\n\nAlternatively, set `missing_payment_method=create_invoice` to invoice at the end of the trial if no payment method is present. If a payment method isn’t provided when the invoice finalizes, the subscription moves into `past_due`.\n\nConfigure reminder emails to collect customer’s payment details in your [free trial messaging settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/automatic).\n\n### Configure free trials without payment methods to cancel![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nUse the Dashboard, the API, or Checkout to create free trials of a subscription without collecting payment details from your customers, and to configure your subscription to cancel if the trial ends without a payment method.\n\nYou can use the Dashboard to sign customers up for a free trial of a subscription without collecting their payment details:\n\n1.  From the Subscriptions settings of the Dashboard, select **+Create subscription**.\n2.  After adding your customer and product information, select **+Add free trial**, then input how many days the free trial lasts.\n3.  Select the **Pause or cancel if free trial ends without a payment method** option, then select **Cancel immediately**. If you’re using [test clocks](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/testing/test-clocks), advance to the end of the trial. You won’t see an upcoming invoice for the subscription.\n4.  Listen to the `customer.subscription.deleted` event that informs you when a subscription cancels at the end of trials without a payment method.\n\nIf you provide a payment method or select the **Email invoice to customer with link to payment page** option, the **Pause or cancel if free trial ends without a payment method** option won’t be visible.\n\n### Configure free trials without payment methods to pause![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nUse the Dashboard, the API, or Checkout to create free trials of a subscription without collecting payment details from your customers, and to configure your subscription to pause if the trial ends without a payment method.\n\nYou can use the Dashboard to sign customers up for a free trial of a subscription without collecting their payment details:\n\n1.  From the Subscriptions settings of the Dashboard, select **+Create subscription**.\n2.  After adding your customer and product information, select **+Add free trial**, then input how many days the free trial lasts.\n3.  Select the **Pause or cancel if free trial ends without a payment method** option, then select **Pause**. If you’re using [test clocks](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/testing/test-clocks), advance to the end of the trial. You won’t see an upcoming invoice for the subscription.\n4.  Listen to the `customer.subscription.paused` event that informs you when a subscription pauses at the end of trials without a payment method.\n\nIf you provide a payment method or select the **Email invoice to customer with link to payment page** option, the **Pause or cancel if free trial ends without a payment method** option won’t be visible.\n\n### Collect payment details from your customer before their trial ends![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nConfigure your subscription to automatically send a reminder email when the customer’s trial is about to expire. You must comply with the card network requirements when offering trials. Learn more about [compliance requirements for trials and promotion](#compliance).\n\n### Webhook events![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n[Events](https://docs.stripe.com/api#event_types) are triggered every time a free trial changes. Make sure that your integration properly handles the events. For example, you might want to email a customer before a free trial ends. Learn more about [subscription webhook events](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/webhooks#events).\n\nThe following table describes the events that trigger before a free trial ends, when a trial subscription pauses or cancels, and when a subscription is resumed and becomes active.\n\n| Event | Description | Use case |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `customer.subscription.deleted` | Sent when a subscription ends. | Stop providing access to your product in response to this webhook. The subscription moves to the `canceled` status and sends this webhook after a free trial ends without a payment method and if the subscription’s `missing_payment_method` end behavior is set to `cancel`. |\n| `customer.subscription.resumed` | Sent when a subscription is no longer paused. When you receive this event, grant the customer access to the product if access was revoked while the subscription was paused. | Paused subscriptions are converted into active subscriptions after being resumed. Resuming a subscription might generate an invoice and corresponding Payment Intent that must be paid before the subscription moves out of the `paused` status. |\n| `customer.subscription.paused` | Sent when a subscription is fully paused. Invoicing won’t occur until the subscription resumes. When you receive this event, you can revoke the customer’s access to the product until they add a payment method and the subscription resumes. | Stop providing access to your product in response to this webhook. The subscription moves to the `paused` status and sends this webhook after a free trial ends without a payment method and if the subscription’s `missing_payment_method` end behavior is set to `pause`. The subscription remains `paused` until explicitly resumed. |\n| `customer.subscription.trial_will_end` | Sent three days before the trial period ends. If the trial is less than 3 days, this event is triggered. | Configure the subscription to automatically send an email to your customer 3 days before the trial period ends. |\n\n### Use the customer portal to collect payment![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nAfter you create a subscription for a customer without collecting a payment method, you can redirect them to the Billing customer portal to add their payment details.\n\nFirst, configure the [Billing customer portal](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management) to enable your customers to manage their subscriptions.\n\nNext, collect billing information from your customers:\n\n1.  Listen to the [`customer.subscription.trial_will_end` event](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-customer.subscription.trial_will_end).\n2.  If the subscription doesn’t have a [default payment method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/object#subscription_object-default_payment_method), get the customer’s email using the [Customers API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/retrieve) and send them a message with a link to your site. It’s helpful to embed the customer ID in the email. For example: `https://example.com?...&customer={{CUSTOMER_ID}}`.\n3.  When the customer enters your site, create a customer portal session using the customer ID from the previous step.\n4.  Redirect the customer to the customer portal, where they can update their subscription with payment details.\n\n### Allow customers to reactivate their subscriptions in the customer portal![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nTo enable the subscription of a customer whose trial ended in a `paused` subscription through the customer portal, enable the free trial without payment method feature when creating a new subscription in the Dashboard.\n\n### Send an email reminder before the trial ends![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nTo send a reminder email prior to the end of the trial, select the **Link to a Stripe-hosted page** option in the [Subscriptions and emails setting](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/automatic). The reminder email contains a link for the customer to add or update their payment details. We don’t send free trial reminder emails in [test mode](https://docs.stripe.com/test-mode \"test mode\"). Learn more about how to [setup free trial reminders](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/revenue-recovery/customer-emails#trial-ending-reminders).\n\nUse the `customer.subscription.trial_will_end` event to send your own hosted emails to customers. After you see the event in the Dashboard, it’s confirmed that your email has been sent.\n\n### Convert a trial if customers provide payment information before the trial ends![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nSubscriptions and upcoming invoices are created at the start of the trial and become active at the end of the trial if the customer provides a payment method.\n\n### Configure pausing when a payment method isn’t provided![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nAfter a free trial ends, you can configure subscriptions to pause if no default payment method is available for a subscription on a per-subscription basis.\n\nYou can update subscriptions while they’re paused. Updates that typically generate prorations (adding items, changing price or plan, changing quantity, and so on) won’t generate proration line items because the customer isn’t being charged while the subscription is paused. If you want to extend a trial after a subscription transitions into a `paused` status, you must resume the subscription before configuring a trial.\n\nWe check `default_source` and `default_payment_method` on the subscription and customer to determine whether a subscription is missing a payment method at the end of a trial.\n\n### Resume a paused subscription![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nUse the Dashboard, API, customer portal, or Hosted Invoice Page to resume a paused subscription.\n\nTo resume a paused subscription in the Dashboard, navigate to the subscription, then select **Resume Subscription** under the **Actions** menu. Select **Reset billing cycle** or **Always invoice** (if you’re not resetting the billing cycle) from the **Resume subscription** modal to charge the customer immediately.\n\n### Invoicing a subscription![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nWhile paused, a subscription won’t create an invoice. If you want to continue creating invoices, use `pause_collection` to stop collecting payments while continuing to invoice and advance billing periods.\n\nTo preview the invoice that’s generated when a paused subscription is resumed, specify a [subscription\\_resume\\_at](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming#upcoming_invoice-subscription_resume_at).\n\n## See also![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n*   [Products and prices](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/overview)\n*   [Prices](https://docs.stripe.com/api#prices)\n*   [Subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/api#subscriptions)\n*   [Managing subscription billing cycles](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/billing-cycle)",

  "url": "https://docs.stripe.com/billing/collection-method",
  "markdown": "# Billing collection methods | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Configure your preferred method to collect on invoices and subscriptions.\n\nYou can set your preferred payment collection method when creating [invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices \"invoices\") and [subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/creating \"subscriptions\") using either the Dashboard or API.\n\n## Automatic charging versus manual payments ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nThe collection method determines how Stripe processes the payment for both products. To collect payments for invoices and subscriptions, you can select from these methods:\n\n*   Automatic charging\n*   Manual payments\n\n#### Note\n\nManual payment methods, such as wire transfers, have more rigorous tracking and reconciliation processes, which [enterprise clients](#enterprise-clients-wire-transfers) often require for high transaction volumes. Some payment methods, such as [bank transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/bank-transfer), only support `send_invoice` and can’t be charged automatically.\n\n### Set a collection method for an invoice ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nTo set a collection method for an invoice through the Invoicing API, use the [collection\\_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/object#invoice_object-collection_method) attribute.\n\n*   `charge_automatically`: Lets you automatically charge a customer’s default payment method to pay invoices.\n*   `send_invoice`: Sends an invoice for manual payment. Unlike automatic charging which requires immediate payment, you can give the customer an adjustable payment window. You can use the [Hosted Invoice Page](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/hosted-invoice-page) and set up [email notifications and reminders](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/send-email#customer-emails) to facilitate payment.\n\n### Set a collection method for a subscription ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nTo set a collection method for a subscription through the Subscriptions API, use the [collection\\_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/object#subscription_object-collection_method) attribute. If you change the collection method for a subscription, only subsequently created subscription invoices use the new collection method.\n\n*   `charge_automatically`: Tells Stripe to automatically charge your customer’s default payment method to pay the invoice generated for each subscription period.\n*   `send_invoice`: Generates an invoice for each billing period, and requires manual payment. Unlike automatic charging which requires immediate payment, you can give the customer an adjustable payment window.\n\n## Collection methods and failed payments ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nDepending on the collection method, failed payments generate different [subscription statuses](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/object#subscription_object-status) and [invoice statuses](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/object#invoice_object-status).\n\n### Failed subscription payments ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nCreating a subscription with a [payment\\_behavior](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/create#create_subscription-payment_behavior) of `allow_incomplete`, and the `collection_method` set to `charge_automatically`, immediately attempts payment and marks the subscription `status` as `incomplete` if the initial payment attempt doesn’t succeed.\n\nPassing a `payment_behavior` of `default_incomplete` will always initialize subscriptions with an `incomplete` status if the first invoice requires payment. The resulting PaymentIntent must be confirmed in a separate request in order to attempt payment.\n\nFor both `allow_incomplete` and `default_incomplete`, the subscription becomes `active` after the first invoice is paid. Subscriptions that do not require payment upon creation (like those that are trialing) will immediately have a status of `active`. If the first invoice remains unpaid after 23 hours, the subscription is set to `incomplete_expired`. This status is final and irreversible, voiding the open invoice and preventing future invoices.\n\n#### Failed incomplete subscriptions ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nWhen a subscription has a status of `incomplete`, you can only update attributes that won’t result in the creation of an invoice or invoice item, such as its [metadata](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/object#subscription_object-metadata), [save\\_default\\_payment\\_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/object#subscription_object-payment_settings-save_default_payment_method), and [description](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/object#subscription_object-description).\n\nIf a payment to renew the subscription fails when you’ve set it to charge automatically, the subscription transitions to `past_due` and Stripe may mark it as `canceled` or `unpaid` (depending on your [subscriptions settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/automatic)) after Stripe exhausts all payment retry attempts.\n\nOn the other hand, if the subscription’s `collection_method` is set to `send_invoice`, it becomes `past_due` when its invoice remains unpaid by the due date. If the customer still hasn’t paid the invoice after you extend the deadline, Stripe may mark the subscription as `canceled` or `unpaid`, which again depends on your subscription settings.\n\nWhen a subscription has a status of `unpaid`, Stripe creates future invoices but leaves them as drafts. In this case, you have the option to [resend](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/send) the `past due` invoice and any created draft invoices to collect payment. Use this feature if you’re trying to collect payment for unpaid months (such as when you continue to provide the goods or services related to an unpaid subscription) or leave them closed and unpaid when you stop providing goods or services.\n\n### Failed invoicing payments ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nInvoices not associated with subscriptions that have their `collection_method` set to `charge_automatically` and [auto-advancement](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/automatic-advancement-collection) disabled, remain `open` if an initial payment attempt fails. Because auto-advancement is disabled, Stripe doesn’t automatically close the invoices, retry them, or transition them to a different status. Learn more about [failed payment notifications](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/automatic-collection#failed-payment-notifications) and [managing invoices sent to customers](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/automatic-collection#manage-invoices-sent-customers).\n\nIf [auto-advancement](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/automatic-advancement-collection) is enabled for the invoice, Stripe may automatically mark the invoice as `uncollectible` (depending on your [invoice status settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/automatic)) after Stripe exhausts all payment retry attempts.\n\nWhen the collection method is set to `send_invoice`, the invoice requires manual payment. If the invoice remains unpaid past the due date, the status becomes `past_due`, indicating an overdue invoice. If you extend the payment deadline and the customer still hasn’t paid, you can leave the invoice as `past_due` or transition it to `uncollectible` or `void`.\n\n## Enterprise clients and wire transfers ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nFor enterprise clients, manual payment methods, such as wire transfers, offer some advantages. These payment methods often involve more rigorous tracking and reconciliation processes compared to automated methods, which is crucial for enterprises that deal with high transaction volumes. By setting the `collection_method` to `send_invoice`, you can generate clear and well-documented invoices that enterprise clients can pay using wire transfers—a commonly preferred payment method for this type of client.\n\n## See also![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n*   [Automatic collection](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/automatic-collection)\n*   [Automatic charging](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/automatic-charging)\n*   [Subscription invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/invoices/subscription)\n*   [Status transitions and finalization](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/workflow-transitions)",

  "markdown": "# Set payment methods per-subscription | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Learn how to specify which payment methods are allowed for a subscription.\n\nThe [subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/creating \"subscriptions\") `payment_settings` [parameter](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/object#subscription_object-payment_settings) lets you set specific payment methods on individual subscriptions. This allows more flexibility than a single `default_payment_method` or less granular customer settings.\n\nTo enable payment methods, you first need to activate them in your [account settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payments).\n\nIn some situations, there might be restrictions that prevent payment methods from being used for a subscription. For instance, a payment method might only operate in one currency, or have limitations on the amount that can be paid. Stripe doesn’t automatically select a payment method when these limitations prevent it from being used.\n\n## Manually select payment methods ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nYou can override the payment methods that can be used to pay a subscription by changing its [payment settings](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/object#subscription_object-payment_settings).\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/subscriptions/sub_49ty4767H20z6a \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d \"payment_settings[payment_method_types][]\"=card \\  -d \"payment_settings[payment_method_types][]\"=customer_balance`\n\nIf you configured a default payment method on either the [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-invoice_settings-default_payment_method) or the [Subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/object#subscription_object-default_payment_method), be sure to include it in the list of `payment_method_types`. Otherwise, that method will not be used and payment could fail.\n\n## Payment method priority ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nBy default, customers can pay a subscription’s generated [invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices \"invoices\") with any of the enabled payment methods in your [invoice template settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/invoice). This takes precedence over the older `default_source` [customer setting](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-default_source).\n\nIf set, a subscription’s `payment_settings.payment_method_types` takes priority over default invoice settings, but only for that specific subscription. Payment method types are passed onto the subscription’s [setup intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_intents) and invoices.\n\nYou can further specify a subscription’s `default_payment_method`, or the older `default_source`, to prioritize which payment method is attempted.\n\n## Payment method errors ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nPayment method errors can prevent a subscription from being created. This can happen when:\n\n*   You manually select a payment method but a restriction, such as supported currencies, prevents it from being used.\n*   A payment method isn’t activated for your account\n\nErrors can also occur at time of payment, and Stripe can’t finalize the invoice. See invoicing [payment method errors](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/payment-methods#payment-method-errors) for details.\n\n### Payment method options ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nSome payment methods have additional options that you can set to customize the payment experience.

Any promotion codes that are associated with the coupon are also restricted to this list of eligible products.\n\nIf you configure a coupon to apply to specific products and a subscription doesn’t have any applicable products, no discount is applied when you add the coupon to the subscription.\n\nWhen you [make changes](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/change) to a subscription, any existing discounts are applied when proration is calculated. You can’t discount proration line items further on the invoice that’s generated.\n\n### Apply coupons to subscriptions ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nAfter you’ve created coupons, create a discount by applying them to a subscription. You can apply the coupon when you create the subscription or by [updating a customer’s existing subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/api#update_subscription).\n\n1.  In the Dashboard, open the **Billing** page and click **Subscriptions**.\n2.  Click the relevant subscription.\n3.  Click **Actions**.\n4.  Click **Update subscription**.\n5.  Click **Add coupon**.\n6.  Select one or more coupons from the dropdown menus and click **Submit**.\n\nYou can still create a subscription when a customer doesn’t have a stored payment method if no immediate payment is required after you apply coupons to it.\n\n### Apply coupons to customers ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nIf you add a coupon to a customer, the coupon applies to all subscriptions for that customer, including subscriptions added later. To prevent discounting all recurring charges for a customer, add coupons to subscriptions instead of customers.\n\nA coupon attached to a subscription takes priority over a coupon attached to a customer. If you add coupons to a subscription, any coupons attached to the customer are not automatically applied. You must add the customer coupons to the subscription if you want those to apply as well.\n\n1.  In the Dashboard, open the [Customers](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/customers) page and select the customer.\n2.  Click **Actions**\n3.  Click **Apply coupon**.\n4.  Select a coupon from the dropdown menu and click **Submit**.\n\n### Apply coupons to Checkout ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nApply coupons to subscriptions in a Checkout Session by setting the `discounts` parameter in the [API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-discounts). To create a session with an applied discount, pass the coupon ID in the `coupon` parameter of the `discounts` array. This coupon overrides any coupon on the customer.\n\nIf you’re creating a subscription with an existing customer, any coupon associated with the customer is applied to the subscription’s invoices.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/checkout/sessions \\   -u` \n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`: \\   -d \"payment_method_types[]\"=card \\   -d \"line_items[][price]\"=  {{PRICE_ID}}   \\   -d \"line_items[][quantity]\"=1 \\   -d mode=subscription \\   -d \"discounts[][coupon]\"=\"{{COUPON_ID}}\" \\   -d success_url=\"[https://example.com/success](https://example.com/success)\" \\   -d cancel_url=\"[https://example.com/cancel](https://example.com/cancel)\"`\n\n### Delete coupons ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nYou can delete coupons with the Dashboard or the [API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/coupons/delete).\n\nDeleting a coupon prevents it from being applied to future subscriptions or customers, but it doesn’t remove the discount from any subscription or customer that already has it.\n\n1.  In the Dashboard, open the [Products](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/products?active=true) page.\n2.  Click **Coupons**\n3.  Click the relevant coupon.\n4.  Click the overflow menu ().\n5.  Click **Delete coupon**.\n\n### Coupon duration![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nA coupon’s duration indicates how long the redeemed [discount](https://docs.stripe.com/api/#discounts) is valid for. For example, a coupon for 50% off with a duration of 4 months applies to all invoices in the 4 month period starting when the coupon is first applied. If a customer applies this coupon to a yearly subscription during the coupon’s 4 month period, the 50% discount applies to the entire yearly subscription. In a monthly subscription, the coupon applies to the first 4 months. For a weekly subscription, a 4 month coupon applies to every invoice in the first 4 months.\n\nIf you’re configuring a coupon’s duration in the API, when you use the value `repeating` you must specify `duration_in_months` as the number of months that the coupon repeatedly applies to. If you set the duration to `once`, the coupon applies only to the first invoice. If you set the duration to `forever`, the coupon applies to all invoices indefinitely.\n\n### Redemption limits![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nRedemption limits apply to the coupon across every customer. For example, if you limit the number of times a coupon can be redeemed to 50, you can apply it to your customers only 50 times. This can be one time each for 50 different customers, one customer 50 times, or multiple customers multiple times until the max of 50 times.\n\nIf you set a coupon to last forever when a customer uses it but the coupon has an expiration date, any customer given that coupon will have that coupon’s discount forever. No new customers can apply the coupon after the expiration date.\n\nPromotion codes are customer-facing codes that you create for coupons. For example, FALLPROMO and SPRINGPROMO can both point to a single 25% off coupon. You can share promotion codes directly with your customers to use at checkout.\n\nIf you’ve implemented the [customer portal](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/customer-portal \"customer portal\") and turned on promotion codes, customers can apply a discount when upgrading or downgrading their existing subscriptions in the portal.\n\nCustomize controls and limits on promotion codes by specifying eligible customers, first time orders, minimum order values, expiration dates, and redemption limits.\n\n### Restrictions![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThere are some restrictions to promotion codes.\n\n*   You can’t apply a promotion code with amount restrictions on:\n    *   [Customer objects](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object)\n    *   [Subscription Item objects](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscription_items/object)\n    *   [Invoice Item objects](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscription_items/object)\n    *   [Subscriptions objects](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/object) when you make an update\n    *   Future phases on [Subscription Schedule objects](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscription_schedules/object)\n\n### Create promotion codes![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYou can create a promotion code in the Dashboard when you [create a coupon](#create-coupons--create-coupons).\n\nThe **Code** is case-insensitive and unique across active promotion codes for any customer. For example:\n\n*   You can create multiple customer-restricted promotion codes with the same **Code**, but you can’t reuse that **Code** for a promotion code that any customer can redeem.\n*   If you create a promotion code that is redeemable by any customer, you can’t create another active promotion code with the same **code**.\n*   You can create a promotion code with one **Code**, [inactivate](#inactive-promotions--inactivate) it, and then create a new promotion code with the same **Code**.\n\n1.  In the Dashboard on the [Create a coupon](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/coupons/create) page, click the **Use customer-facing coupon codes** button.\n2.  Enter a code. This is the code that a customer enters at checkout to redeem the discount. If you don’t set a code, Stripe generates one for you.\n3.  Select requirements for the promotion code. For example, you can restrict the coupon to only being valid on first-time orders.\n\nWhen you create a promotion code, it inherits the configuration of the associated coupon.\n\n### Promotion code configurations ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nBy configuring the promotion code settings, you can customize the following:\n\n*   Which customers are eligible to use a promotion code\n*   How many times a customer can redeem a promotion code\n*   When a promotion code expires\n*   Set a minimum amount a promotion code can apply to\n\n### Limit by customer![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nTo limit a promotion code to a particular customer complete these steps:\n\n1.  On the [Create a coupon](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/coupons/create) page, select **Limit to a specific customer**.\n2.  Select the relevant customer. If you don’t specify a customer, any customer can redeem the promotion code.\n\n### Limit by first time order![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nTo limit a promotion code to a customer’s first order, on the [Create a coupon](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/coupons/create) page, select **Eligible for first-time order only**.\n\n### Set a minimum amount![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nTo set an minimum amount that is eligible for a promotion code, on the [Create a coupon](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/coupons/create) page, select **Require minimum order value** and enter the minimum value.\n\nBecause promotion code restrictions are checked at redemption time, the minimum transaction amount only applies to the initial payment for a subscription.\n\nIf the coupon supports multiple currencies, the minimum amount can be different per-currency.\n\n### Customize expirations![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nTo set an expiration date for a promotion code, on the [Create a coupon](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/coupons/create) page, select **Add an expiration date** and the date and time at which the promotion code expires.\n\nIf the underlying coupon already has an expiration date set, then the promotion code’s expiration date can’t be later than the coupon’s.\n\nFor example, you might have plans to support a coupon for a year, but you only want it to be redeemable for one week after a customer receives it. To do this, set the coupon’s expiration date to one year from now, and set each the promotion code’s expiration date to one week after it is created.\n\n### Limit redemptions![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nTo set the number of times a customer can redeem the promotion code, on the [Create a coupon](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/coupons/create) page, select **Limit the number of times this code can be redeemed** and enter the number.\n\nIf the underlying coupon already has a maximum number of times set, then the promotion code’s maximum redemptions can’t be greater than the coupon’s.\n\n### Deactivate promotion codes ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nTo deactivate a promotion code, doing the following steps:\n\n1.  In the Dashboard, open the [Products](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/products?active=true) page.\n2.  Click **Coupons**.\n3.  Click the coupon whose promotion code you want to deactivate.\n4.  In the relevant promotion code row, click the overflow menu ().\n5.  Click **Archive promotion code**.\n\nHowever, if the underlying coupon for a promotion code becomes invalid, all of its promotion codes become permanently inactive. Similarly, if a promotion code reaches its maximum redemption limit or its expiration date, it becomes permanently inactive. These promotion codes can’t be reactivated.\n\n### Apply promotion codes to subscriptions ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nAfter you create a promotion code, redeem a discount by applying the promotion code to a subscription. You can apply promotion codes two ways:\n\n*   When you [create a subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/api#create_subscription)\n*   When you [update a customer’s existing subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/api#update_subscription)\n\n1.  In the Dashboard, go to **Billing** > **Subscriptions**.\n2.  Click the relevant subscription.\n3.  Click **Actions** > **Update subscription** > **Add coupon**.\n4.  Click a promotion code from the dropdown menu and click **Submit**.\n\n### Add promotion codes to Checkout![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nEnable promotion codes with the API by setting the [allow\\_promotion\\_codes](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/object#checkout_session_object-allow_promotion_codes) parameter in Checkout Sessions. When `allow_promotion_codes` is enabled on a Checkout Session, Checkout includes a promotion code redemption box for your customers to use.\n\n![Promotion code field at checkout](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/promo_code_checkout.c07ef6d4f0b1b3f9a8a7e4bbba83d56f.png)\n\nPromotion code field at checkout\n\n## Stackable coupons and promotion codes ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nYou can add multiple coupons, promotion codes, or redeemed [discounts](https://docs.stripe.com/api/#discounts) to a customer’s list of charges. You can do this when [creating a subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/api#create_subscription) or by [updating a customer’s existing subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/api#update_subscription).\n\nWe support multiple discounts on both subscriptions and subscription items.\n\n1.  In the Dashboard, go to **Billing** > **Subscriptions**.\n2.  Click the relevant subscription.\n3.  Click **Actions** > **Update subscription** > **Add coupon**.\n4.  Click coupons from the dropdown menus and click **Submit**.\n5.  Click the relevant product.\n6.  Click **Add coupons**.\n7.  Click coupons from the dropdown menus and click **Submit**.\n\n#### Note\n\nYou can start using the new `discounts` parameter on any subscription. We automatically clear out the singular `discount` field when `discounts` with more than one entry is passed in an update.\n\n### Restrictions ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nThere are some restrictions to using multiple discounts.\n\n*   You can set up to 20 entries in the `discounts` parameter.\n*   Each entry in `discounts` has to be unique.\n*   You can not pass in a coupon and a promotion code created from the same coupon.\n*   You can not pass in a coupon and a discount that is generated from the same coupon.\n*   Redeemed discounts must already be attached to the customer or subscription that you’re updating.\n\n### Update a subscription![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYou don’t need to set `discounts` if you don’t intend to make changes to existing discounts.\n\nWhen updating `discounts`, you need to pass in any previously set `coupon`, `promotion_code` or `discount` you want to keep on the subscription.\n\nPass `discounts = \"\"` to clear all discounts from the subscription. When a subscription has no discounts, the customer-level discount, if any, applies to invoices.\n\nIf you have already set more than one discount on a subscription with the new `discounts` parameter, you can not update the subscription with the deprecated `coupon` or `promotion_code` parameter. Similarly, you can not update a schedule’s phases with the deprecated `coupon` or `promotion_code` parameter if you have set more than one discount on a prior phase.\n\nUpdating `discounts` does not incur prorations or generate an invoice on its own. The new discounts are applied the next time the subscription creates an invoice.\n\n## Alternative discount methods ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nAlthough coupons are the most common way to discount a subscription, you can also do the following:\n\n*   Add a negative [customer balance](https://docs.stripe.com/api#customer_object-balance) to the customer.\n*   Add negative [invoice items](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/invoices/subscription#adding-draft-invoice-items).\n*   Add a [second price](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/manage-prices#create-price) that is a cheaper version of a product’s usual price.\n\nOf these methods, negative invoice items provide more detailed information as to what discount was created, when, and why.\n\n## See also![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n*   [Changing subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/change)\n*   [Working with invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/invoices/subscription)\n*   [Coupons API](https://docs.stripe.com/api#coupons)\n*   [Promotion codes API](https://docs.stripe.com/api#promotion_codes)",

  "markdown": "# SCA migration guide for Billing\n\n## Update your Billing implementation to support new Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) requirements.\n\n#### Note\n\nAs of April 2021, issuing banks in India have started taking steps to block transactions that don’t comply with the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) [directive on the processing of e-mandates](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=11668) for recurring transactions. Businesses with customers in India should implement the changes outlined in this guide to prevent seeing higher payment failure rates on recurring transactions. Learn more on our [dedicated support page](https://support.stripe.com/questions/background-on-indian-government-regulations-affecting-card-payments).\n\n#### Note\n\nBeginning September 14, 2019, PSD2 regulation requires [Strong Customer Authentication](https://docs.stripe.com/strong-customer-authentication \"Strong Customer Authentication\") for many online payments made by European customers. Businesses based in the [European Economic Area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Economic_Area) (EEA) with customers in the EEA should implement the changes outlined in this guide to prevent declined payments.\n\n## Strong Customer Authentication ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\n[Strong Customer Authentication (SCA)](https://docs.stripe.com/strong-customer-authentication), a regulation that took effect on September 14, 2019, as part of PSD2 in Europe, requires changes to how your European customers authenticate online payments. This regulation [applies](https://docs.stripe.com/strong-customer-authentication) to online payments where the customer’s bank and the business are both in the [European Economic Area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Economic_Area \"European Economic Area\") (EEA).\n\nSCA requires that businesses use two [independent authentication elements](https://stripe.com/guides/strong-customer-authentication#what-is-strong-customer-authentication) to verify payments. In practice, this means adding a new payment step where your customers must confirm their payment using an authentication method like a password, hardware token, or biometric. [3D Secure 2](https://stripe.com/guides/3d-secure-2) is the primary authentication method used to meet SCA requirements for card payments.\n\nTransactions that don’t meet these authentication requirements and that don’t qualify for an exemption may be declined.\n\n## Stripe Billing changes ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nDue to the increased payment friction caused by SCA, you can expect longer collection times and lower conversion rates. The changes to Stripe Billing allow you to maximize your revenue under these constraints. These changes include:\n\n*   New [subscription statuses](#summary-statuses) to facilitate initial payment\n*   [PaymentIntents](#summary-payment-intents) that are now exposed on [invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices \"invoices\") as a mechanism for multi-state payments\n*   [SetupIntents](#summary-pending-setup-intent) that can be used to collect authentication while customers are on-session\n*   A new [webhook](#summary-webhooks) that indicates when SCA is required for payment\n*   An updated [Hosted Invoice Page](#hip) allowing customers to complete the authentication step required by SCA\n*   A new set of [dunning emails](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/send-email \"dunning email\") to help collect payment when SCA is required\n\n## How SCA impacts Billing ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nSCA impacts card charges between EEA businesses and EEA customers. This changes how on-session and off-session payments are made.\n\n| Term | Example | Impact |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| On-session | An e-commerce checkout flow or when a customer signs up and pays for a subscription. | When SCA is required, your customer needs to provide payment authentication. This is usually completed by redirecting your customer to their bank for authentication. |\n| Off-session | A monthly subscription automatically charged using a stored card. | Some off-session payments are [exempt](#sca-exemptions) from SCA. For off-session payments that do require SCA, you need to bring your customer on-session so that they can complete the authentication flow. |\n\n## Using previous authorization agreements ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nYou can use [Previous authorization agreements](https://docs.stripe.com/strong-customer-authentication/previous-authorization-agreements) for off-session payments when they meet the following criteria:\n\n*   Cards from EU customers saved before December 31, 2020\n*   Cards from UK customers saved before September 14, 2021\n\nFor the following scenarios, this means that you don’t have to save the cards again and re-authenticate these customers. If you use Stripe for non-recurring payments, refer to the [out of scope payments](https://docs.stripe.com/strong-customer-authentication/previous-authorization-agreements#preparing) guide.\n\n| Goal | How you saved the card before the eligibility cutoff | What to do after the eligibility period |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Continue a subscription with previously saved card** | By passing a token, source, or payment method to a `Customer` | No action |\n| **Create a new subscription with previously saved card** | By passing a token, source, or payment method to a `Customer` | Create a subscription with the [off\\_session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/create#create_subscription-off_session) parameter |\n| **Collect a subscription payment after trial ends** | By [creating a trial subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/trials) pre-SCA that ends after the eligibility period | No action |\n| **Create a standalone invoice with previously saved card** | By [passing a token, source, or payment method](https://docs.stripe.com/saving-cards) to a `Customer` | [Pay](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/pay) or [create a one-off invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/dashboard#create-invoice) |\n\n## Updating your Billing integration to support SCA ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nThe updates you need to make to your integration depend on how you use Stripe Billing. There are four possible scenarios you need to manage to support SCA. You need to evaluate your integration against these scenarios to find out which ones apply to you.\n\n*   [Scenario 1](#scenario-1): Charging customers on-session for their initial payment\n*   [Scenario 2](#scenario-2): Charging customers off-session for their initial payment\n*   [Scenario 3](#scenario-3): Managing recurring charges after customers make their first payment\n*   [Scenario 4](#scenario-4): One-off invoices\n\nThe first scenario applies to you if you immediately charge your customers when they subscribe. This means that your customer’s first payment is on-session. The second scenario applies to you if you don’t immediately charge your customers when they subscribe, and their initial payment occurs when they’re off-session.\n\nThe third scenario applies to most Billing users because it’s for managing recurring payments. These are any payments that occur after the first payment is made. The fourth scenario only applies to you if you use [one-off invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/dashboard#create-invoice).\n\nRegardless of the scenarios that apply to your integration, when you create [subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/creating \"subscriptions\"), you can [expand](https://docs.stripe.com/api/expanding_objects) the [latest\\_invoice.payment\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/object#subscription_object-latest_invoice) attribute to determine the outcome of a payment. You can also expand [pending\\_setup\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/object#subscription_object-pending_setup_intent) when handling subscriptions without an initial payment as shown in [scenario 2](#scenario-2).\n\n## Scenario 1: Charging customers on-session for their initial payment ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nWhen charging immediately, your customers’ first charge for a subscription requires SCA. This means you need to add handling for authentication in your application checkout or signup flow. When setting up a subscription for the first time, customers are on-session. This means that they’re on a browser or app and able to react to your prompts.\n\n![diagram showing how a payment that requires SCA will return with a status of requires_action](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/sca_scenario1.df6584effe5cd9769f5b4ac0705272e8.png)\n\nWhen setting up a subscription that bills immediately, Stripe attempts to charge the card on file for your customer as part of the [Create Subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/create) or [Create Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/create) call which generates the subscription.\n\n### Step 1: Creating subscriptions ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nSubscriptions have new [incomplete statuses](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication#summary-statuses) that you need to use to support SCA. However, you have two options for accessing these statuses. The first option allows you to remain on an older API version but requires you to pass a flag in some of your API calls. The second option is upgrading your API version. The options are explained in subsequent sections but the diagrams below provide an overview of the subscription behavior with these statuses.\n\nWhen a payment succeeds, the subscription’s status is set to `active` and no further action is required. When a payment fails, the subscription’s status is set to `incomplete` and the `latest_invoice.payment_intent.status` attribute is set to `requires_payment_method`. In these situations, you should charge the customer with another payment method using the [Pay Invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/pay) endpoint.\n\n![How to handle a subscription payment failure.](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/initial_payment_fail.110591368c0834d7cb92f3ded955b2fe.svg)\n\nWhen a payment requires SCA, the subscription’s status is set to `incomplete` and the `latest_invoice.payment_intent.status` attribute is set to `requires_action`. In these situations, you need your customer to complete a [3D Secure](https://stripe.com/guides/3d-secure-2) authentication flow using `latest_invoice.payment_intent`. The [next step](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication#scenario-1-handling-sca) explains how to do this.\n\n![How to handle a subscription requiring SCA.](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/initial_payment_sca.1407dfe31f9c73a82094d8dbd51f6f02.svg)\n\nYou can use the [regulatory test cards](https://docs.stripe.com/testing#regulatory-cards) to explore this behavior in your test environment. For detailed instructions on how to build a complete subscriptions integration, see the [integration guide](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/build-subscriptions).\n\n#### Option 1: Using the payment behavior flag![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nIf you don’t upgrade your API version, but pass a new [payment\\_behavior=allow\\_incomplete](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/create#create_subscription-payment_behavior) flag on subscription create and update calls, your subscriptions will use the new [incomplete status](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication#summary-statuses) functionality. This allows you to manage scenarios that require SCA, which is explained in the [next step](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication#scenario-1-handling-sca). See the [FAQ](#faq) at the bottom of this document for a complete list of endpoints you need to pass this flag to.\n\nIf you don’t upgrade your API version, and don’t pass the `payment_behavior` flag, attempts to create subscriptions that require SCA will fail and return a [card\\_error](https://docs.stripe.com/api/errors#errors-card_error). This is consistent with legacy behavior that blocks subscription creation if payment fails.\n\n#### Option 2: Upgrading your API![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nIf you upgrade to API version [2019-03-14](https://docs.stripe.com/upgrades#2019-03-14) or newer, your subscriptions automatically use the new [incomplete status](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication#summary-statuses) functionality. After upgrading your API, you can move on to the [next step](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication#scenario-1-handling-sca).\n\n### Step 2: Handling SCA ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nIn order to complete payment on a charge that requires SCA, you can either use [Stripe.js](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/elements) or a browser-redirect flow. Stripe.js is recommended because most Stripe users already use it, and it makes it easier to manage 3DS authentication. Using Stripe.js involves passing the `latest_invoice.payment_intent.client_secret` into the [confirmCardPayment](https://docs.stripe.com/js#stripe-confirm-card-payment) method, which displays a modal that allows the customer to provide authentication for their payment.\n\nAlternatively, if you prefer to not use Stripe.js, you can pass a `return_url` to the PaymentIntent confirmation endpoint and initiate a redirect flow:\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/payment_intents/{{PAYMENT_INTENT_ID}}/confirm \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\   --data-urlencode return_url=\"[https://www.example.com/return_url](https://www.example.com/return_url)\"`\n\nFor more details about using the [Payment Intents API](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents \"Payment Intents API\") to complete [3D Secure](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure \"3D Secure (3DS)\") authentication for Billing, see the [overview guide](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/overview#requires-action).\n\nAfter the customer successfully completes the redirect or modal flow, the subscription status is `active` and the invoice status is `paid`. Be aware that the customer might quit their browser after authentication, but before being redirected. To provide more robust handling, Stripe recommends listening to invoice [webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks \"webhook\") as described in the next step.\n\n### Step 3: Provisioning and fulfillment ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nIt’s possible for customers to leave their browser before the `confirmCardPayment` callback executes, or before the `return_url` redirect occurs. In these cases, your application might not be aware that payment is complete, and the associated product might not be provisioned for your customer. You can avoid these situations by listening to the [invoice.paid](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-invoice.paid) event notification to verify that the invoice is `paid` and `billing_reason=subscription_create`. This means you can provision the subscription for your customer.\n\n## Scenario 2: Charging customers off-session for their initial payment ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nCreating subscriptions with [free trials](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/trials), using [metered billing](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/pricing-models#usage-based-pricing), and invoices discounted through coupons or customer balances often result in non-payment invoices. This means the customer isn’t immediately charged when the subscription is created. In these situations, you need to [save the customer’s payment information](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/save-and-reuse) and authenticate their card while they’re on-session so that you can charge them later.\n\nTo manage situations like this, Stripe created the [Setup Intents API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_intents \"Setup Intents API\"), which allows you to:\n\n*   Collect payment information\n*   Authenticate the customer’s card\n*   Authorize the customer’s card without charging it\n\nCollecting payment information upfront and authenticating payments allows Stripe to apply for exemptions on your behalf. These exemptions generally decrease the chance that 3DS is required when you charge customers off-session.\n\nIf subscription creation does not require an initial payment and if authentication is recommended while the customer is on-session, Stripe Billing automatically creates a SetupIntent. This is exposed on the Subscription object through the [pending\\_setup\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/object#subscription_object-pending_setup_intent) attribute. See the [Using SetupIntents](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/overview#using-setupintents) section to learn more about SetupIntents and how to use them with Billing. To create subscriptions and charge customers off-session for their initial payment, you need to:\n\n1.  Use [CreatePaymentMethod](https://docs.stripe.com/js#stripe-create-payment-method) to collect payment information\n2.  [Create a customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/create#create_customer-payment_method) using the ID of the [PaymentMethod](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods \"PaymentMethods\") you created\n3.  [Create the subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/create)\n4.  Set up error handling using [confirmCardSetup](https://docs.stripe.com/js#stripe-confirm-card-setup) for authentication failures and [confirmCardPayment](https://docs.stripe.com/js#stripe-confirm-card-payment) for authorization failures\n\nYou can also use SetupIntents to change the payment method on a customer or subscription. The [saving cards without payment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/save-and-reuse) section explains how to do this at the customer level. At the subscription level, Stripe automatically updates the `pending_setup_intent` field on the subscription object if authentication is recommended on the updated default payment method.\n\n## Scenario 3: Managing recurring charges after customers make their first payment ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nRecurring charges usually occur when customers are off-session. If no [exemptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication#sca-exemptions) apply to the charge, and SCA is required, you need to bring your user on-session so they can complete the payment. To do this, you can use Stripe’s prebuilt tools or create your own solution. The diagram below explains these options in more detail.\n\n![Recurring payments flow for subscriptions.](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/scenario3.0181edcaab626b8acdebc3195b3bd35a.svg)\n\nWhen a billing cycle date or a subscription threshold is reached, payment for the associated subscription is attempted. If the charge requires SCA, the subscription status changes to `past_due`. With Stripe’s tools, you can enable a [set of emails](#settings-3ds-payment) specific to 3D Secure to be sent to your customers when SCA is required. Alternatively, if you want to send your own emails but don’t want to build your own authentication flow, you can use our [Hosted Invoice Page](#hip).\n\nIf you choose to build your own solution, you can listen to the new `invoice.payment_action_required` webhook or the existing `customer.subscription.updated` webhook to be notified of subscriptions that become `past_due` because of SCA requirements. When this happens, you need to bring your customer back on-session and have them complete an authentication flow similar to what is explained in the [first scenario](#scenario-1).\n\nAfter the payment is authenticated and succeeds, the subscription status updates to `active` and the invoice status updates to `paid`.\n\n## Scenario 4: One-off invoices ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nOne-off invoices can also be subject to SCA. The changes you need to make to manage one-off invoices depends on how you use Billing today. If you already use our Hosted Invoice Page, you get SCA support out of the box without making any changes. If you use `collection_method=charge_automatically`, you might need to bring the customer back on-session to complete SCA. You can do so with our Hosted Invoice Page, or through the custom handling described in the [third scenario](#scenario-3).\n\nIf your application uses the [Pay Invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/pay) endpoint, you either need to start using the Hosted Invoice Page or build custom handling because this endpoint will return an HTTP 402 error when SCA is required. If you choose to build custom handling, you need to use the invoice’s PaymentIntent to drive the payment to completion. You also need to set [off\\_session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/pay#pay_invoice-off_session) when attempting to pay an invoice using the endpoint.\n\nStripe Billing offers a set of prebuilt tools that can automatically handle payments that require 3D Secure authentication.\n\nThis demo shows a sample invoice payment.\n\nYou can choose to have Stripe:\n\n*   Email your customers when an off-session payment requires 3D Secure authentication\n*   Schedule follow-up emails reminding customers to complete authentication\n*   Provide a link to a hosted invoice page where customers can complete authentication\n\nYou can customize emails and the hosted invoice page in your [Branding settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/branding).\n\nThe following table outlines the various actions you or Stripe can take to trigger SCA and whether or not Stripe considers the action on-session or off-session by default. For actions that are off-session, Stripe sends an authentication link if the SCA email setting is enabled.\n\n| Action | Customer presence | Sends SCA email |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Create subscription from the API | On-session | No  |\n| Create subscription from the Dashboard | Off-session | Yes |\n| Update subscription from the API | On-session | No  |\n| Update subscription from the Dashboard | Off-session | Yes |\n| Update customer source | Off-session | Yes |\n| Pay invoice from the API | Off-session | Yes |\n| Pay invoice from the Dashboard | Off-session | Yes |\n| Pay invoice from Hosted invoice page | On-session | No  |\n| Stripe automatically charges scheduled invoice | Off-session | Yes |\n| Stripe dunning | Off-session | Yes |\n\nThe API actions for creating subscriptions, updating subscriptions, and paying invoices also have an `off_session` attribute that you can set manually. Setting this attribute to `true` indicates the payment is off-session, and `false` indicates the payment is on-session.\n\n## Emails and dunning ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nYou can send a [dunning email](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/send-email \"dunning email\") to customers for overdue payments to increase recovery chances. Our suite of customer emails has been updated to include notifications for when 3D Secure authentication is required for off-session payments. This is in addition to support for sending invoices, receipts, and failed payment notifications.\n\n## 3D Secure payment settings ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nYou can schedule when to send 3D Secure emails and you can determine what effect non-payment has on subscriptions. Use the [Billing settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/automatic) in the Stripe Dashboard to configure these settings.\n\n![How to configure your 3D Secure engagement.](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/3ds-settings.e64e0e1fdd9eb5fcdb87eedab14e07bd.png)\n\n### Request for payment authentication using 3D Secure emails ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nA configurable email template is available to automatically send your customers an email asking them to authenticate to complete payment for their invoice or subscription.\n\n![Sample 3D Secure authentication notification.](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/3ds-email.05ee80fdb0e4873670106b982c986c3f.png)\n\n## Hosted Invoice Page ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nStripe Billing provides a [Hosted Invoice Page](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/hosted-invoice-page) that supports all invoices. To support SCA requirements, this page can now manage [3D Secure](https://stripe.com/guides/3d-secure-2) authentication.\n\nIf an off-session payment requires the customer to complete 3D Secure authentication, you can send them a link to a hosted invoice page. On the hosted invoice page, the customer can confirm their payment or add a new payment method if one is needed. After confirming their payment, the customer can complete authentication with their bank using a 3D Secure 2 modal that is displayed.\n\n## SCA exemptions ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nThe SCA regulation contains a [set of exemptions](https://stripe.com/guides/strong-customer-authentication#exemptions-to-strong-customer-authentication). These exemptions mean that your customers might not need to provide additional authentication to confirm some payments. Stripe’s goal is to optimize your payment flow and attempt to automatically apply as many exemptions as possible in order to reduce the likelihood of your customers needing to authenticate.\n\n## Summary of API changes ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nThe API contains several updates to help manage SCA requirements and the authentication flow.\n\n### Subscription statuses ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nTwo [statuses](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/overview#subscription-lifecycle) have been added to the Subscription resource: `incomplete` and `incomplete_expired`. Subscriptions enter the `incomplete` status only when the first charge is attempted and either fails or requires SCA. Any subscription that remains in the `incomplete` state and is not successfully paid expires after 23 hours. This automatically changes the status to `incomplete_expired`. After a subscription is `active` it cannot enter `incomplete` again. Future payments that require SCA result in the subscription being `past_due`.\n\n#### Note\n\nUsers on API version [2019-03-14](https://docs.stripe.com/upgrades#2019-03-14) or newer automatically have access to this functionality. If you’re on an older API version, you need to use the [payment\\_behavior](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/create#create_subscription-payment_behavior) flag to use these new statuses.\n\n### Subscriptions reference their latest invoice ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nThe subscription’s `latest_invoice` field provides a reference to the invoice affecting the status of a subscription. This change is additive to all API versions.\n\n### All invoices use PaymentIntents for payment ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nThe [Payment Intents API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents) is Stripe’s new payment API that manages the lifecycle of a payment. This includes a new `requires_action` payment status and a `next_action` attribute. These additions indicate how to complete payment, which is usually done through a redirect to the cardholder’s bank for authentication or using a URL embedded within the response. The Invoice object now has a `payment_intent` you can use to manage the payment lifecycle, in addition to the existing `charge` attribute.\n\nThis change is additive to all API versions and is backwards compatible. You can still use the `charge` attribute to manage payments, but if your business needs to support SCA and wants future compatibility with other payment methods that require authentication, Stripe recommends using the `payment_intent` attribute.\n\n### Stripe.js support for the Payment Intents API ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nInvoices for Stripe Billing are fully compatible with the Payment Intents API, so you get the benefit of the Stripe.js helper functions to assist with your checkout payment flow. Specifically, the [confirmCardPayment](https://docs.stripe.com/js#stripe-confirm-card-payment) JavaScript function helps you display a 3D Secure modal to collect the authentication information needed to complete payment. This change is only relevant if you use PaymentIntents.\n\n### An invoice.payment\\_action\\_required webhook is sent when SCA is required ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nWhen an invoice requires customer action, Stripe sends a new `invoice.payment_action_required` webhook containing the associated invoice. This webhook is meant to complement existing `invoice.paid` and `invoice.payment_failed` webhooks. This change is additive to all API versions. Existing Stripe Billing users that are not concerned with SCA can ignore this webhook.\n\n### Subscriptions reference SetupIntents for collecting authentication ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nSubscription’s now have a `pending_setup_intent` attribute that references a SetupIntent. This SetupIntent can be used to collect authentication while customers are on-session, which optimizes off-session payments. This change is additive to all API versions.\n\n## Frequently asked questions (FAQ) ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\n*   **Does SCA apply to my business?**\n    \n    Strong [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers \"Customers\") Authentication (SCA) regulations apply to online payments where the cardholder’s bank and the business’s payment provider are both in the European Economic Area (EEA). Read more in the [Strong Customer Authentication Overview](https://docs.stripe.com/strong-customer-authentication).\n    \n*   **What payment methods require SCA?**\n    \n    Strong Customer Authentication will apply to [“customer-initiated” online payments within Europe](https://stripe.com/guides/strong-customer-authentication#when-is-strong-customer-authentication-required). As a result, most card payments and all bank transfers will require SCA. The major integration changes that are required pertain to cards, as documented in this guide. Bank transfers won’t require an integration change because it’s up to the customer’s bank to authenticate transfers using their existing online bank interface.\n    \n*   **What happens if I don’t upgrade my integration, or start passing the payment\\_behavior flag?**\n    \n    Calls to create or update subscriptions that result in charges requiring SCA will fail with an HTTP 402 error. Similarly, calls to the [Pay Invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/pay) endpoint will fail. As a result you might experience an overall increase in payment failures.\n    \n*   **How can I use the new subscription behavior without upgrading my API version?**\n    \n    Assuming that updating your API version is not an option, you should use the [payment\\_behavior=allow\\_incomplete](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/create#create_subscription-payment_behavior) flag. Since payments can be initiated during subscription updates as well as subscription creation, you should pass this flag to all `subscription` and `subscription_item` creation or update calls. Below is a list of endpoints this flag applies to.\n    \n    *   [Create Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/create)\n    *   [Update Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/update)\n    *   [Create Subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/create)\n    *   [Update Subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/update)\n    *   [Update Subscription Item](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscription_items)\n    \n    For creating and updating customers, the `payment_behavior` flag is only supported when subscribing a customer using an the API request. Creating and updating subscriptions using the Customer object is no longer documented, but the APIs are still supported for legacy reasons.\n    \n*   **How often will SCA be required and when will I be able to rely on exemptions?**\n    \n    For subscriptions, Stripe is working to optimize the exemptions claimed on your behalf. SCA will systematically be applied to the first charge in a subscription where both the merchant and the customer are located in the EEA. Subsequent charges could be subject to exemptions. For one-off invoices and charges, Stripe will apply for exemptions on your behalf when possible.\n    \n    There are a couple of known caveats to [SCA exemptions](https://stripe.com/guides/strong-customer-authentication#exemptions-to-strong-customer-authentication \"SCA exemptions\"):\n    \n    *   Certain card issuing banks don’t support some or all exemption categories, though they may in the future.\n    *   The card issuing bank has an unconditional right to challenge a legitimate exemption request. It is expected this will happen when they assess a transaction as high risk.\n    \n    When considering how to update your integration, plan for SCA every time.\n    \n*   **What is off-session and why is it important?**\n    \n    A payment is off-session if it occurs without the direct involvement of the customer, using previously-collected payment information. Explicitly tagging transactions as off-session allows Stripe to claim exemptions on your behalf. For example, the [merchant-initiated transaction](https://stripe.com/guides/strong-customer-authentication#merchant-initiated-transactions-including-variable-subscriptions \"merchant-initiated transaction\") (MIT) exemption only applies to off-session payments. Claiming this exemption decreases the chance that SCA is required, which reduces the friction on the customer.\n    \n*   **When does Stripe automatically infer on-session and off-session on your behalf?**\n    \n    *   Payments initiated through subscription creation are assumed to be on-session.\n    *   Payments initiated by Stripe’s automated systems, like a payment for a recurring subscription, are considered off-session.\n    *   Payments made using the [Pay Invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/pay) endpoint need to be explicitly tagged as on or off-session using the [off\\_session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/pay#pay_invoice-off_session) attribute. If no value is set, Stripe defaults to `true`.\n    \n\n## SCA Migration Guide changelog ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nBelow is a list of major revisions to this guide.\n\n**2019-07-15**\n\n*   Add content explaining SetupIntents and when to use them\n*   Explain when Stripe automatically determines whether a payment is on or off-session\n*   Explain when and how to set `off_session` on the [Pay Invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/pay) endpoint\n*   Add link to new card for testing SCA\n*   Renamed the `enable_incomplete_payments` flag to [payment\\_behavior](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/create#create_subscription-payment_behavior)\n    *   `payment_behavior` can be set to either `allow_incomplete` or `error_if_incomplete`\n\n**2019-04-15**\n\n*   Publish initial content",

  "markdown": "# Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Prorations\n\n## Manage prorations for modified subscriptions.\n\nThe most complex aspect of changing existing subscriptions is proration, where the customer is charged a percentage of a subscription’s cost to reflect partial use. This page explains how prorations work with subscriptions and how to manage prorations for your customers.\n\n## How prorations work![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nFor example, [upgrading or downgrading](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/upgrade-downgrade) a subscription can result in prorated charges. If a customer upgrades from a 10 USD per month plan to a 20 USD option, they’re charged prorated amounts for the time spent on each option. Assuming the change occurred halfway through the billing period, the customer is billed an additional 5 USD: -5 USD for unused time on the initial price, and 10 USD for the remaining time on the new price.\n\nProration ensures that customers are billed accurately, but a proration can result in different payment amounts than you may expect. Negative prorations aren’t automatically refunded and positive prorations aren’t immediately billed, although you can do both manually.\n\nYou can [preview a proration](#preview-proration) to view the amount before applying the changes.\n\n### Prorations and discounts![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nWhen applying changes to existing subscriptions, [discounts](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/coupons) don’t affect the resulting proration line items.\n\n### What triggers prorations![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nBy default, the following scenarios result in a proration:\n\n*   Changing to a price with a different base cost\n*   Changing to a price with a different billing interval\n*   Adding a trial period to an active subscription\n*   Changing the quantity\n*   [Licensed](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/quantities) (per-seat) subscriptions (because they’re billed at the start of each billing period)\n\n### When prorations are applied![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nProrations only apply to charges that occur ahead of the billing cycle. [Usage-based billing](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/usage-based) isn’t subject to proration.\n\nThe prorated amount is calculated as soon as the API updates the subscription. The current billing period’s start and end times are used to calculate the cost of the subscription before and after the change.\n\n### Taxes and prorations![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nFor information about how taxes work with prorations, see [Collect taxes for recurring payments](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/taxes/collect-taxes).\n\n## Preview a proration ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nYou can [retrieve an upcoming invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/api#upcoming_invoice) to preview changes to a subscription. This API call doesn’t modify the subscription, it returns the upcoming [invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices \"invoices\") based only on the parameters that you pass. Changing the `price` or `quantity` both result in a proration. This example changes the `price` and sets a date for the proration.\n\n`# Set your secret key.

Because Stripe prorates to the second, prorated amounts may change between the time they’re previewed and the time the update is made. To avoid this, pass in a `subscription_proration_date` to the invoice when you preview a change. When you update the subscription, pass the same date using the `proration_date` parameter on a subscription so that the proration is calculated at the same time.\n\n`# Set your secret key.

No parameter turns off all future prorations for a Subscription. To disable prorations indefinitely, set `proration_behavior` to `none` for every request that generates prorations:\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/subscriptions/sub_49ty4767H20z6a \\   -u` \n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`: \\   -d \"items[0][id]\"=\"si_1AkFf6LlRB0eXbMtRFjYiJ0J\" \\   -d \"items[0][price]\"=\"price_CBb6IXqvTLXp3f\" \\   -d \"proration_behavior\"=\"none\"`\n\nWhen prorations are disabled, customers are billed the full amount at the new price when the next invoice is generated.",

Upselling customers to longer subscription intervals (for example, from monthly to yearly) can increase your average order value and cash flow.\n\nAll recurring prices that aren’t metered are eligible to use subscription upsells. For any eligible price, you can set up a subscription upsell to another price that meets the following criteria:\n\n*   Prices must reference the same [Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices/object#price_object-product).\n*   Prices must have the same [currency](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices/object#price_object-currency).\n*   Prices must be `recurring` [type](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices/object#price_object-type).\n*   If your prices use [tax behavior](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices/object#price_object-tax_behavior), their values must be identical.\n*   If your price uses [tiers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices/object#price_object-tiers), the value for `up_to` in each tier must be identical.\n*   If using [quantity transformation](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices/object#price_object-transform_quantity), the values for `divide_by` and `round` must be identical.\n\n## Create a subscription upsell ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nConfigure a subscription upsell in the Dashboard on the Price detail page (to view the details for a Price, click on a Product, then click a price that’s been added to a Product). In the Upsells section, select an upsell price from the dropdown menu. Upsells immediately apply to eligible Checkout Sessions that use that price.\n\n![Configure a subscription upsell on the Price detail page](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/add-upsell.08bc9bf9425295edb1ada9ff297ee257.gif)\n\nConfigure a subscription upsell on the Price detail page.\n\n## Checkout experience ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nDuring checkout, customers see an option to select the upsell with savings displayed, if applicable. For a Checkout Session to be eligible for upsells, it must:\n\n*   Be a subscription mode Checkout Session\n*   Have only one `type=recurring` price in the Checkout Session\n*   Have a valid configuration for the upsell price\n\nStripe calculates savings based on the amount the user would save in one billing cycle if they chose upsell pricing. For example, a monthly subscription of 100 USD that upsells to an annual subscription of 1000 USD shows savings of 200 USD. Savings are displayed as an amount or a percentage, depending on the character length of the savings.\n\nUsers can toggle between the initial price option and the upsell price option and then checkout.\n\n![Toggle between the initial price option and the upsell price option](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/upsell-preview.2a43c1a8acb9f167178b7fda6a2b0796.gif)\n\nCustomer preview.\n\n## Retrieve Checkout Session line items ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nAfter a customer selects an upsell, the `line_items` for the Checkout Session update to reflect the upsell price. When [fulfilling your order](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/fulfillment#create-payment-event-handler) using the `checkout.session.completed` webhook, make sure to [retrieve the line items](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/line_items).\n\n## Trial behavior ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nIf a customer selects an upsell for a Checkout Session with a trial available, the trial length won’t change.\n\n## Coupon behavior ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nIf a coupon is passed into the [discounts](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-discounts) array of the Checkout Session, that coupon is also applied to the upsell price if a customer selects the upsell. For example, if a monthly subscription upsells to a yearly subscription, and you pass in a 50% off coupon with a duration of four months, the discount applies to all invoices in the four month period starting when the coupon is first applied. If the upsell is selected, the 50% discount applies to the entire yearly subscription because the yearly invoice is created during the coupon’s four month period.\n\n## Remove a subscription upsell ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nTo remove a subscription upsell, click the **x** below. After you remove a subscription upsell, that upsell won’t be available to any new Checkout Sessions.\n\n![Remove an upsell](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/remove-upsell.36e5e59619f3c13f0aa94a3bd48bafdb.gif)\n\nRemove an upsell.",

  "markdown": "# Prices | Stripe API Reference\n\nPrices define the unit cost, currency, and (optional) billing cycle for both recurring and one-time purchases of products.

  "markdown": "# Manage products and prices | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Learn how to manage products and prices.\n\nYou can create and update products and prices in the Dashboard or through the API.\n\nSome advanced use cases, like [creating variable prices](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/pricing-models#variable-pricing), require you to use the API. If you have a large number of products and prices or if you’re [building a custom integration](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/build-subscriptions?ui=elements) with Elements, you need to use the API.\n\n*   Use the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/products) to create and manage products and prices if you want to avoid writing code or if you only have a few products and prices. Set up your [pricing model](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/pricing-models \"pricing model\") in test mode and click the **Copy to live mode** button on the product details page.\n*   Use the [API](https://docs.stripe.com/api) or the [Stripe CLI](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-cli) to create and manage products and prices. The API is a direct method that you use for production implementations. The Stripe CLI is a developer tool that helps you build, test, and manage your integration with Stripe directly from your terminal.\n\nThe following API steps use a fictional SaaS collaboration tool (Togethere) as an example, where the basic product is a project management dashboard.\n\n[](#create-product)\n\n### Create a product and price ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\n#### Create a product![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nTo create a product in the Dashboard:\n\n1.  Go to **More** > **Product catalog**.\n2.  Click **+Add product**.\n3.  Enter the **Name** of your product.\n4.  _(Optional)_ Add a **Description**. The description appears at checkout, on the [customer portal](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management), and in [quotes](https://docs.stripe.com/quotes).\n5.  _(Optional)_ Add an **Image** of your product. Use a JPEG, PNG, or WEBP file that’s smaller than 2MB. The image appears at checkout.\n6.  _(Optional)_ If you’re using [Stripe Tax](https://docs.stripe.com/tax), select a **Tax code** for your product. See [tax codes](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-codes) for more information about the appropriate category for your product.\n7.  _(Optional)_ Enter a **Statement descriptor**. This descriptor overrides any account descriptors for recurring payments. Choose something that your customers would recognize on a bank statement.\n8.  _(Optional)_ Enter a **Unit label**. This describes how you sell your product. For example, if you charge by the seat, enter “seat” so the line item includes “per seat” for the price. Unit labels appear at checkout, and in invoices, receipts, and the [customer portal](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/customer-portal \"customer portal\").\n\n#### Create a price for the product ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nTo save a product in the Dashboard, you must also add at least one price.\n\nThe product editor shows the flat-rate pricing model by default. You can create multiple prices or use a different pricing model with the **Advanced pricing options**.\n\n1.  Select a **Pricing model**. For more details about recurring pricing models, read the [pricing model guide](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/pricing-models).\n    \n    *   **Flat-rate pricing**: Charge the same price for each unit. If you use this option, select **One time** or **Recurring**.\n    *   **Package pricing**: Charge by the package, or group of units, such as charging 25 USD for every 5 units. Purchases are rounded up by default, so a customer buying 8 units pays 50 USD.\n    *   **Graduated pricing**: Use pricing tiers that might result in a different price for some units in an order. For example, you might charge 10 USD per unit for the first 100 units and then 5 USD per unit for the next 50. If you use this option, select the currency for the price and fill in the tier table.\n    *   **Volume pricing**: Charge the same price for each unit based on the total number of units sold. For example, you might charge 10 USD per unit for 50 units, and 7 USD per unit for 100 units. If you use this option, select the currency for the price and fill in the tier table.\n    \n    *   **Customer chooses price**: Let the payer decide on the amount to pay for your product, service, or cause. **Customer chooses price** is only compatible with Checkout and Payment Links.\n    \n    *   **Usage-based pricing**: Charge your customers based on how much of your service they use during the billing cycle.\n2.  _(Optional)_ If you’re selling in multiple currencies, click **Add another currency** to set how much to charge in each currency.\n    \n3.  Select a **Billing period** for recurring prices. You can add a custom period if none of the drop-down options are what you want.\n    \n4.  Select whether to **Include tax in price**. Learn more about [taxes and subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/taxes).\n    \n5.  _(Optional)_ Enter a **Price description**. Customers don’t see this description.\n    \n6.  _(Optional)_ Click **Advanced pricing options** if you want to create multiple prices for your product.\n7.  Click **Add product** to save the product and price. You can [edit both](#edit-product) later.\n\n[](#edit-product)\n\nTo modify a product in the Dashboard:\n\n1.  Go to **More** > **Product catalog**.\n2.  Find the product you want to modify, click the overflow menu (), then click **Edit product**.\n3.  Make your changes to the product.\n4.  Click **Save product**.\n\nYou can also edit products from within the product information page by clicking the overflow menu () or **Edit**.\n\n[](#archive-product)\n\nIf you want to disable a product so that it can’t be added to new invoices or subscriptions, you can archive it. If you archive a product, any existing subscriptions that use the product remain active until they’re canceled and any existing payment links that use the product are deactivated. You can’t delete products that have an associated price, but you can archive them.\n\nTo archive a product:\n\n1.  Go to **More** > **Product catalog**.\n2.  Find the product you want to modify, click the overflow menu (), then click **Archive product**.\n\nTo unarchive a product:\n\n1.  Go to the **Archived** tab on the **Product catalog**\\>**Overview** page.\n2.  Find the product you want to modify, click the overflow menu (), then click **Unarchive product**.\n\nYou can also unarchive a product from the product information page.\n\n[](#delete-product)\n\nYou can only delete products that have no prices associated with them. Alternatively, you can [archive a product](#archive-product).\n\nIf a product has a price associated with it, you have to [delete](#delete-price) or [archive](#archive-price) the price before you can delete the product. Stripe keeps a record of the price and product for historical transactions.\n\nTo permanently delete a product:\n\n1.  Go to **More** > **Product catalog**.\n2.  Find the product you want to modify, click the overflow menu (), then click **Delete product**.\n\n[](#create-price)\n\nYou can create single or multiple prices for a product. For example, Togethere may have a “starter” level offered at 10 USD per month, 100 USD per year, or 9 EUR as a one-time purchase.\n\n#### Note\n\nAfter you create a price, you can only update its `metadata`, `nickname`, and `active` fields.\n\nTo create a price in the Dashboard, you have to [create a product](#create-product) first. Then you can create a price:\n\n1.  Select a **Pricing model**. For more details about recurring pricing models, read the [pricing model guide](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/pricing-models).\n    \n    *   **Flat-rate pricing**: Charge the same price for each unit. If you use this option, select **One time** or **Recurring**.\n    *   **Package pricing**: Charge by the package, or group of units, such as charging 25 USD for every 5 units.

Learn more about [taxes and subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/taxes).\n    \n5.  _(Optional)_ Enter a **Price description**. Customers don’t see this description.\n    \n6.  Click **Create price** to save the price. You can [edit the price](#edit-price) later.\n\n### Set a default price ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nA product’s default price is the most common price you want to present to customers. For example, a product could have multiple prices for seasonal sales, but the default is the regular (non-sale) price. If your product only has one price, that is its default price. The default price must be an [active](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices/object#price_object-active) Price.\n\nTo change your product’s default price in the Dashboard:\n\n1.  Go to **More** > **Product catalog**.\n2.  Find the product you want to modify, click the overflow menu (), then click **Edit product**.\n3.  Under the **Price information** section, find the price you want to set as the new default price, then click **Set as default price**.\n4.  Click **Save product**.\n\nTo create a new price and make it the new default price in the Dashboard:\n\n1.  Go to **More** > **Product catalog**.\n2.  Find the product you want to modify and click on it to open the product information page.\n3.  In the **Pricing** section, click the **Add another price** button.\n4.  Enter your pricing details and select **Set as default price**. Read more about the fields available when you [create a price](#create-price).\n5.  Click **Add price**.\n\n### Lookup keys ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nMost businesses display pricing information on their website. If these prices are hard-coded and you want to change them, the process is often manual and requires you to deploy new code. To better manage these scenarios, you can use the [lookup\\_key](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices/create#create_price-lookup_key) attribute on the [Price object](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices/object#price_object). This key allows you to:\n\n*   Render different prices in your frontend.\n*   Use the rendered price to bill customers.\n\nYou can pass a `lookup_key` when you create a price:\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/prices \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d product=  {{PRODUCT_ID}}   \\  -d unit_amount=1000 \\  -d currency=usd \\  -d \"recurring[interval]\"=month \\  -d lookup_key=standard_monthly`\n\nInstead of hard-coding text like **10 USD per month** on your pricing page and using a price ID on your backend, you can query for the price using the `standard_monthly` key and then render that in your frontend:\n\n`curl -G https://api.stripe.com/v1/prices \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d \"lookup_keys[]\"=standard_monthly`\n\n#### Note\n\nTo optimize performance, you might want to add a caching layer to only reload the price occasionally.\n\nWhen a customer clicks your subscribe or pay button, you pass the price from the `GET` request above into the Subscriptions API.\n\nNow that you can render different prices, if you decide that you want to start charging new users 20 USD per month rather than 10 USD per month, you only need to create a new price and transfer the lookup key to that new price using [transfer\\_lookup\\_key=true](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices/create#create_price-transfer_lookup_key):\n\n#### Rounding ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nRounding occurs on the line item level of your [invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices \"invoices\"). For example, if you create a price with `unit_amount_decimal = 0.05` and a monthly subscription for that \\[price\\] with `quantity = 30`, rounding occurs after multiplying the quantity by the decimal amount. In this case, the calculated amount for the line item would be `0.05 * 30 = 1.5`, which rounds up to 2 cents. If you have multiple line items, each is rounded up before summing up the total amount for the invoice. This ensures that customers are still charged an integer minor unit amount, as decimal amounts only apply for pricing.\n\nExclusive taxes are added to each line item amount, depending on the tax rate. If you enable [automatic taxes](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/invoicing), exclusive taxes are applied and rounded on the total of the invoice, including invoice level discounts. If you use manual taxes on either the line item level or the invoice level, you can choose how to apply rounding. Use the [invoice settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/invoice) page in the Dashboard to apply and round taxes for each line item, or apply and round taxes on the invoice subtotal.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/prices \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d product=  {{PRODUCT_ID}}   \\  -d unit_amount=2000 \\  -d currency=usd \\  -d \"recurring[interval]\"=month \\  -d lookup_key=standard_monthly \\  -d transfer_lookup_key=true`\n\n[](#edit-price)\n\nMultiple properties can be updated on a price, either in the Dashboard or the API. For example, you can change whether the price is active, or modify its metadata.\n\nNote that you can not change a price’s amount in the API. Instead, we recommend creating a new price for the new amount, switch to the new price’s ID, then update the old price to be inactive.\n\nTo modify a price in the Dashboard:\n\n1.  Go to **More** > **Product catalog**.\n2.  Find the product for the price you want to modify, and click on it\n3.  Find the price you want to modify, click the overflow menu (), then click **Edit price**.\n4.  Make your changes to the price. You can add another price at this point.\n5.  Click **Save**.\n\n[](#archive-price)\n\nIf you want to disable a price so that it can’t be added to new invoices or subscriptions, you can archive it. If you archive a price, any existing subscriptions that use the price remain active until they’re canceled and any existing payment links that use the product are deactivated.\n\nTo archive a price through the Dashboard:\n\n1.  Go to **More** > **Product catalog**.\n2.  Find the product you want to modify, click the overflow menu ().\n3.  On the product information page, find the price you want to modify, then click the overflow menu () next to it and click **Archive price**.\n\nTo unarchive a price:\n\n1.  Go to **More** > **Product catalog**.\n2.  Find the product you want to modify, click the overflow menu ().\n3.  On the product information page, find the price you want to modify, then click the overflow menu () next to it and click **Unarchive price**.\n\n[](#delete-price)\n\nYou can only delete prices that you’ve never used. Otherwise, you can [archive them](#archive-price).\n\nTo permanently delete a price in the Dashboard:\n\n1.  Go to **More** > **Product catalog**.\n2.  Find the product you want to modify, click the overflow menu ().\n3.  On the product information page, find the price you want to modify, then click the overflow menu () next to it and click **Delete price**.\n\n[](#pricing-table)\n\nAfter creating products and prices, you can embed a [pricing table](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/pricing-table) on your website to display pricing information to your customers. When customers choose a subscription option, they’re taken directly to checkout. Configure, customize, and update directly in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/pricing-tables) without writing any code.",

This can be a customer ID, a cart ID, or similar, and can be used to reconcile the session with your internal systems.\n    \n*   ID of an existing Customer, if one exists. In `payment` mode, the customer’s most recently saved card payment method will be used to prefill the email, name, card details, and billing address on the Checkout page. In `subscription` mode, the customer’s [default payment method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/update#update_customer-invoice_settings-default_payment_method) will be used if it’s a card, otherwise the most recently saved card will be used. A valid billing address, billing name and billing email are required on the payment method for Checkout to prefill the customer’s card details.\n    \n    If the Customer already has a valid [email](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-email) set, the email will be prefilled and not editable in Checkout. If the Customer does not have a valid `email`, Checkout will set the email entered during the session on the Customer.\n    \n    If blank for Checkout Sessions in `subscription` mode or with `customer_creation` set as `always` in `payment` mode, Checkout will create a new Customer object based on information provided during the payment flow.\n    \n    You can set [`payment_intent_data.setup_future_usage`](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-payment_intent_data-setup_future_usage) to have Checkout automatically attach the payment method to the Customer you pass in for future reuse.\n    \n*   If provided, this value will be used when the Customer object is created. If not provided, customers will be asked to enter their email address. Use this parameter to prefill customer data if you already have an email on file. To access information about the customer once a session is complete, use the `customer` field.\n    \n*   #### \n    \n    line\\_itemsarray of objectsRequired unless setup mode\n    \n    A list of items the customer is purchasing. Use this parameter to pass one-time or recurring [Prices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices).\n    \n    For `payment` mode, there is a maximum of 100 line items, however it is recommended to consolidate line items if there are more than a few dozen.\n    \n    For `subscription` mode, there is a maximum of 20 line items with recurring Prices and 20 line items with one-time Prices. Line items with one-time Prices will be on the initial invoice only.\n    \n*   Set of [key-value pairs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/metadata) that you can attach to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format. Individual keys can be unset by posting an empty value to them. All keys can be unset by posting an empty value to `metadata`.\n    \n*   The mode of the Checkout Session. Pass `subscription` if the Checkout Session includes at least one recurring item.\n    \n    Possible enum values\n    \n    |     |\n    | --- |\n    | `payment`<br><br>Accept one-time payments for cards, iDEAL, and more. |\n    | `setup`<br><br>Save payment details to charge your customers later. |\n    | `subscription`<br><br>Use Stripe Billing to set up fixed-price subscriptions. |\n    \n*   #### \n    \n    return\\_urlstringRequired conditionally\n    \n    The URL to redirect your customer back to after they authenticate or cancel their payment on the payment method’s app or site. This parameter is required if ui\\_mode is `embedded` and redirect-based payment methods are enabled on the session.\n    \n*   #### \n    \n    success\\_urlstringRequired conditionally\n    \n    The URL to which Stripe should send customers when payment or setup is complete. This parameter is not allowed if ui\\_mode is `embedded`. If you’d like to use information from the successful Checkout Session on your page, read the guide on [customizing your success page](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/custom-success-page).\n

  "markdown": "# Create a Session | Stripe API Reference\n\nCreates a Session object.\n\n### Parameters\n\n*   #### \n    \n    client\\_reference\\_idstring\n    \n    A unique string to reference the Checkout Session. This can be a customer ID, a cart ID, or similar, and can be used to reconcile the session with your internal systems.\n    \n*   ID of an existing Customer, if one exists. In `payment` mode, the customer’s most recently saved card payment method will be used to prefill the email, name, card details, and billing address on the Checkout page. In `subscription` mode, the customer’s [default payment method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/update#update_customer-invoice_settings-default_payment_method) will be used if it’s a card, otherwise the most recently saved card will be used. A valid billing address, billing name and billing email are required on the payment method for Checkout to prefill the customer’s card details.\n    \n    If the Customer already has a valid [email](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-email) set, the email will be prefilled and not editable in Checkout. If the Customer does not have a valid `email`, Checkout will set the email entered during the session on the Customer.\n    \n    If blank for Checkout Sessions in `subscription` mode or with `customer_creation` set as `always` in `payment` mode, Checkout will create a new Customer object based on information provided during the payment flow.\n    \n    You can set [`payment_intent_data.setup_future_usage`](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-payment_intent_data-setup_future_usage) to have Checkout automatically attach the payment method to the Customer you pass in for future reuse.\n    \n*   If provided, this value will be used when the Customer object is created. If not provided, customers will be asked to enter their email address. Use this parameter to prefill customer data if you already have an email on file. To access information about the customer once a session is complete, use the `customer` field.\n    \n*   #### \n    \n    line\\_itemsarray of objectsRequired unless setup mode\n    \n    A list of items the customer is purchasing. Use this parameter to pass one-time or recurring [Prices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices).\n    \n    For `payment` mode, there is a maximum of 100 line items, however it is recommended to consolidate line items if there are more than a few dozen.\n    \n    For `subscription` mode, there is a maximum of 20 line items with recurring Prices and 20 line items with one-time Prices. Line items with one-time Prices will be on the initial invoice only.\n    \n*   Set of [key-value pairs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/metadata) that you can attach to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format. Individual keys can be unset by posting an empty value to them. All keys can be unset by posting an empty value to `metadata`.\n    \n*   The mode of the Checkout Session. Pass `subscription` if the Checkout Session includes at least one recurring item.\n    \n    Possible enum values\n    \n    |     |\n    | --- |\n    | `payment`<br><br>Accept one-time payments for cards, iDEAL, and more. |\n    | `setup`<br><br>Save payment details to charge your customers later. |\n    | `subscription`<br><br>Use Stripe Billing to set up fixed-price subscriptions. |\n    \n*   #### \n    \n    return\\_urlstringRequired conditionally\n    \n    The URL to redirect your customer back to after they authenticate or cancel their payment on the payment method’s app or site. This parameter is required if ui\\_mode is `embedded` and redirect-based payment methods are enabled on the session.\n    \n*   #### \n    \n    success\\_urlstringRequired conditionally\n    \n    The URL to which Stripe should send customers when payment or setup is complete. This parameter is not allowed if ui\\_mode is `embedded`. If you’d like to use information from the successful Checkout Session on your page, read the guide on [customizing your success page](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/custom-success-page).\n    \n\n### More parameters\n\n*   #### \n    \n    allow\\_promotion\\_codesboolean\n    \n\n*   #### \n    \n    billing\\_address\\_collectionenum\n    \n\n*   #### \n    \n    currencyenumRequired

You must use `return_url`. Learn more about [customizing redirect behavior](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/custom-redirect-behavior) for integrations with the embedded form.\n\n## Redirect customers to a success page ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nYou can use the details from a [Checkout Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions) to display an order confirmation page for your customer (for example, their name or payment amount) after the payment. To use the details from a Checkout Session:\n\n1.  Modify the `success_url` [parameter](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-success_url) to pass the Checkout Session ID to the client side.\n2.  Look up the Checkout Session using the ID on your success page.\n3.  Use the Checkout Session to customize what’s displayed on your success page.\n\n## Modify the success URL Server-side![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nAdd the `{CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}` template variable to the `success_url` when you create the Checkout Session. Note that this is a literal string and must be added exactly as you see it here. Do not substitute it with a Checkout Session ID—this happens automatically after your customer pays and is redirected to the success page.\n\n## Create the success page Server-side![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nLook up the Checkout Session using the ID and create a success page to display the order information. This example prints out the customer’s name:\n\n`# This example sets up an endpoint using the Sinatra framework. # Watch this video to get started: [https://youtu.be/8aA9Enb8NVc.](https://youtu.be/8aA9Enb8NVc)  # Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production. # See your keys here: [https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys) Stripe.api_key =` \n\n`'sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc'`\n\n`require 'sinatra'  get '/order/success' do   session = Stripe::Checkout::Session.retrieve(params[:session_id])   customer = Stripe::Customer.retrieve(session.customer)    \"<html><body><h1>Thanks for your order, #{customer.name}!</h1></body></html>\" end`\n\n## Test the integration![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nTo confirm that your redirect is working as expected:\n\n1.  Click the checkout button.\n2.  Fill in the customer name and other payment details.\n3.  Click **Pay**.\n\nIf it works, you’re redirected to the success page with your custom message. For example, if you used the message in the code samples, the success page displays this message: **Thanks for your order, Jenny Rosen!**",

  "markdown": "# Create a portal session | Stripe API Reference\n\nCreates a session of the customer portal.\n\n### Parameters\n\n*   The ID of an existing customer.\n    \n*   The ID of an existing [configuration](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customer_portal/configuration) to use for this session, describing its functionality and features. If not specified, the session uses the default configuration.\n    \n*   Information about a specific flow for the customer to go through. See the [docs](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management/portal-deep-links) to learn more about using customer portal deep links and flows.\n    \n*   The IETF language tag of the locale customer portal is displayed in. If blank or auto, the customer’s `preferred_locales` or browser’s locale is used.\n    \n*   #### \n    \n    on\\_behalf\\_ofstringConnect only\n    \n    The `on_behalf_of` account to use for this session. When specified, only subscriptions and invoices with this `on_behalf_of` account appear in the portal. For more information, see the [docs](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers#settlement-merchant). Use the [Accounts API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-settings-branding) to modify the `on_behalf_of` account’s branding settings, which the portal displays.\n    \n*   The default URL to redirect customers to when they click on the portal’s link to return to your website.\n    \n\n### Returns\n\nReturns a portal session object.\n\nPOST /v1/billing\\_portal/sessions\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/billing_portal/sessions \\  -u \"sk_test_4eC39Hq...arjtT1zdp7dcsk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc:\" \\  -d customer=cus_NciAYcXfLnqBoz \\  --data-urlencode return_url=\"https://example.com/account\"\n```\n\n```\n{  \"id\": \"bps_1MrSjzLkdIwHu7ixex0IvU9b\",  \"object\": \"billing_portal.session\",  \"configuration\": \"bpc_1MAhNDLkdIwHu7ixckACO1Jq\",  \"created\": 1680210639,  \"customer\": \"cus_NciAYcXfLnqBoz\",  \"flow\": null,  \"livemode\": false,  \"locale\": null,  \"on_behalf_of\": null,  \"return_url\": \"https://example.com/account\",  \"url\": \"https://billing.stripe.com/p/session/test_YWNjdF8xTTJKVGtMa2RJd0h1N2l4LF9OY2lBYjJXcHY4a2NPck96UjBEbFVYRnU5bjlwVUF50100BUtQs3bl\"}\n```\n\n## [Invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices)\n\nInvoices are statements of amounts owed by a customer, and are either generated one-off, or generated periodically from a subscription.\n\nThey contain [invoice items](#invoiceitems), and proration adjustments that may be caused by subscription upgrades/downgrades (if necessary).\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed through automatic charges, Stripe automatically finalizes your invoice and attempts payment. Note that finalizing the invoice, [when automatic](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/automatic-advancement-collection), does not happen immediately as the invoice is created. Stripe waits until one hour after the last webhook was successfully sent (or the last webhook timed out after failing). If you (and the platforms you may have connected to) have no webhooks configured, Stripe waits one hour after creation to finalize the invoice.\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed by sending an email, then based on your [email settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/billing/automatic), Stripe will email the invoice to your customer and await payment. These emails can contain a link to a hosted page to pay the invoice.\n\nStripe applies any customer credit on the account before determining the amount due for the invoice (i.e., the amount that will be actually charged). If the amount due for the invoice is less than Stripe’s [minimum allowed charge per currency](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts), the invoice is automatically marked paid, and we add the amount due to the customer’s credit balance which is applied to the next invoice.\n\nMore details on the customer’s credit balance are [here](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/customer/balance).\n\nRelated guide: [Send invoices to customers](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/invoices/sending)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create)[POST/v1/invoices/create\\_preview](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create_preview)[POST/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/lines/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_line)[GET/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/retrieve)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming)[GET/v1/invoices/:id/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming_invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/list)[DELETE/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/delete)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/add\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/add_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/remove\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/remove_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/update\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/finalize](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/finalize)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/mark\\_uncollectible](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/mark_uncollectible)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/pay](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/pay)[GET/v1/invoices/search](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/search)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/send](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/send)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/void](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/void)\n\n## [Meter Events](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event)\n\nA billing meter event represents a customer’s usage of a product. Meter events are used to bill a customer based on their usage. Meter events are associated with billing meters, which define the shape of the event’s payload and how those events are aggregated for billing.\n\n## [Meter Event Adjustment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_adjustment)\n\nA billing meter event adjustment is a resource that allows you to cancel a meter event. For example, you might create a billing meter event adjustment to cancel a meter event that was created in error or attached to the wrong customer.\n\n## [Meter Event Summary](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_summary)\n\nA billing meter event summary represents an aggregated view of a customer’s billing meter events within a specified timeframe. It indicates how much usage was accrued by a customer for that period.\n\n## [Plans](https://docs.stripe.com/api/plans)\n\nYou can now model subscriptions more flexibly using the [Prices API](#prices). It replaces the Plans API and is backwards compatible to simplify your migration.\n\nPlans define the base price, currency, and billing cycle for recurring purchases of products. [Products](#products) help you track inventory or provisioning, and plans help you track pricing. Different physical goods or levels of service should be represented by products, and pricing options should be represented by plans. This approach lets you change prices without having to change your provisioning scheme.\n\nFor example, you might have a single “gold” product that has plans for $10/month, $100/year, €9/month, and €90/year.\n\nRelated guides: [Set up a subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/set-up-subscription) and more about [products and prices](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/overview).\n\n## [Tax IDs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_create)[POST/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/create)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_retrieve)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/retrieve)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_list)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/list)[DELETE/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_delete)[DELETE/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/delete)\n\n## [Account Links](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_links)\n\nAccount Links are the means by which a Connect platform grants a connected account permission to access Stripe-hosted applications, such as Connect Onboarding.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect Onboarding](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom/hosted-onboarding)\n\n## [Account Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_sessions)\n\nAn AccountSession allows a Connect platform to grant access to a connected account in Connect embedded components.\n\nWe recommend that you create an AccountSession each time you need to display an embedded component to your user. Do not save AccountSessions to your database as they expire relatively quickly, and cannot be used more than once.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect embedded components](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-connect-embedded-components)\n\n## [Application Fees](https://docs.stripe.com/api/application_fees)\n\nWhen you collect a transaction fee on top of a charge made for your user (using [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)), an `Application Fee` object is created in your account. You can list, retrieve, and refund application fees.\n\nRelated guide: [Collecting application fees](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges#collect-fees)\n\n## [Country Specs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/country_specs)\n\nStripe needs to collect certain pieces of information about each account created. These requirements can differ depending on the account’s country. The Country Specs API makes these rules available to your integration.\n\nYou can also view the information from this API call as [an online guide](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information).\n\n## [Person](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/create)[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/update)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/retrieve)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/list)[DELETE/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/delete)\n\n## [Transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/transfers)\n\nA `Transfer` object is created when you move funds between Stripe accounts as part of Connect.\n\nBefore April 6, 2017, transfers also represented movement of funds from a Stripe account to a card or bank account. This behavior has since been split out into a [Payout](#payout_object) object, with corresponding payout endpoints. For more information, read about the [transfer/payout split](https://docs.stripe.com/transfer-payout-split).\n\nRelated guide: [Creating separate charges and transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n\n## [Secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/secret_management)\n\nSecret Store is an API that allows Stripe Apps developers to securely persist secrets for use by UI Extensions and app backends.\n\nThe primary resource in Secret Store is a `secret`. Other apps can’t view secrets created by an app. Additionally, secrets are scoped to provide further permission control.\n\nAll Dashboard users and the app backend share `account` scoped secrets. Use the `account` scope for secrets that don’t change per-user, like a third-party API key.\n\nA `user` scoped secret is accessible by the app backend and one specific Dashboard user. Use the `user` scope for per-user secrets like per-user OAuth tokens, where different users might have different permissions.\n\nRelated guide: [Store data between page reloads](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/store-auth-data-custom-objects)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[GET/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/list)[POST/v1/apps/secrets/delete](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/delete)[GET/v1/apps/secrets/find](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/find)[POST/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/set)\n\n## [Reviews](https://docs.stripe.com/api/radar/reviews)\n\nReviews can be used to supplement automated fraud detection with human expertise.\n\nLearn more about [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar) and reviewing payments [here](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/reviews).\n\n## [Authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/update)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/list)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/approve](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/approve)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/decline](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/decline)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_create)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/capture](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_capture)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/expire](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_expire)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/finalize\\_amount](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_finalize_amount)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/increment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_increment)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/fraud\\_challenges/respond](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/respond_to_fraud_challenges)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/reverse](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_reverse)\n\n## [Cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/create)[POST/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/update)[GET/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/list)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/deliver](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_deliver)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/fail](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_fail)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/return](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_return)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/ship](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_ship)\n\n## [Physical Bundles](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/physical_bundles)\n\nA Physical Bundle represents the bundle of physical items -

For example, WisePOS E is a TerminalHardwareProduct and a WisePOS E - US and WisePOS E - UK are TerminalHardwareSKUs.\n\n## [Terminal Hardware SKU](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_skus)Preview feature\n\nA TerminalHardwareSKU represents a SKU for Terminal hardware. A SKU is a representation of a product available for purchase, containing information such as the name, price, and images.\n\n## [Transaction Entries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/transaction_entries)\n\nTransactionEntries represent individual units of money movements within a single [Transaction](#transactions).\n\n## [Scheduled Queries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/sigma/scheduled_queries)\n\nIf you have [scheduled a Sigma query](https://docs.stripe.com/sigma/scheduled-queries), you’ll receive a `sigma.scheduled_query_run.created` webhook each time the query runs. The webhook contains a `ScheduledQueryRun` object, which you can use to retrieve the query results.\n\n## [Report Types](https://docs.stripe.com/api/reporting/report_type)\n\nThe Report Type resource corresponds to a particular type of report, such as the “Activity summary” or “Itemized payouts” reports. These objects are identified by an ID belonging to a set of enumerated values. See [API Access to Reports documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/reporting/statements/api) for those Report Type IDs, along with required and optional parameters.\n\nNote that certain report types can only be run based on your live-mode data (not test-mode data), and will error when queried without a [live-mode API key](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#test-live-modes).\n\n## [Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/financial_connections/sessions)\n\nA Financial Connections Session is the secure way to programmatically launch the client-side Stripe.js modal that lets your users link their accounts.\n\n## [Verification Report](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_reports)\n\nA VerificationReport is the result of an attempt to collect and verify data from a user. The collection of verification checks performed is determined from the `type` and `options` parameters used. You can find the result of each verification check performed in the appropriate sub-resource: `document`, `id_number`, `selfie`.\n\nEach VerificationReport contains a copy of any data collected by the user as well as reference IDs which can be used to access collected images through the [FileUpload](https://docs.stripe.com/api/files) API. To configure and create VerificationReports, use the [VerificationSession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_sessions) API.\n\nRelated guide: [Accessing verification results](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verification-sessions#results).\n\n## [Crypto Onramp Quotes](https://docs.stripe.com/api/crypto/onramp_quotes)\n\nCrypto Onramp Quotes are estimated quotes for onramp conversions into all the different cryptocurrencies on different networks. The Quotes API allows you to display quotes in your product UI before directing the user to the onramp widget.\n\nRelated guide: [Quotes API](https://docs.stripe.com/crypto/quotes-api)\n\n## [Climate Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/climate/product)\n\nA Climate product represents a type of carbon removal unit available for reservation. You can retrieve it to see the current price and availability.\n\n## [Forwarding Request](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/request)\n\nInstructs Stripe to make a request on your behalf using the destination URL. The destination URL is activated by Stripe at the time of onboarding. Stripe verifies requests with your credentials provided during onboarding, and injects card details from the payment\\_method into the request.\n\nStripe redacts all sensitive fields and headers, including authentication credentials and card numbers, before storing the request and response data in the forwarding Request object, which are subject to a 30-day retention period.\n\nYou can provide a Stripe idempotency key to make sure that requests with the same key result in only one outbound request. The Stripe idempotency key provided should be unique and different from any idempotency keys provided on the underlying third-party request.\n\nForwarding Requests are synchronous requests that return a response or time out according to Stripe’s limits.\n\nRelated guide: [Forward card details to third-party API endpoints](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/forwarding).\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/create)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/retrieve)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/list)",

  "markdown": "# Collect taxes in Checkout | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\nStripe offers two ways to calculate tax on your Checkout Sessions: Stripe Tax and Tax Rates.\n\nStripe Tax allows you to calculate the tax on your one-time and recurring payments when you use Checkout. You can enable Stripe Tax to automatically compute taxes on all of your Checkout purchases and subscriptions. Make sure to [integrate Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout) before reading through this guide.\n\n#### Note\n\n[\n\n## Update your Products and Prices![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n\n\n](#product-and-price-setup)\n\nWhen calculating tax, Stripe Tax uses information stored on the [Products](https://docs.stripe.com/api/products \"Products\") and [Prices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices \"Prices\") APIs to determine the right rates and rules. You can update your Checkout products and prices to include:\n\n*   `tax_behavior`—Specifies whether the price is considered `inclusive` or `exclusive` of taxes.\n*   `tax_code` (_optional_)—Specifies the product tax code. If you don’t set a `tax_code` on a product, we apply your preset product tax code. For more information, consult our [list of tax codes](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-codes).\n\nWhen you set the `tax_behavior` parameter to `exclusive`, it adds tax to the subtotal. This is common in US markets and for business-to-business (B2B) sales. If you set the `tax_behavior` to `inclusive`, the amount your buyer pays never changes (even if the tax rate varies). This is common practice for business-to-consumer (B2C) buyers in markets outside of the US. If you don’t want to create your products and prices upfront, you can pass the `price_data.tax_behavior` and `product_data.tax_code` parameters in your Checkout session.\n\n#### Note\n\n[](#create-session)\n\nAfter updating your products and prices, you’re ready to start calculating tax on your Checkout sessions. You can create sessions for one-time and recurring purchases.\n\nTo calculate tax for new customers, Checkout validates and uses the provided shipping or billing address. For existing customers, Checkout calculates tax by validating and using the attached customer shipping or billing address. If you capture a new billing or shipping address for an existing customer, Checkout won’t automatically override the previous billing or shipping information. You must explicitly request customer address changes.\n\n### Apple Pay and Google Pay![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nIf you wish to ensure that Google Pay is offered as a payment method while using Stripe Tax in Checkout, you must require collecting a shipping address. Apple Pay with Stripe Tax displays only when the customer’s browser supports Apple Pay version 12.\n\n[](#new-customers)\n\nIf you don’t pass in an existing customer when creating a Checkout session, Checkout creates a new customer and automatically saves the billing address and shipping information. Checkout uses the shipping address entered during the session to determine the customer’s location for calculating tax. If you don’t collect shipping information, Checkout uses the billing address.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/checkout/sessions \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d \"line_items[0][price]\"=  {{PRICE_ID}}   \\  -d \"line_items[0][quantity]\"=2 \\  -d \"automatic_tax[enabled]\"=true \\  -d mode=payment \\   --data-urlencode success_url=\"[https://example.com/success](https://example.com/success)\" \\   --data-urlencode cancel_url=\"[https://example.com/cancel](https://example.com/cancel)\"`",

  "markdown": "# Integrate the customer portal with the API\n\n## Learn how to integrate the customer portal using the Stripe API.\n\n## Get started ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nWith the customer portal, you can provide subscription, billing, and invoicing management to your customers without building it yourself. After you configure and integrate the portal, customers redirect to a co-branded dashboard where they can manage their account based on the functionality you configured.\n\nTo integrate your application with the customer portal:\n\n1.  [Configure](#configure) the portal’s features and user interface (UI). You can do this in the Dashboard.\n2.  [Implement a redirect](#redirect) to integrate the portal with your application.\n3.  [Listen to webhooks](#webhooks) to receive updates to customers’ subscriptions and payment methods.\n4.  [Go live](#go-live) to use the portal in your production environment.\n\nOr clone one of our sample projects:\n\n*   [Firebase](https://github.com/stripe-samples/firebase-subscription-payments)\n*   [Netlify Identity](https://github.com/stripe-samples/netlify-stripe-subscriptions)\n*   [Ruby on Rails](https://github.com/stripe-samples/developer-office-hours/tree/master/2020-06-29-customer-portal).\n\nYou can optionally [customize](#customize) portal sessions to enable different features for different customers.\n\n[](#configure)\n\nFirst, you need a Stripe account. [Register now](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register/).\n\nBefore you integrate the customer portal, configure its functionality and branding in the Dashboard to define what your users can do with the portal. Its features depend on your product and price catalog, so there are different settings for live and test modes.\n\n#### Common mistake\n\nIf you’re using the customer portal with Stripe Connect, make sure you configure the customer portal for the platform, not a connected account.\n\nIf you want to create multiple portal configurations for different sets of customers—or if you’re a [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect \"Connect\") platform and would like to manage configurations for your connected accounts—you can do that by using the [API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customer_portal/configuration):\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/billing_portal/configurations \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d \"business_profile[headline]\"=\"Cactus Practice partners with Stripe for simplified billing.\" \\  -d \"features[invoice_history][enabled]\"=true`\n\n### Set a product catalog ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nIf you allow customers to upgrade, downgrade, or change the quantities of their subscriptions, you must also set a product catalog. This includes the products and prices that your customers can upgrade or downgrade to, as well as the subscriptions they can update quantities on. See the [guide](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/getting-started#create-product) for more details about creating products and prices. If you’re using the customer portal only for invoicing, you don’t need to set a product catalog.\n\nThe portal displays the following attributes of your product catalog:\n\n*   **Product name and description**—these attributes are editable in the Dashboard and API.\n*   **Quantity restrictions per product**—these attributes are editable in the Dashboard.\n*   **Price amount, currency, and billing interval**—these attributes are immutable and you can only set them when you create them in the Dashboard and API.\n\n### Enable tax ID collection ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nIf you use [Stripe Tax](https://docs.stripe.com/tax) to automatically collect taxes for subscriptions or invoices, you can let customers set and update their tax IDs in the customer portal. Stripe Billing adds the tax IDs to the customers’ [invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices \"invoices\"). To enable this, go to the [Customer portal settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/portal) and toggle on **Tax ID**. For more information, see how customer tax IDs work with [subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/customer/tax-ids) and [invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/taxes/account-tax-ids).\n\nLearn how to [set up Stripe Tax](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/set-up), [collect taxes for recurring payments](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/taxes/collect-taxes), [collect taxes in your custom payment flows](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/custom#existing-customer) and [set tax rates for line items and invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/invoicing).\n\n### Preview and test ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nAs you configure your settings, you can preview the portal by clicking **Preview**. This launches a read-only version of the portal that lets you see how your customers could manage their subscriptions and billing details.\n\nAfter saving your settings, you can launch the portal and test it by using a customer in test mode. Navigate to a customer in the Dashboard, click **Actions**, and then select **Open customer portal**.\n\nPreviewing the portal as a read-only version is only available when your Dashboard is in test mode. If you’re unable to preview and test the portal, check your settings to make sure that your configuration is saved in test mode. For previewing and testing to work, you also need to have edit permissions in the Dashboard.\n\n[](#redirect)\n\nA portal session is the entry point into the customer portal. It provides a unique, temporary link to the portal. When a customer wants to manage their billing or invoicing, create a new portal session and redirect them to the session’s `url`.\n\nOn your site, add a button that customers can click to enter the portal. Use a POST request to create a portal session:\n\n`<form method=\"POST\" action=\"/create-customer-portal-session\">   <button type=\"submit\">Manage billing</button> </form>`\n\nNext, add an endpoint that creates a portal session and redirects your customers. Make sure to authenticate customers on your site before creating sessions for them. To [create a session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customer_portal/sessions/create), you need the customer’s ID and a `return_url`, which is required if a default return URL isn’t set in the Dashboard configuration.\n\nWhen you create a portal session, Stripe returns the `portal session object`, which contains the session’s [short-lived URL](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customer_portal/session?lang=curl#portal_session_object-url) that your customers use to access the customer portal.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/billing_portal/sessions \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d customer={{CUSTOMER_ID}} \\   --data-urlencode return_url=\"https://example.com/account\"`\n\n[](#webhooks)\n\nWhen subscriptions are upgraded, downgraded, or canceled, you need to make sure that customers receive only the products or services they’re actively subscribed to. Stripe sends notifications of these changes to your integration using [webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks \"webhook\"). In the `Event` object, look at the ID for the subscription or the customer to determine which customer the event applies to.\n\nStripe also sends notifications if an invoice is paid to your integration using [webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks \"webhook\"). In the `Event` object, look at the ID for the invoice or the customer to determine which customer the event applies to.\n\nIf you haven’t set up a webhook endpoint with Stripe before, you can use Stripe’s [webhooks documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks) to get started, and then listen for the events described below.\n\n| Event | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| [customer.subscription.updated](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-customer.subscription.updated) | Listen to this to monitor subscription upgrades and downgrades.

If you configure the portal to cancel subscriptions at the end of a billing period, listen to the [customer.subscription.updated](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-customer.subscription.updated) event to be notified of cancellations before they occur. If `cancel_at_period_end` is `true`, the subscription is canceled at the end of its billing period.<br><br>If a customer changes their mind, they can reactivate their subscription prior to the end of the billing period. When they do this, a [customer.subscription.updated](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-customer.subscription.updated) event is sent.

  "markdown": "# Automate payment retries | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Automatically retry failed payments and reduce involuntary churn.\n\nAlthough payments can fail for a number of reasons, many of them are recoverable. You can automatically retry failed payments with Stripe, without writing code.\n\nConfigure the settings in the **Retries** tab of the [Revenue recovery](https://dashboard.stripe.com/revenue_recovery/retries) Dashboard.\n\nStripe doesn’t retry payments for:\n\n*   Failures where the issuer provided a non-retryable [decline code](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/revenue-recovery/smart-retries#non-retryable-decline-codes).\n*   Unavailable payment methods\n*   Detached connected accounts (Connect only)\n\nStripe recommends using Smart Retries, but you can also create a custom retry schedule.\n\n## Payment method ordering ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nStripe uses the first payment instrument from this ordered list in retries:\n\n1.  [`subscription.default_payment_method`](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/object#subscription_object-default_payment_method)\n2.  [`subscription.default_source`](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/object#subscription_object-default_source)\n3.  [`customer.invoice_settings.default_payment_method`](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-invoice_settings-default_payment_method)\n4.  [`customer.default_source`](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-default_source)\n\nWhen you update payment methods after a failed payment attempt, update the field where the previous payment failed. For example, if a subscription has a `default_payment_method`, but you only update `customer.invoice_settings.default_payment_method`, Stripe continues to retry on the subscription’s `default_payment_method`.\n\n## Smart Retries ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nUsing machine learning, Smart Retries chooses the best times to retry failed payment attempts to increase the chance of successfully paying an invoice. The machine learning system behind Smart Retries uses time-dependent, dynamic signals, such as:\n\n*   The number of different devices that have presented a given payment method in the last _N_ hours.\n*   The best time to pay (payments made for debit cards in certain countries might be slightly more successful at 12:01 AM in local time zones).\n\nBased on a combination of these factors, Stripe intelligently assesses when to retry payments. We continuously learn from new purchaser behaviors and transactions, which provide for a more targeted approach over traditional rules-based payment retry logic.\n\nSmart Retries reattempts the charge according to your specifications for the number of retries and the maximum duration. You can also use [automations](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/automations) to create different retry policies for different customer segments.\n\nYou can override this behavior by [disabling Smart Retries](https://dashboard.stripe.com/revenue_recovery/retries) and defining your own custom retry rules. When you enable dunning, the [next\\_payment\\_attempt](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/object#invoice_object-next_payment_attempt) attribute indicates when the next collection attempt will be.\n\n## ACH Debit retries ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\n[Enable ACH Debit retries](https://dashboard.stripe.com/revenue_recovery/retries) to have Stripe automatically retry failed ACH Debit payments caused by insufficient funds. Stripe retries the failed ACH Debit a maximum of two times over a 14 day period.\n\nYou can turn on retries for recurring subscription invoices, one-off invoices, or both types of invoice.\n\nBefore retrying, make sure you’ve [obtained authorization](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/ach-debit#mandates) from your customer to retry a debit on their bank account.\n\n## Webhook events ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nFor both Smart Retries and custom retry schedules, Stripe reattempts the charge according to your specified schedule. Use the `invoice.payment_failed` [webhook](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks \"webhook\") to receive subscription payment failure events and retry attempt updates.\n\nThe [attempt\\_count](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/object#invoice_object-next_payment_attempt) attribute on the `invoice.payment_failed` webhook indicates how many attempts have been made so far. If a failure returns a non-retryable return code, we can’t retry invoice payment without a new payment method. Retries continue to be scheduled, and [attempt\\_count](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/object#invoice_object-next_payment_attempt) continues to increment, but retries only execute after detecting a new payment method. Unexecuted retries don’t create a new [Charge](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges).\n\nThe [next\\_payment\\_attempt](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/object#invoice_object-next_payment_attempt) attribute on the invoice indicates the date when Stripe will attempt the next collection. For [automations](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/automations) users, [next\\_payment\\_attempt](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/object#invoice_object-next_payment_attempt) is no longer set in `invoice.payment_failed` webhooks but is set in `invoice.updated` webhooks.\n\n### Non-retryable decline codes ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nIf the card issuer returns the payment with a subset of [decline codes](https://docs.stripe.com/declines/codes) considered as non-retryable, then Stripe can’t automatically retry the payment. These codes are one of `incorrect_number`, `lost_card`, `pickup_card`, `stolen_card`, `revocation_of_authorization`, `revocation_of_all_authorizations` and `highest_risk_level`. For these failures, the scheduled retries continue but the payment executes only if you obtain a new payment method.",

  "markdown": "# How subscriptions work | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\nTo simplify the handling of failed payments and to create subscriptions before attempting payment:\n\n1.  Pass [payment\\_behavior=default\\_incomplete](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/create#create_subscription-payment_behavior) when creating a subscription. If your subscription requires payment, it’s created with an `incomplete` status, otherwise your subscription immediately becomes `active`.\n2.  Activate an incomplete subscription by paying the first invoice.\n3.  Pass the payment intent identifier from the invoice to your user interface to collect payment information and confirm the payment intent. You can use [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/js/elements_object), the [Android SDK](https://stripe.dev/stripe-android/), or the [iOS SDK](https://stripe.dev/stripe-ios/).\n\n### Payment status ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nThe payment process differs across payment methods and geographical locations. Payments can also fail initially (for example, a customer might enter the wrong card number or have insufficient funds), so various payment outcomes are possible.\n\nA [PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents) tracks the lifecycle of every payment. Whenever a payment is due for a subscription, Stripe generates an invoice and a PaymentIntent. The PaymentIntent ID attaches to the invoice and you can access it from the Invoice and Subscription objects. The state of the PaymentIntent affects the state of the invoice and the subscription. Here’s how the different outcomes of a payment map to the different statuses:\n\n| Payment outcome | PaymentIntent status | Invoice status | Subscription status |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Success | `succeeded` | `paid` | `active` |\n| Fails because of a card error | `requires_payment_method` | `open` | `incomplete` |\n| Fails because of authentication | `requires_action` | `open` | `incomplete` |\n\nThe following sections explain these statuses and the actions to take for each.\n\n### Payment succeeded ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nWhen your payment succeeds, the status of the PaymentIntent is `succeeded`, and the subscription becomes `active`. For [payment methods](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/integration-options) with longer processing periods, subscriptions are immediately activated. In these cases, the status of the PaymentIntent may be `processing` for an `active` subscription until the payment succeeds.\n\nWith your subscription now activated, provision access to your product. Read the guide to learn more about [the subscription lifecycle](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/overview#subscription-lifecycle) and best practices for provisioning.\n\n| Response | Subscription | PaymentIntent |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `{   \"id\": \"sub_1ELI8bClCIKljWvsvK36TXlC\",   \"object\": \"subscription\",   \"status\": \"active\",   ...   \"latest_invoice\": {     \"id\": \"in_EmGqfJMYy3Nt9M\",     \"status\": \"paid\",     ...     \"payment_intent\": {       \"status\": \"succeeded\",       ...     }   } }` | **active** | **succeeded** |\n\n![Subscription payment network flow.](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/payment-flow-succeeds.ac7343c9ec9a77e6efa1a84c02bb597d.svg)\n\n### Requires payment method ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nIf payment fails because of a [card error](https://docs.stripe.com/api/errors#errors-card_error), such as a [decline](https://docs.stripe.com/declines#issuer-declines), the status of the PaymentIntent is `requires_payment_method` and the subscription is `incomplete`.\n\n| Response | Subscription | PaymentIntent |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `{   \"id\": \"sub_1ELI8bClCIKljWvsvK36TXlC\",   \"object\": \"subscription\",   \"status\": \"incomplete\",   ...   \"latest_invoice\": {     \"id\": \"in_EmGqfJMYy3Nt9M\",     \"status\": \"open\",     ...     \"payment_intent\": {       \"status\": \"requires_payment_method\",       ...     }   } }` | **incomplete** | **requires\\_payment\\_method** |\n\nTo resolve these scenarios:\n\n*   Notify the customer.\n*   Collect new payment information and [confirm the payment intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/confirm).\n*   Update the [default payment method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/object#subscription_object-default_payment_method) on the subscription.\n\nLearn how to [handle payment failures for subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/webhooks#payment-failures).\n\n![How to handle subscription payment failures.](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/payment-flow-requires-payment-method.8305917aa91650ba7f7e9b6e5999ce32.svg)\n\n### Requires action ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nSome payment methods require customer authentication with [3D Secure](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure) (3DS) to complete the payment process. If you use the [Payment Intents API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents), the value of `latest_invoice.payment_intent.status` is `requires_action` when a customer needs to authenticate a payment. 3DS completes the authentication process. Whether a payment method requires authentication depends on your [Radar rules](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure/authentication-flow#three-ds-radar) and the issuing bank for the card.\n\nRegulations in Europe often require 3D Secure. See [Strong Customer Authentication](https://docs.stripe.com/strong-customer-authentication) to determine whether handling this status is important for your business. If you have an existing billing integration and want to add support for this flow, also see the [Billing SCA Migration guide](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication).\n\n| Response | Subscription | PaymentIntent |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `{   \"id\": \"sub_1ELI8bClCIKljWvsvK36TXlC\",   \"object\": \"subscription\",   \"status\": \"incomplete\",   ...   \"latest_invoice\": {     \"id\": \"in_EmGqfJMYy3Nt9M\",     \"status\": \"open\",     ...     \"payment_intent\": {       \"status\": \"requires_action\",       \"client_secret\": \"pi_91_secret_W9\",       \"next_action\": {         \"type\": \"use_stripe_sdk\",         ...       },       ...     }   } }` | **incomplete** | **requires\\_action** |\n\nTo handle these scenarios:\n\n*   Monitor for the `invoice.payment_action_required` event notification with [webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/webhooks). This indicates that authentication is required.\n*   Notify your customer that they must authenticate.\n*   Retrieve the client secret for the payment intent and pass it in a call to [stripe.ConfirmCardPayment](https://docs.stripe.com/js/payment_intents/confirm_card_payment). This displays an authentication modal to your customers, attempts payment, then closes the modal and returns context to your application.\n*   Monitor the `invoice.paid` event on your webhook endpoint to verify that the payment succeeded. Users can leave your application before `confirmCardPayment()` finishes. Verifying whether the payment succeeded allows you to correctly provision your product.\n\n![How to handle subscription payments that require additional action from the customer.](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/payment-flow-requires-action.ac57889e9bccdb6ec4f5ea47fba194ec.svg)\n\n### Recurring charges ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nStripe handles recurring charges for you automatically. This includes:\n\n*   [Automatically invoicing](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/invoices/subscription#subscription-renewal) customers and attempting payments when new billing cycles start.\n*   When payments fail, Stripe retries them using the [Smart Retries](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/automatic-collection#smart-retries) feature or your custom retry schedule. This automatically re-attempts payment according to your Dashboard settings when cards are declined. If a failure returns a non-retryable [decline code](https://docs.stripe.com/declines/codes), the scheduled retries continue but the payment executes only if you obtain a new payment method.\n\nYou can send a [dunning email](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/send-email \"dunning email\") to customers for overdue payments to increase recovery chances. For payments that require 3D Secure, you can [configure your billing settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/billing/automatic) to send a [hosted link](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/hosted-invoice-page) to customers so they can complete the flow.\n\n#### Build your own handling for recurring charge failures![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nIf you don’t want to use Stripe’s tooling to manage failures, you can build your own. If a payment fails or if it requires customer authentication, the subscription’s `status` is set to `past_due` and the PaymentIntent status is either `requires_payment_method` or `requires_action`.\n\n![Objects involved when handling failed or action required subscription payments.](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/recurring-charge-failure.f0db8a9b3a90000f3df0b98f7aacfa36.svg)\n\nTo manage these scenarios, set up a [webhook](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks \"webhook\") and listen to the [customer.subscription.updated](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-customer.subscription.updated) event so that you’re notified when subscriptions enter a `past_due` state:\n\n`{   \"id\": \"sub_E8uXk63MAbZbto\",   \"object\": \"subscription\",   ...   \"status\": \"past_due\",   \"latest_invoice\": \"in_1EMLu1ClCIKljWvsfTjRFAxa\" }`\n\nFor these subscriptions, you need to get your customers back into your application to collect a different payment method so they can complete the payment. You can use an email or a mobile push notification. Stripe provides built-in reminder emails to handle this case, which you can configure in your [billing settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/billing/automatic).\n\nWhen your customer is back in your application, reuse either your [payment failure flow](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/overview#requires-payment-method) or [customer action flow](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/overview#requires-action) depending on the status of the associated PaymentIntent. After the payment succeeds, the status of the subscription is `active` and the invoice is `paid`.\n\n### Handle non-payment invoices ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nSubscriptions that include [free trials](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/trials), [usage-based billing](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/pricing-models#usage-based-pricing), invoices with coupons, or applied customer credit balances often result in non-payment invoices. This means you don’t immediately charge your customer when you create the subscription.\n\nEven though you don’t charge customers for the first invoice, authenticating and authorizing their card is often beneficial as it can increase the chance that the first non-zero payment completes successfully. Payments made this way are known as off-session payments. To manage these scenarios, Stripe created SetupIntents.\n\n#### Using SetupIntents ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nYou can use SetupIntents to:\n\n*   Collect payment information.\n*   Authenticate your customer’s card to claim [exemptions](https://stripe.com/guides/strong-customer-authentication#exemptions-to-strong-customer-authentication \"SCA exemptions\") later.\n*   Authorize your customer’s card without charging it.\n\nAuthenticating payments allows your customer to grant permissions to charge their card. [Strong Customer Authentication](https://docs.stripe.com/strong-customer-authentication) requires this, and [3DS](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure) is a common way to complete it. Collecting payment method information and authorizing it ensures that you can successfully charge the payment method.\n\nIn off-session scenarios, SetupIntents enable you to charge customers for their first non-zero payment without having to bring them back to your website or app for authentication. This reduces the friction on your customers.\n\nThe `pending_setup_intent` field on a subscription doesn’t cancel automatically when the subscription ends. Listen for `customer.subscription.deleted` webhooks and manually [cancel a subscription SetupIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_intents/cancel) if needed.\n\nStripe automatically creates SetupIntents for subscriptions that don’t require an initial payment. The authentication and authorization process also completes at this point, if required. If both succeed or aren’t required, no action is necessary, and the `subscription.pending_setup_intent` field is `null`. If either step fails, Stripe recommends using the SetupIntent on your frontend to resolve the issue while your customer is on-session. The next two sections explain in detail how to manage scenarios where authentication or authorization fail.\n\n#### Managing authentication failures Client-side ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nAuthentication failures occur when Stripe is unable to authenticate your customer with their card issuer. When this happens, the `status` of the SetupIntent is set to `requires_action`.\n\n![How to handle subscription payment authentication failures.](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/authentication_failure.2eaec43cac8c688f0ff3438fbe3b50e4.svg)\n\nTo resolve these scenarios, call [confirmCardSetup](https://docs.stripe.com/js#stripe-confirm-card-setup) on your frontend so that your customer can complete the authentication flow manually. The code example below [expands](https://docs.stripe.com/api/expanding_objects) the `pending_setup_intent` to complete the flow.\n\n`const {pending_setup_intent} = subscription;  if (pending_setup_intent) {   const {client_secret, status} = subscription.pending_setup_intent;    if (status === \"requires_action\") {     const {setupIntent, error} = await stripe.confirmCardSetup(client_secret);      if (error) {       // Display error.message in your UI.     } else {       // The setup has succeeded. Display a success message.     }   } }`\n\nAfter completing this flow, authorization executes if it’s required. If authorization succeeds, or if it’s not required, `pending_setup_intent` is updated to `null` upon completion.\n\nPayment authorization failures occur when Stripe can’t verify that a card can be charged. When this happens, the `status` of the SetupIntent is set to `requires_payment_method`. This generally means that subsequent charges with that card fail.\n\n![How to handle subscription payment authorization failures.](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/authorization_failure.0b6ca4a2e2bbeba11710bf22fb0a5d00.svg)\n\nTo resolve these scenarios, [collect a new payment method](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/overview#requires-payment-method), then update the default payment method for your customer or the subscription. The code example below [expands](https://docs.stripe.com/api/expanding_objects) the `pending_setup_intent` to complete the flow.\n\n`const {pending_setup_intent, latest_invoice} = subscription;  if (pending_setup_intent) {   const {client_secret, status} = subscription.pending_setup_intent;    if (status === \"requires_action\") {     const {setupIntent, error} = await stripe.confirmCardSetup(client_secret);      if (error) {       // Display error.message in your UI.     } else {       // The setup has succeeded. Display a success message.     }   } else if (status === \"requires_payment_method\") {     // Collect new payment method   } }`",

  "markdown": "# Automation recipes | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## View example recipes for common automations.\n\nIn this guide, we provide popular automation recipes to give you an idea of how to use automations in different scenarios. To get an overview of the different triggers, filter conditions, and actions available, see [Automations](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/automations).\n\n[](#custom-dunning-flow)\n\nIncrease your recovery rate by customizing dunning behavior based on billing interval, invoice amount, or customer segment. For example, you might want to grant longer grace periods to annual or high-value customers, or retry more frequently for a specific customer segment.\n\nTo customize automations:\n\n1.  Click **New automation**.\n2.  Give the automation a descriptive name, such as “Annual subscriber dunning.”\n3.  Select the **Subscription payment fails** as the trigger.\n4.  (Optional) Choose the conditions that must be met for the automation to run. In this case, Subscription interval is: **yearly**.\n5.  Add the **Start retry policy** action, and select **\\+ Create new retry policy** in the dropdown. Choose **Smart Retries for subscriptions** and retry up to **8 times** within **2 months**.\n6.  (Optional) Add a delay of 7 days as an additional grace period for manual outreach.\n7.  Add the **Cancel subscription** action.\n8.  Add the **Mark invoice uncollectible** action (which makes it a write-off for [Revenue Recognition](https://docs.stripe.com/revenue-recognition/methodology/subscriptions-and-invoicing#uncollectible-invoices)).\n\n[](#invoice-overdue-notifications)\n\nTo improve cash flow and customer communications, keep track of high-value unpaid invoices. This recipe automates notifications for high-value invoices, enabling your team to take proactive measures to encourage the customer to pay the outstanding invoice.\n\nTo implement these notifications:\n\n1.  Click **New automation**.\n2.  Give the automation a descriptive name, such as “Notify Collections team of high-value late invoices.”\n3.  Select the **Invoice is overdue** as the trigger.\n4.  Add a filter condition to select invoices **greater than** **$500**.\n5.  Add a **Send email** action and select a recipient using the company email domain.\n6.  Write a short memo such as “Invoice over $500 is overdue by X days” in the memo field.\n\nModify this recipe to meet your specific business needs, such as adjusting the overdue dollar amount and length of overdue period. The recipient must use the company email domain or be a user on the Stripe account.\n\n[](#subscription-cancellation-confirmation)\n\nTo enhance customer communication, automatically send subscribers a confirmation email when their subscription is canceled.\n\nSending the confirmation email doesn’t prevent churn, but it can help to maintain a positive customer relationship and provide an opportunity to gather the cancellation reason, which allows you to further improve your service.\n\nTo set up this recipe with automations:\n\n1.  Click **New automation**.\n2.  Give the automation a descriptive name, such as “Subscription cancellation confirmation.”\n3.  Select the **Subscription is canceled** as the trigger.\n4.  (Optional) Add a filter condition to restrict the automation by customer segment, subscription product or plan, or subscription amount.\n5.  Select the **Send email to customer** action.\n6.  Stripe provides a predefined email template for the confirmation email. The email includes the subscription details and confirms the cancellation date. You also have the option to include a link to a cancellation reason survey.\n\n[](#signup-spend-credit)\n\nBusinesses with usage based pricing models can give new users a spend credit to get started. This can lower the barrier to entry for new users trying your products by helping reduce friction to sign up and increase activation rates.\n\nTo set this recipe with automations:\n\n1.  Click **New automation**.\n2.  Give the automation a descriptive name, such as “New customer spend credit.”\n3.  Select **Customer is created** as the trigger.\n4.  (Optional) Select the **Create a subscription** action.\n5.  Select the **Credit customer balance** action.\n6.  At the prompt, enter the amount of the credit.\n\nModify this recipe to meet your specific needs, such as adjusting the dollar amount of the credit adjustment and whether you want to create a subscription for this new customer.",

  "markdown": "# Automate customer emails | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Learn how you can use customer emails to recover revenue.\n\nCustomer emails help prevent involuntary churn by notifying customers and giving them a chance to intervene when churn is likely, like when a payment fails.\n\nEnable email notifications for all the use cases that make sense for your business. We recommend you minimally provide a way for customers to:\n\n*   [Confirm payments](#payment-confirmation-notifications)\n*   [Correct failed payments](#failed-payment-notifications)\n\n## Configure emails![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYou can turn on customer emails in your [subscriptions and emails settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/automatic) Dashboard without writing any code. All of these emails and hosted pages use your [branding settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/branding).\n\nEmails for the following notification types include a link to a page where the customer can update their payment method.\n\n*   Payment confirmation notifications\n*   Failed payment notifications\n*   Trial ending reminders\n*   Renewal reminders\n*   Expiring card notifications\n\nYou can set the link destination to your own custom link or [a Stripe-hosted page](#link-to-a-stripe-hosted-page). If you **Use your own custom link** and don’t provide a URL, we use your business website.\n\n## Failed payment notifications![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nNotify your customers about failed payments for subscriptions to encourage them to resolve the reason for failure, such as an expired card. Enable **Send emails when card payments fail** in the [revenue recovery settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/revenue_recovery/emails) page.\n\nWhen you enable this setting, Stripe automatically sends an email to your customer after each failed payment. The email lets your customer know that their recent subscription payment failed and gives them the opportunity to update their payment method so it can be retried successfully.\n\n### Customize the email message Beta![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nFor failed payment emails, you can write your own email message to your customers instead of using the default email message. You’ll also need to use a verified [custom domain](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/email-domain) to send emails from.\n\n1.  Click the **customize** link in the sentence below the **Send emails to customers to update failed card payment methods** option.\n    \n2.  Choose the **Use your own custom email** option.\n    \n3.  Read the email policy guidelines. By law, you can’t add promotional content without explicit consent from the customer.\n    \n4.  Fill out the contents of the email. As you enter information, you can see a preview of the email.\n    \n\n## Unpaid recurring invoice reminders![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nTo send reminder emails about unpaid invoices, enable **Send reminders if a recurring invoice hasn’t been paid** in the [billing settings page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/automatic), in the **Manage invoices sent to customers** section.\n\nThis sends payment reminders for recurring invoices with a collection method of [send\\_invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/object#invoice_object-collection_method) on the configured schedule.\n\n## Trial ending reminders![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nUnder [Manage free trial messaging](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/automatic), turn on **Send a reminder email 7 days before a free trial ends** to send a trial ending reminder.\n\nWhen the trial ends without a payment method and the subscription is paused, customers can activate the subscription on the hosted page. They can add a payment method to activate the subscription and pay the first invoice.\n\n## Renewal reminders![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nUnder [Prevent failed payments](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/automatic), turn on **Send emails about upcoming renewals**.\n\nStripe sends this email before the current renewal period ends based on the days configured in the **Upcoming renewal events** section.\n\nThe renewal date in the email uses the customer’s timezone. If the customer’s timezone isn’t defined, it uses the timezone set in your [account settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/account). Otherwise, it defaults to UTC.\n\n## Payment confirmation notifications![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nSome payments might require manual customer intervention, like those that use [3D Secure](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure) or the [Boleto](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/boleto/accept-a-payment) payment method. You can [manage payments that require confirmation](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/automatic) in the Dashboard.\n\n1.  To automatically send an email to your customer when their payment requires confirmation, enable **Send a Stripe-hosted link for customers to confirm their payments when required**. The email includes a link to a Stripe-hosted page where your customer can confirm the payment.\n2.  To continue sending emails until your customer confirms the payment or it expires, enable **Send reminders if payment confirmation isn’t completed**. You can customize the intervals at which Stripe sends these reminders. Each reminder includes a link similar to the original email where the customer can confirm the payment.\n\n## Expiring card notifications![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nUnder [Prevent failed payments](https://dashboard.stripe.com/revenue_recovery/emails), turn on **Send emails about expiring cards**.\n\nThis automatically sends an email 1 month before your customer’s card on file expires.\n\n## Link to a Stripe-hosted page ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nWith the **Link to a Stripe-hosted page** option, Stripe provides a secure, private URL to a Stripe-hosted page in the email. Stripe doesn’t include a link to the Stripe-hosted page if the subscription is set to manually send an invoice.\n\nOn that page, your customer can update their payment method for the relevant subscription and pay any outstanding invoices if applicable.\n\nHow a customer updates their payment method on the Stripe-hosted page.\n\nAny of the following conditions invalidate the link to the hosted payment page:\n\n*   It’s been 30 days since we sent the trial ending email.\n*   The [subscription status](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/overview#subscription-statuses) changes to `cancelled`, `incomplete_expired`, or `unpaid`.\n*   The trial ended and the customer already provided a payment method for the subscription.\n*   The subscription’s current renewal period expired.\n\n## Test your configuration![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nIn [test mode](https://docs.stripe.com/test-mode \"test mode\"), Stripe doesn’t automatically send customer emails. To test your customer email settings, use email addresses that belong to your verified [email domain](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/emails) or an active [team member](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/team). If a test mode customer’s email matches either of those conditions, Stripe sends failed payment notifications, upcoming invoice reminders, trial ending reminders, and card expiring reminders in test mode.\n\n## Email logs![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYou can find logs for emails sent within the last 30 days on the [customer](https://dashboard.stripe.com/customers) page. The logs are updated daily, so they don’t include emails from the current date.\n\nWe log the following types of email notifications:\n\n*   Failed payment attempts.\n*   Finalized invoices.\n*   Receipts for paid invoices.\n*   Payments requiring 3D Secure.\n*   Expiring cards on file.\n*   Unpaid one-off invoices. Invoicing Plus\n*   Created credit notes.\n*   Issued refunds.\n*   Ending subscription trials.\n*   Canceled subscriptions.",

  "markdown": "# Zero tax amounts and reverse charges\n\n## Learn about cases when Stripe Tax calculates zero tax.\n\n#### Note\n\nStripe Tax returns a tax calculation result on every request. However, Tax isn’t collected on a transaction in some situations, and the resulting tax amount is zero. For example, if you’re expanding `tax_amounts` on an [invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices \"invoices\"), you might see something like:\n\n`{   \"id\": \"in_1HF0KNFsnTpWVWVzFDgSizOj\",   \"object\": \"invoice\",   ...   \"total_details\": {     \"amount_tax\": 0,     \"breakdown\": {       \"taxes\": [         {           \"amount\": 0,           \"taxability_reason\": \"not_collecting\",           \"rate\": {             \"id\": \"txr_1HHwa4Jm3J7Jh9FBnYJ9glJZ\",             \"object\": \"tax_rate\",             \"description\": \"VAT Germany\",             \"display_name\": \"VAT\",             \"country\": \"DE\",             \"created\": 1597863856,             \"inclusive\": false,             \"jurisdiction\": \"DE\",             \"livemode\": false,             \"metadata\": {},             \"percentage\": 0.0,             \"state\": null,             \"tax_type\": \"vat\",             \"active\": false,           }         }       ]     },   },   ... }`\n\nThe API returns the reason for a tax result in the [taxability\\_reason](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/line_item#invoice_line_item_object-tax_amounts-taxability_reason) field.\n\nThe most common reasons for a zero tax result are the following:\n\n| Reason | taxability\\_reason | Explanation |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Not registered | `not_collecting` | You must register before collecting tax in a jurisdiction. You can specify where you’re registered to collect tax on [the Tax settings page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/tax). |\n| Exempt or zero-rated products | `product_exempt` | Certain products are exempt from tax or zero-rated. In both cases the buyer doesn’t pay tax. |\n| Reverse charge | `reverse_charge` | Transactions between two businesses might be subject to reverse charge. In these cases, the buyer is responsible for accounting for the VAT due under the reverse charge. |\n| Exempt customers | `customer_exempt` | Some customers are exempt from paying indirect tax in certain jurisdictions. You can specify when a customer is exempt on the Customer object. |\n| Excluded territory | `not_supported` | Some countries have administrative subdivisions or territories, with the geographic region being outside the scope of the associated country’s VAT system. A list of these excluded territories is below. |\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/taxability.cfcdfce0aab058702149b65a5804547a.png)\n\nThe tax outcome for each payment is available when viewing a payment in [the Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/) under Taxability.\n\n## Situations where Stripe calculates zero tax![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nStripe Tax calculates zero tax in the following situations:\n\n### Not registered![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nTaxing authorities require businesses to obtain a license or otherwise register before starting to collect tax in their jurisdiction. Each jurisdiction has their own rules regarding when you’re obligated to register and begin collecting and remitting tax. Obligations can arise from, but are not limited to, a physical presence in the jurisdiction or from reaching a threshold of sales into a jurisdiction. For example, as of February 2021, for businesses based outside of California (for example, no physical presence), you only need to register when you surpass 500,000 USD in sales.\n\nStripe automatically aggregates and analyzes your transactions and compares them to local thresholds. You can see these and add your registrations on the [Thresholds tab](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/thresholds).\n\nLearn more about how to [register for sales tax, VAT, and GST](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries) in each location and, if you’re a Connect platform, how to [use the Registrations API to manage tax registrations](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/registrations-api).\n\n### Exempt or zero rated products![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nProducts might be exempt or nontaxable in some jurisdictions. For example, as of February 2021, the state of California considers software as a service to be a nontaxable service. The buyer pays no tax and the seller usually can’t reclaim any credits from costs associated with producing the product.\n\nProducts can also be zero-rated, meaning while they’re technically taxable, the applied rate is 0%. For example, as of February 2021, children’s clothing is zero-rated in Ireland. The buyer pays no tax, however the seller might be able to reclaim credits from costs associated with producing the product.\n\nThe tax treatment of products not only varies by jurisdiction but is subject to change. If you don’t want to collect tax on a given product, you can assign the product tax code Nontaxable (`txcd_00000000`) to it, to make sure Stripe Tax treats it as a nontaxable product. Otherwise, Stripe Tax automatically determines when a product is exempt or zero rated.\n\n### Reverse charges ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nWhile in most transactions, the seller is responsible for collecting and remitting tax owed by the buyer, in a reverse charge transaction the buyer must calculate and remit the tax. In that case, the seller’s invoice specifies that the transaction is a reverse charge and doesn’t include tax in the total amount. A reverse charge is common in cross-border B2B supply of services. For example, for businesses with an origin address in the EU, the following logic applies:\n\n| Buyers from | B2C | B2B |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Same EU country | Charge VAT | Charge VAT |\n| Different EU country | Charge VAT | No VAT (reverse charge) |\n\nStripe Tax automatically applies the right logic depending on the presence of a tax ID and the jurisdictions involved in the transaction.\n\nFor transactions with `inclusive` tax behavior where reverse charge applies, the buyer pays the full `unit_amount` Price, but isn’t charged tax. In these cases, a “Reverse Charge” indicator appears in the Stripe Dashboard, and the Invoice reads “Tax to be paid on reverse charge basis” instead of zero.\n\nIf you haven’t collected the customer’s tax ID in Stripe, but you want to handle their transactions as reverse charges, set their `customer.tax_exempt` attribute to `reverse`. If Checkout creates a one-time payment, the exemption status is instead captured as `customer_details` in the Checkout Session object. You’re responsible for making sure that customer information is accurate (including a tax identification number).\n\nThe following examples show invoices generated with and without a known customer tax ID:\n\n*   [Customer’s tax ID automates reverse charge (PDF)](https://stripe.com/files/docs/billing/taxes/example-reverse-charge.pdf)\n*   [Explicitly set reverse charge (PDF)](https://stripe.com/files/docs/billing/taxes/example-reverse-charge-customer.pdf)\n\nStripe displays the provided customer tax ID on an invoice, regardless of whether it’s valid. Stripe Tax automatically validates the tax ID format against the expected format and the tax ID value against external tax authority systems for certain countries.\n\n[Learn more about Tax IDs](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/customer/tax-ids)\n\n[](#exempt-customers)\n\nExempt customers are those who under a jurisdiction’s rules can make tax-exempt purchases. Each taxing jurisdiction determines the type of individuals or entities who can make tax-exempt purchases. Common examples are nonprofit organizations and government entities.\n\nIf you have customers that are exempt from paying tax, set their tax status to `exempt` and provide the customer ID when creating a subscription, invoice, or Checkout Session. To set a customer’s exempt status, use the API to set the `customer.tax_exempt` field to `exempt` or use the Dashboard:\n\n1.  On the [Customers page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/customers), select the customer.\n2.  Open the overflow menu () and select **Edit information**.\n3.  Scroll to the **Tax status** section and select **Exempt** from the dropdown.\n\nFor transactions with `inclusive` tax behavior where the customer is exempt, the buyer pays the full `unit_amount` Price, but there’s no tax charged. In these cases, an “Exempt” indicator appears in the Stripe Dashboard and the Invoice reads “Customer is tax exempt” instead of zero.\n\n[Download example exempt invoice PDF](https://stripe.com/files/docs/billing/taxes/example-exempt.pdf)\n\nStripe Tax automatically calculates an exemption on the transaction when you set the `customer.tax_exempt` field, but it doesn’t perform any validation of required documentation for supporting an exemption such as customer exemption certificates.

If your customer is in a location supported by tax ID collection, Checkout shows a checkbox allowing the customer to indicate that they’re purchasing as a business. When a customer checks the box, Checkout displays fields for them to enter the tax ID and legal entity name for the business. If available, Checkout uses the customer’s shipping address to determine their location, otherwise Checkout uses the customer’s billing address. Customers can only enter one tax ID.\n\n### New Customers![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nTo enable tax ID collection for new customers, set [`tax_id_collection[enabled]`](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-tax_id_collection-enabled) to `true` when creating a Checkout session.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/checkout/sessions \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d \"line_items[0][price_data][unit_amount]\"=1000 \\  -d \"line_items[0][price_data][product_data][name]\"=T-shirt \\  -d \"line_items[0][price_data][currency]\"=eur \\  -d \"line_items[0][quantity]\"=2 \\  -d \"tax_id_collection[enabled]\"=true \\  -d mode=payment \\   --data-urlencode success_url=\"[https://example.com/success](https://example.com/success)\" \\   --data-urlencode cancel_url=\"[https://example.com/cancel](https://example.com/cancel)\"`\n\n#### Note\n\nThe above code example creates a Session in `payment` mode with tax ID collection enabled. For subscriptions, make the same changes with the [mode](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-mode) set to `subscription`.\n\nYou can additionally configure Checkout to create a new [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object) for you using [customer\\_creation](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-customer_creation). If you do, Checkout saves any tax ID information collected during a Session to that new [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers \"Customers\"). If not, the tax ID information will still be available at [customer\\_details.tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/object#checkout_session_object-customer_details-tax_ids).\n\n### Existing Customers![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nIf you pass an existing Customer when creating a Session, Checkout updates the Customer with any tax ID information collected during the Session. Checkout saves the collected business name onto the Customer’s [name](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-name) property, and adds the collected tax ID to the Customer’s [customer.tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-tax_ids) array. Since the collection of a business name could result in the Customer’s existing [name](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-name) being overridden, you must set [customer\\_update.name](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-customer_update-name) to `auto` when creating the Session.\n\n#### Caution\n\nCheckout only collects tax IDs on Customer’s that don’t already have an existing tax ID. If a Customer has one or more tax IDs saved, Checkout doesn’t display the tax ID collection form even if tax ID collection is enabled.\n\nWhen collecting tax IDs for existing customers you can either base their location on existing addresses on the customer or the addresses entered during checkout. By default, Checkout looks for existing addresses on the customer to assess their location:\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/checkout/sessions \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d customer=  {{CUSTOMER_ID}}   \\  -d \"line_items[0][price_data][unit_amount]\"=1000 \\  -d \"line_items[0][price_data][product_data][name]\"=T-shirt \\  -d \"line_items[0][price_data][currency]\"=eur \\  -d \"line_items[0][quantity]\"=2 \\  -d \"tax_id_collection[enabled]\"=true \\  -d \"customer_update[name]\"=auto \\  -d mode=payment \\   --data-urlencode success_url=\"[https://example.com/success](https://example.com/success)\" \\   --data-urlencode cancel_url=\"[https://example.com/cancel](https://example.com/cancel)\"`\n\nIf you don’t have the addresses of your existing customers saved, you can base their location on the billing or shipping address entered during Checkout. To specify that you want to use the billing address entered during Checkout to assess the customer’s location, you must set [customer\\_update.address](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-customer_update-address) to `auto`.\n\n#### Note\n\nWhen setting [customer\\_update.address](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-customer_update-address) to `auto`, Checkout replaces any previously saved addresses on the customer with the address entered during the session.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/checkout/sessions \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d customer=  {{CUSTOMER_ID}}   \\  -d \"line_items[0][price_data][unit_amount]\"=1000 \\  -d \"line_items[0][price_data][product_data][name]\"=T-shirt \\  -d \"line_items[0][price_data][currency]\"=eur \\  -d \"line_items[0][quantity]\"=2 \\  -d \"tax_id_collection[enabled]\"=true \\  -d \"customer_update[name]\"=auto \\  -d \"customer_update[address]\"=auto \\  -d mode=payment \\   --data-urlencode success_url=\"[https://example.com/success](https://example.com/success)\" \\   --data-urlencode cancel_url=\"[https://example.com/cancel](https://example.com/cancel)\"`\n\nIf you’re collecting shipping addresses for existing customers, you must base their location on the shipping address entered during checkout. To do so, set [customer\\_update.shipping](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-customer_update-shipping) to `auto`.\n\n#### Note\n\nWhen setting [customer\\_update.shipping](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-customer_update-shipping) to `auto`, Checkout replaces any previously saved shipping addresses on the customer with the shipping address entered during the session.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/checkout/sessions \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d customer=cus_HQmikpKnGHkNwW \\  -d \"line_items[0][price_data][unit_amount]\"=1000 \\  -d \"line_items[0][price_data][product_data][name]\"=T-shirt \\  -d \"line_items[0][price_data][currency]\"=eur \\  -d \"line_items[0][quantity]\"=2 \\  -d \"tax_id_collection[enabled]\"=true \\  -d \"customer_update[name]\"=auto \\  -d \"customer_update[shipping]\"=auto \\  -d \"shipping_address_collection[allowed_countries][0]\"=DE \\  -d mode=payment \\   --data-urlencode success_url=\"[https://example.com/success](https://example.com/success)\" \\   --data-urlencode cancel_url=\"[https://example.com/cancel](https://example.com/cancel)\"`\n\n#### Note\n\nThe above code example creates a Session in `payment` mode with tax ID collection enabled. For subscriptions, make the same changes with the [mode](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-mode) set to `subscription`.\n\n[](#retrieving-details)\n\nCheckout includes provided tax IDs on the resulting [Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/object) object. After each completed Session, Checkout emits a [checkout.session.completed](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-checkout.session.completed) event that you can listen for in a [webhook](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks \"webhook\") endpoint. If you want to retrieve the collected tax ID from the Session object, it’s available under the Session’s [customer\\_details.tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/object#checkout_session_object-customer_details-tax_ids) array:\n\n`{   \"object\": {     \"id\": \"cs_test_a1dJwt0TCJTBsDkbK7RcoyJ91vJxe2Y\",     \"object\": \"checkout.session\",     ...     \"customer\": \"cus_id_of_new_customer\",     \"customer_details\": {       ...       \"tax_ids\": [         {`\n\nCheckout also saves collected tax IDs and business names to the [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object) object if one is associated with the Session. A tax ID collected during checkout is accessible under the Customer’s [customer.tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-tax_ids) array. You can also retrieve all tax IDs saved to a Customer with the [Tax IDs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/list) resource by specifying the [owner.type](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/list#list_tax_ids-owner-type) parameter to `customer` and [owner.customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/list#list_tax_ids-owner-customer) to the Customer’s ID. Every new tax ID includes an associated legal business name, which Checkout saves to the Customer’s [name](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-name) property. In doing so, the collected legal business name is always visible on any subscription invoices for that Customer.\n\n[](#testing)\n\nIn test mode you can enter any alphanumeric string that is in the correct format of a supported tax ID type (for example, `DE123456789` for `eu_vat`). For a full list of example tax IDs you can reference our [Customer Tax ID guide](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/customer/tax-ids#supported-tax-id). You can also use our [test tax IDs](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/testing#test-business-tax-ids) to test various verification state flows.\n\n[](#validation)\n\nCheckout performs checks during the Session to make sure that provided tax IDs are formatted correctly. We don’t verify that provided tax IDs are valid during the Session. You’re responsible for ensuring the validity of customer information collected during Checkout. To help, Stripe automatically performs asynchronous validation against government databases for [Australian Business (ABN)](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/customer/tax-ids#abn) numbers, [European Value-Added-Tax (EU VAT)](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/customer/tax-ids#eu-vat) numbers, and [United Kingdom Value-Added-Tax (GB VAT)](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/customer/tax-ids#gb-vat) numbers. You can read more on the validation we perform, and how to consume the status of those checks in our [Customer Tax ID guide](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/customer/tax-ids#validation).",

  "markdown": "# Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Taxes\n\n## Learn about Stripe Tax and how to use it with invoices.\n\nOn an [invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices \"invoices\"), Stripe Tax calculates sales tax, VAT, and GST. To calculate these for each line item, Stripe uses:\n\n*   Your [tax settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/tax)\n*   The customer’s tax settings and location\n*   The product tax code and price tax behavior\n\n#### Note\n\n## Set up the customer ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nWe use the customer’s location to determine the relevant taxes to collect. Customers outside of the US need at least a country-level address, while customers in the US require a 5-digit postal code. For Canada, we need at least the province or postal code.\n\nYou can add customer location information in the **Customer details** page by clicking **Edit** next to **Details**. To add a customer’s location from the [Invoice Editor](https://dashboard.stripe.com/invoices/create), click the overflow menu () next to the customer. Select **Edit customer information**, click **Add additional details**, and scroll down to **Billing details**.\n\nAfter you update the location, click **Update customer**. Stripe applies the new location to all of your customer’s future invoices unless you update it. For more information, see [Determine customer locations](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/customer-locations).\n\n## Set up line items![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nTo calculate tax on each line item on an invoice, you need to set a tax behavior and optionally a tax code.\n\n### Customize tax settings for one-off line items![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nCustomize line items in the Invoice Editor by selecting the tax behavior from the **Include tax in price** drop-down menu.\n\n![Customize tax settings for one-off line items](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/invoicing_price.faa90fb6b3cb833b900e06cb2187d339.png)\n\nCustomize tax settings for one-off line items\n\n### Customize tax settings for product-based line items ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nYou can use both the Dashboard and the API to customize tax settings for product-based line items.\n\nOn the [Products page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/products), you can select both the tax behavior for a particular price and the optional tax code for the product. The tax behavior is per price. You can’t change the tax behavior after you select it, but you can create new prices or archive old ones. To set up a tax behavior, click **Add a price** (or **Add another price** if you already have one) and select it from the **Tax behavior** drop-down menu.\n\nTo set up a tax code, select it from the **Tax code** drop-down menu when you create a new product or edit the details of an existing one.\n\n![Customize tax settings for one-off line items](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/invoicing_new_price.517f186f27925e52e501019b9aecc94b.png)\n\nCustomize tax settings for one-off line items\n\n## Enable automatic tax ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nAfter specifying a tax behavior and tax code, you can add the price to the customer as an invoice item:\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/invoiceitems \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d customer=cus_13729he8947269 \\  -d price=price_1K6mzG2eZvKYlo2CK7kcBICl`\n\nSet the toggle in the **Invoice Editor**. In the API, you need to pass the `automatic_tax` field to enable or disable automatic tax calculation. Both steps are required to start calculating tax automatically.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/invoices \\   -u` \n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`: \\   -d \"customer\"=\"cus_13729he8947269\" \\   -d \"automatic_tax[enabled]\"=\"true\"`\n\nTo enable automatic tax calculation when you update an invoice, add the `invoice` parameter alongside `automatic_tax`:\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/invoices \\   -u` \n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`: \\   -d \"invoice\"=\"inv_12345\" \\   -d \"automatic_tax[enabled]\"=\"true\"`\n\nFor more information on automatic tax calculation, see [Automatically collect tax on invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/invoicing).\n\n## Net prices and taxes ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nYou can issue invoices with line item prices that exclude inclusive tax. Tax-exclusive prices are only shown in the invoice PDF. That means, when using inclusive tax, the Hosted Invoice Page and invoice emails show tax-inclusive prices. You can define the settings for net prices in the Dashboard or API.\n\n*   **Include inclusive tax**—The invoice PDF displays line item prices including the inclusive tax. (This is the default.)\n*   **Exclude tax**—The invoice PDF displays line item prices excluding tax.\n\n#### Order precedence\n\nIf you set a default for line item prices at the customer level, it takes precedence over account-level settings.\n\nTo set a default for item prices, go to **Default item prices** in the [Invoice template](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/invoice). Your chosen setting applies to all of the invoices you create through the Dashboard or API. For one-off invoices, use the [Invoice Editor](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/invoices/create) to set tax exclusivity. Go to **Advanced options** and choose to **Include inclusive tax** or **Exclude tax**. To learn more, see [Create an invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/dashboard#create-invoice).\n\n## See also![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n*   [Determine customer locations](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/customer-locations)\n*   [Understand zero tax amounts](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/zero-tax)\n*   [Reporting and filing](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/reports)",
