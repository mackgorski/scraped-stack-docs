    "markdown": "# Retrieve a cash balance | Stripe API Reference\n\nRetrieves a customer’s cash balance.\n\n### Parameters\n\nNo parameters.\n\n### Returns\n\nThe Cash Balance object for a given customer.\n\nGET /v1/customers/:id/cash\\_balance\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/customers/cus_OaCLf8Fi1nbFpJ/cash_balance \\  -u \"sk_test_4eC39Hq...arjtT1zdp7dcsk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc:\"\n```\n\n```\n{  \"object\": \"cash_balance\",  \"available\": {    \"eur\": 10000  },  \"customer\": \"cus_OaCLf8Fi1nbFpJ\",  \"livemode\": false,  \"settings\": {    \"reconciliation_mode\": \"automatic\",    \"using_merchant_default\": true  }}\n```\n\n## [Customer Portal Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customer_portal/sessions)\n\nThe Billing customer portal is a Stripe-hosted UI for subscription and billing management.\n\nA portal configuration describes the functionality and features that you want to provide to your customers through the portal.\n\nA portal session describes the instantiation of the customer portal for a particular customer. By visiting the session’s URL, the customer can manage their subscriptions and billing details. For security reasons, sessions are short-lived and will expire if the customer does not visit the URL. Create sessions on-demand when customers intend to manage their subscriptions and billing details.\n\nRelated guide: [Customer management](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management)\n\n## [Invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices)\n\nInvoices are statements of amounts owed by a customer, and are either generated one-off, or generated periodically from a subscription.\n\nThey contain [invoice items](#invoiceitems), and proration adjustments that may be caused by subscription upgrades/downgrades (if necessary).\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed through automatic charges, Stripe automatically finalizes your invoice and attempts payment. Note that finalizing the invoice, [when automatic](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/automatic-advancement-collection), does not happen immediately as the invoice is created. Stripe waits until one hour after the last webhook was successfully sent (or the last webhook timed out after failing). If you (and the platforms you may have connected to) have no webhooks configured, Stripe waits one hour after creation to finalize the invoice.\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed by sending an email, then based on your [email settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/billing/automatic), Stripe will email the invoice to your customer and await payment. These emails can contain a link to a hosted page to pay the invoice.\n\nStripe applies any customer credit on the account before determining the amount due for the invoice (i.e., the amount that will be actually charged). If the amount due for the invoice is less than Stripe’s [minimum allowed charge per currency](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts), the invoice is automatically marked paid, and we add the amount due to the customer’s credit balance which is applied to the next invoice.\n\nMore details on the customer’s credit balance are [here](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/customer/balance).\n\nRelated guide: [Send invoices to customers](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/invoices/sending)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create)[POST/v1/invoices/create\\_preview](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create_preview)[POST/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/lines/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_line)[GET/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/retrieve)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming)[GET/v1/invoices/:id/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming_invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/list)[DELETE/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/delete)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/add\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/add_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/remove\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/remove_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/update\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/finalize](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/finalize)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/mark\\_uncollectible](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/mark_uncollectible)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/pay](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/pay)[GET/v1/invoices/search](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/search)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/send](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/send)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/void](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/void)\n\n## [Meter Events](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event)\n\nA billing meter event represents a customer’s usage of a product. Meter events are used to bill a customer based on their usage. Meter events are associated with billing meters, which define the shape of the event’s payload and how those events are aggregated for billing.\n\n## [Meter Event Adjustment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_adjustment)\n\nA billing meter event adjustment is a resource that allows you to cancel a meter event. For example, you might create a billing meter event adjustment to cancel a meter event that was created in error or attached to the wrong customer.\n\n## [Meter Event Summary](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_summary)\n\nA billing meter event summary represents an aggregated view of a customer’s billing meter events within a specified timeframe. It indicates how much usage was accrued by a customer for that period.\n\n## [Plans](https://docs.stripe.com/api/plans)\n\nYou can now model subscriptions more flexibly using the [Prices API](#prices). It replaces the Plans API and is backwards compatible to simplify your migration.\n\nPlans define the base price, currency, and billing cycle for recurring purchases of products. [Products](#products) help you track inventory or provisioning, and plans help you track pricing. Different physical goods or levels of service should be represented by products, and pricing options should be represented by plans. This approach lets you change prices without having to change your provisioning scheme.\n\nFor example, you might have a single “gold” product that has plans for $10/month, $100/year, €9/month, and €90/year.\n\nRelated guides: [Set up a subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/set-up-subscription) and more about [products and prices](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/overview).\n\n## [Tax IDs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_create)[POST/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/create)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_retrieve)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/retrieve)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_list)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/list)[DELETE/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_delete)[DELETE/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/delete)\n\n## [Account Links](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_links)\n\nAccount Links are the means by which a Connect platform grants a connected account permission to access Stripe-hosted applications, such as Connect Onboarding.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect Onboarding](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom/hosted-onboarding)\n\n## [Account Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_sessions)\n\nAn AccountSession allows a Connect platform to grant access to a connected account in Connect embedded components.\n\nWe recommend that you create an AccountSession each time you need to display an embedded component to your user. Do not save AccountSessions to your database as they expire relatively quickly, and cannot be used more than once.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect embedded components](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-connect-embedded-components)\n\n## [Application Fees](https://docs.stripe.com/api/application_fees)\n\nWhen you collect a transaction fee on top of a charge made for your user (using [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)), an `Application Fee` object is created in your account. You can list, retrieve, and refund application fees.\n\nRelated guide: [Collecting application fees](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges#collect-fees)\n\n## [Country Specs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/country_specs)\n\nStripe needs to collect certain pieces of information about each account created. These requirements can differ depending on the account’s country. The Country Specs API makes these rules available to your integration.\n\nYou can also view the information from this API call as [an online guide](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information).\n\n## [Person](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/create)[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/update)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/retrieve)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/list)[DELETE/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/delete)\n\n## [Transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/transfers)\n\nA `Transfer` object is created when you move funds between Stripe accounts as part of Connect.\n\nBefore April 6, 2017, transfers also represented movement of funds from a Stripe account to a card or bank account. This behavior has since been split out into a [Payout](#payout_object) object, with corresponding payout endpoints. For more information, read about the [transfer/payout split](https://docs.stripe.com/transfer-payout-split).\n\nRelated guide: [Creating separate charges and transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n\n## [Secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/secret_management)\n\nSecret Store is an API that allows Stripe Apps developers to securely persist secrets for use by UI Extensions and app backends.\n\nThe primary resource in Secret Store is a `secret`. Other apps can’t view secrets created by an app. Additionally, secrets are scoped to provide further permission control.\n\nAll Dashboard users and the app backend share `account` scoped secrets. Use the `account` scope for secrets that don’t change per-user, like a third-party API key.\n\nA `user` scoped secret is accessible by the app backend and one specific Dashboard user. Use the `user` scope for per-user secrets like per-user OAuth tokens, where different users might have different permissions.\n\nRelated guide: [Store data between page reloads](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/store-auth-data-custom-objects)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[GET/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/list)[POST/v1/apps/secrets/delete](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/delete)[GET/v1/apps/secrets/find](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/find)[POST/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/set)\n\n## [Reviews](https://docs.stripe.com/api/radar/reviews)\n\nReviews can be used to supplement automated fraud detection with human expertise.\n\nLearn more about [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar) and reviewing payments [here](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/reviews).\n\n## [Authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/update)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/list)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/approve](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/approve)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/decline](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/decline)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_create)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/capture](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_capture)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/expire](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_expire)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/finalize\\_amount](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_finalize_amount)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/increment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_increment)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/fraud\\_challenges/respond](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/respond_to_fraud_challenges)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/reverse](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_reverse)\n\n## [Cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/create)[POST/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/update)[GET/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/list)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/deliver](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_deliver)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/fail](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_fail)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/return](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_return)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/ship](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_ship)\n\n## [Physical Bundles](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/physical_bundles)\n\nA Physical Bundle represents the bundle of physical items -

For example, WisePOS E is a TerminalHardwareProduct and a WisePOS E - US and WisePOS E - UK are TerminalHardwareSKUs.\n\n## [Terminal Hardware SKU](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_skus)Preview feature\n\nA TerminalHardwareSKU represents a SKU for Terminal hardware. A SKU is a representation of a product available for purchase, containing information such as the name, price, and images.\n\n## [Transaction Entries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/transaction_entries)\n\nTransactionEntries represent individual units of money movements within a single [Transaction](#transactions).\n\n## [Scheduled Queries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/sigma/scheduled_queries)\n\nIf you have [scheduled a Sigma query](https://docs.stripe.com/sigma/scheduled-queries), you’ll receive a `sigma.scheduled_query_run.created` webhook each time the query runs. The webhook contains a `ScheduledQueryRun` object, which you can use to retrieve the query results.\n\n## [Report Types](https://docs.stripe.com/api/reporting/report_type)\n\nThe Report Type resource corresponds to a particular type of report, such as the “Activity summary” or “Itemized payouts” reports. These objects are identified by an ID belonging to a set of enumerated values. See [API Access to Reports documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/reporting/statements/api) for those Report Type IDs, along with required and optional parameters.\n\nNote that certain report types can only be run based on your live-mode data (not test-mode data), and will error when queried without a [live-mode API key](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#test-live-modes).\n\n## [Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/financial_connections/sessions)\n\nA Financial Connections Session is the secure way to programmatically launch the client-side Stripe.js modal that lets your users link their accounts.\n\n## [Verification Report](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_reports)\n\nA VerificationReport is the result of an attempt to collect and verify data from a user. The collection of verification checks performed is determined from the `type` and `options` parameters used. You can find the result of each verification check performed in the appropriate sub-resource: `document`, `id_number`, `selfie`.\n\nEach VerificationReport contains a copy of any data collected by the user as well as reference IDs which can be used to access collected images through the [FileUpload](https://docs.stripe.com/api/files) API. To configure and create VerificationReports, use the [VerificationSession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_sessions) API.\n\nRelated guide: [Accessing verification results](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verification-sessions#results).\n\n## [Crypto Onramp Quotes](https://docs.stripe.com/api/crypto/onramp_quotes)\n\nCrypto Onramp Quotes are estimated quotes for onramp conversions into all the different cryptocurrencies on different networks. The Quotes API allows you to display quotes in your product UI before directing the user to the onramp widget.\n\nRelated guide: [Quotes API](https://docs.stripe.com/crypto/quotes-api)\n\n## [Climate Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/climate/product)\n\nA Climate product represents a type of carbon removal unit available for reservation. You can retrieve it to see the current price and availability.\n\n## [Forwarding Request](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/request)\n\nInstructs Stripe to make a request on your behalf using the destination URL. The destination URL is activated by Stripe at the time of onboarding. Stripe verifies requests with your credentials provided during onboarding, and injects card details from the payment\\_method into the request.\n\nStripe redacts all sensitive fields and headers, including authentication credentials and card numbers, before storing the request and response data in the forwarding Request object, which are subject to a 30-day retention period.\n\nYou can provide a Stripe idempotency key to make sure that requests with the same key result in only one outbound request. The Stripe idempotency key provided should be unique and different from any idempotency keys provided on the underlying third-party request.\n\nForwarding Requests are synchronous requests that return a response or time out according to Stripe’s limits.\n\nRelated guide: [Forward card details to third-party API endpoints](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/forwarding).\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/create)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/retrieve)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/list)",

    "markdown": "# Update a dispute | Stripe API Reference\n\nWhen you get a dispute, contacting your customer is always the best first step. If that doesn’t work, you can submit evidence to help us resolve the dispute in your favor. You can do this in your [dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/disputes), but if you prefer, you can use the API to submit evidence programmatically.\n\nDepending on your dispute type, different evidence fields will give you a better chance of winning your dispute. To figure out which evidence fields to provide, see our [guide to dispute types](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/categories).\n\n### Parameters\n\n*   Evidence to upload, to respond to a dispute. Updating any field in the hash will submit all fields in the hash for review.

This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format. Individual keys can be unset by posting an empty value to them. All keys can be unset by posting an empty value to `metadata`.\n    \n*   Whether to immediately submit evidence to the bank. If `false`, evidence is staged on the dispute.

When an interesting event occurs, we create a new `Event` object. For example, when a charge succeeds, we create a `charge.succeeded` event, and when an invoice payment attempt fails, we create an `invoice.payment_failed` event. Certain API requests might create multiple events. For example, if you create a new subscription for a customer, you receive both a `customer.subscription.created` event and a `charge.succeeded` event.\n\nEvents occur when the state of another API resource changes. The event’s data field embeds the resource’s state at the time of the change. For example, a `charge.succeeded` event contains a charge, and an `invoice.payment_failed` event contains an invoice.\n\nAs with other API resources, you can use endpoints to retrieve an [individual event](#retrieve_event) or a [list of events](#list_events) from the API. We also have a separate [webhooks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook) system for sending the `Event` objects directly to an endpoint on your server. You can manage webhooks in your [account settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/webhooks). Learn how to [listen for events](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks) so that your integration can automatically trigger reactions.\n\nWhen using [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect), you can also receive event notifications that occur in connected accounts. For these events, there’s an additional `account` attribute in the received `Event` object.\n\nWe only guarantee access to events through the [Retrieve Event API](#retrieve_event) for 30 days.\n\n## [Files](https://docs.stripe.com/api/files)\n\nThis object represents files hosted on Stripe’s servers. You can upload files with the [create file](#create_file) request (for example, when uploading dispute evidence). Stripe also creates files independently (for example, the results of a [Sigma scheduled query](#scheduled_queries)).\n\nRelated guide: [File upload guide](https://docs.stripe.com/file-upload)\n\n## [File Links](https://docs.stripe.com/api/file_links)\n\nTo share the contents of a `File` object with non-Stripe users, you can create a `FileLink`. `FileLink`s contain a URL that you can use to retrieve the contents of the file without authentication.\n\n## [Mandates](https://docs.stripe.com/api/mandates)\n\nA Mandate is a record of the permission that your customer gives you to debit their payment method.\n\n## [Setup Attempts](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_attempts)\n\nA SetupAttempt describes one attempted confirmation of a SetupIntent, whether that confirmation is successful or unsuccessful. You can use SetupAttempts to inspect details of a specific attempt at setting up a payment method using a SetupIntent.\n\n## [Confirmation Token](https://docs.stripe.com/api/confirmation_tokens)\n\nConfirmationTokens help transport client side data collected by Stripe JS over to your server for confirming a PaymentIntent or SetupIntent. If the confirmation is successful, values present on the ConfirmationToken are written onto the Intent.\n\nTo learn more about how to use ConfirmationToken, visit the related guides:\n\n*   [Finalize payments on the server](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/finalize-payments-on-the-server)\n*   [Build two-step confirmation](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/build-a-two-step-confirmation).\n\n## [Tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens)\n\nTokenization is the process Stripe uses to collect sensitive card or bank account details, or personally identifiable information (PII), directly from your customers in a secure manner. A token representing this information is returned to your server to use. Use our [recommended payments integrations](https://docs.stripe.com/payments) to perform this process on the client-side. This guarantees that no sensitive card data touches your server, and allows your integration to operate in a PCI-compliant way.\n\nIf you can’t use client-side tokenization, you can also create tokens using the API with either your publishable or secret API key. If your integration uses this method, you’re responsible for any PCI compliance that it might require, and you must keep your secret API key safe. Unlike with client-side tokenization, your customer’s information isn’t sent directly to Stripe, so we can’t determine how it’s handled or stored.\n\nYou can’t store or use tokens more than once. To store card or bank account information for later use, create [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api#customers) objects or [External accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/api#external_accounts). [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar), our integrated solution for automatic fraud protection, performs best with integrations that use client-side tokenization.\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_account)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_bank_account)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_card)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_cvc_update)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_person)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_pii)[GET/v1/tokens/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/retrieve)\n\n## [Cash Balance](https://docs.stripe.com/api/cash_balance)\n\nA customer’s `Cash balance` represents real funds. Customers can add funds to their cash balance by sending a bank transfer. These funds can be used for payment and can eventually be paid out to your bank account.\n\n## [Customer Portal Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customer_portal/sessions)\n\nThe Billing customer portal is a Stripe-hosted UI for subscription and billing management.\n\nA portal configuration describes the functionality and features that you want to provide to your customers through the portal.\n\nA portal session describes the instantiation of the customer portal for a particular customer. By visiting the session’s URL, the customer can manage their subscriptions and billing details. For security reasons, sessions are short-lived and will expire if the customer does not visit the URL. Create sessions on-demand when customers intend to manage their subscriptions and billing details.\n\nRelated guide: [Customer management](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management)\n\n## [Invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices)\n\nInvoices are statements of amounts owed by a customer, and are either generated one-off, or generated periodically from a subscription.\n\nThey contain [invoice items](#invoiceitems), and proration adjustments that may be caused by subscription upgrades/downgrades (if necessary).\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed through automatic charges, Stripe automatically finalizes your invoice and attempts payment. Note that finalizing the invoice, [when automatic](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/automatic-advancement-collection), does not happen immediately as the invoice is created. Stripe waits until one hour after the last webhook was successfully sent (or the last webhook timed out after failing). If you (and the platforms you may have connected to) have no webhooks configured, Stripe waits one hour after creation to finalize the invoice.\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed by sending an email, then based on your [email settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/billing/automatic), Stripe will email the invoice to your customer and await payment. These emails can contain a link to a hosted page to pay the invoice.\n\nStripe applies any customer credit on the account before determining the amount due for the invoice (i.e., the amount that will be actually charged). If the amount due for the invoice is less than Stripe’s [minimum allowed charge per currency](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts), the invoice is automatically marked paid, and we add the amount due to the customer’s credit balance which is applied to the next invoice.\n\nMore details on the customer’s credit balance are [here](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/customer/balance).\n\nRelated guide: [Send invoices to customers](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/invoices/sending)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create)[POST/v1/invoices/create\\_preview](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create_preview)[POST/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/lines/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_line)[GET/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/retrieve)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming)[GET/v1/invoices/:id/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming_invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/list)[DELETE/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/delete)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/add\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/add_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/remove\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/remove_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/update\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/finalize](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/finalize)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/mark\\_uncollectible](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/mark_uncollectible)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/pay](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/pay)[GET/v1/invoices/search](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/search)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/send](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/send)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/void](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/void)\n\n## [Meter Events](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event)\n\nA billing meter event represents a customer’s usage of a product. Meter events are used to bill a customer based on their usage. Meter events are associated with billing meters, which define the shape of the event’s payload and how those events are aggregated for billing.\n\n## [Meter Event Adjustment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_adjustment)\n\nA billing meter event adjustment is a resource that allows you to cancel a meter event. For example, you might create a billing meter event adjustment to cancel a meter event that was created in error or attached to the wrong customer.\n\n## [Meter Event Summary](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_summary)\n\nA billing meter event summary represents an aggregated view of a customer’s billing meter events within a specified timeframe. It indicates how much usage was accrued by a customer for that period.\n\n## [Plans](https://docs.stripe.com/api/plans)\n\nYou can now model subscriptions more flexibly using the [Prices API](#prices). It replaces the Plans API and is backwards compatible to simplify your migration.\n\nPlans define the base price, currency, and billing cycle for recurring purchases of products. [Products](#products) help you track inventory or provisioning, and plans help you track pricing. Different physical goods or levels of service should be represented by products, and pricing options should be represented by plans. This approach lets you change prices without having to change your provisioning scheme.\n\nFor example, you might have a single “gold” product that has plans for $10/month, $100/year, €9/month, and €90/year.\n\nRelated guides: [Set up a subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/set-up-subscription) and more about [products and prices](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/overview).\n\n## [Tax IDs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_create)[POST/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/create)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_retrieve)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/retrieve)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_list)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/list)[DELETE/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_delete)[DELETE/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/delete)\n\n## [Account Links](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_links)\n\nAccount Links are the means by which a Connect platform grants a connected account permission to access Stripe-hosted applications, such as Connect Onboarding.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect Onboarding](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom/hosted-onboarding)\n\n## [Account Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_sessions)\n\nAn AccountSession allows a Connect platform to grant access to a connected account in Connect embedded components.\n\nWe recommend that you create an AccountSession each time you need to display an embedded component to your user. Do not save AccountSessions to your database as they expire relatively quickly, and cannot be used more than once.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect embedded components](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-connect-embedded-components)\n\n## [Application Fees](https://docs.stripe.com/api/application_fees)\n\nWhen you collect a transaction fee on top of a charge made for your user (using [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)), an `Application Fee` object is created in your account. You can list, retrieve, and refund application fees.\n\nRelated guide: [Collecting application fees](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges#collect-fees)\n\n## [Country Specs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/country_specs)\n\nStripe needs to collect certain pieces of information about each account created. These requirements can differ depending on the account’s country. The Country Specs API makes these rules available to your integration.\n\nYou can also view the information from this API call as [an online guide](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information).\n\n## [Person](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/create)[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/update)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/retrieve)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/list)[DELETE/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/delete)\n\n## [Transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/transfers)\n\nA `Transfer` object is created when you move funds between Stripe accounts as part of Connect.\n\nBefore April 6, 2017, transfers also represented movement of funds from a Stripe account to a card or bank account. This behavior has since been split out into a [Payout](#payout_object) object, with corresponding payout endpoints. For more information, read about the [transfer/payout split](https://docs.stripe.com/transfer-payout-split).\n\nRelated guide: [Creating separate charges and transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n\n## [Secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/secret_management)\n\nSecret Store is an API that allows Stripe Apps developers to securely persist secrets for use by UI Extensions and app backends.\n\nThe primary resource in Secret Store is a `secret`. Other apps can’t view secrets created by an app. Additionally, secrets are scoped to provide further permission control.\n\nAll Dashboard users and the app backend share `account` scoped secrets. Use the `account` scope for secrets that don’t change per-user, like a third-party API key.\n\nA `user` scoped secret is accessible by the app backend and one specific Dashboard user. Use the `user` scope for per-user secrets like per-user OAuth tokens, where different users might have different permissions.\n\nRelated guide: [Store data between page reloads](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/store-auth-data-custom-objects)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[GET/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/list)[POST/v1/apps/secrets/delete](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/delete)[GET/v1/apps/secrets/find](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/find)[POST/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/set)\n\n## [Reviews](https://docs.stripe.com/api/radar/reviews)\n\nReviews can be used to supplement automated fraud detection with human expertise.\n\nLearn more about [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar) and reviewing payments [here](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/reviews).\n\n## [Authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/update)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/list)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/approve](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/approve)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/decline](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/decline)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_create)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/capture](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_capture)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/expire](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_expire)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/finalize\\_amount](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_finalize_amount)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/increment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_increment)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/fraud\\_challenges/respond](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/respond_to_fraud_challenges)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/reverse](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_reverse)\n\n## [Cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/create)[POST/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/update)[GET/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/list)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/deliver](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_deliver)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/fail](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_fail)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/return](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_return)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/ship](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_ship)\n\n## [Physical Bundles](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/physical_bundles)\n\nA Physical Bundle represents the bundle of physical items -

For example, WisePOS E is a TerminalHardwareProduct and a WisePOS E - US and WisePOS E - UK are TerminalHardwareSKUs.\n\n## [Terminal Hardware SKU](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_skus)Preview feature\n\nA TerminalHardwareSKU represents a SKU for Terminal hardware. A SKU is a representation of a product available for purchase, containing information such as the name, price, and images.\n\n## [Transaction Entries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/transaction_entries)\n\nTransactionEntries represent individual units of money movements within a single [Transaction](#transactions).\n\n## [Scheduled Queries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/sigma/scheduled_queries)\n\nIf you have [scheduled a Sigma query](https://docs.stripe.com/sigma/scheduled-queries), you’ll receive a `sigma.scheduled_query_run.created` webhook each time the query runs. The webhook contains a `ScheduledQueryRun` object, which you can use to retrieve the query results.\n\n## [Report Types](https://docs.stripe.com/api/reporting/report_type)\n\nThe Report Type resource corresponds to a particular type of report, such as the “Activity summary” or “Itemized payouts” reports. These objects are identified by an ID belonging to a set of enumerated values. See [API Access to Reports documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/reporting/statements/api) for those Report Type IDs, along with required and optional parameters.\n\nNote that certain report types can only be run based on your live-mode data (not test-mode data), and will error when queried without a [live-mode API key](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#test-live-modes).\n\n## [Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/financial_connections/sessions)\n\nA Financial Connections Session is the secure way to programmatically launch the client-side Stripe.js modal that lets your users link their accounts.\n\n## [Verification Report](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_reports)\n\nA VerificationReport is the result of an attempt to collect and verify data from a user. The collection of verification checks performed is determined from the `type` and `options` parameters used. You can find the result of each verification check performed in the appropriate sub-resource: `document`, `id_number`, `selfie`.\n\nEach VerificationReport contains a copy of any data collected by the user as well as reference IDs which can be used to access collected images through the [FileUpload](https://docs.stripe.com/api/files) API. To configure and create VerificationReports, use the [VerificationSession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_sessions) API.\n\nRelated guide: [Accessing verification results](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verification-sessions#results).\n\n## [Crypto Onramp Quotes](https://docs.stripe.com/api/crypto/onramp_quotes)\n\nCrypto Onramp Quotes are estimated quotes for onramp conversions into all the different cryptocurrencies on different networks.

When an interesting event occurs, we create a new `Event` object. For example, when a charge succeeds, we create a `charge.succeeded` event, and when an invoice payment attempt fails, we create an `invoice.payment_failed` event. Certain API requests might create multiple events. For example, if you create a new subscription for a customer, you receive both a `customer.subscription.created` event and a `charge.succeeded` event.\n\nEvents occur when the state of another API resource changes. The event’s data field embeds the resource’s state at the time of the change. For example, a `charge.succeeded` event contains a charge, and an `invoice.payment_failed` event contains an invoice.\n\nAs with other API resources, you can use endpoints to retrieve an [individual event](#retrieve_event) or a [list of events](#list_events) from the API. We also have a separate [webhooks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook) system for sending the `Event` objects directly to an endpoint on your server. You can manage webhooks in your [account settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/webhooks). Learn how to [listen for events](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks) so that your integration can automatically trigger reactions.\n\nWhen using [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect), you can also receive event notifications that occur in connected accounts. For these events, there’s an additional `account` attribute in the received `Event` object.\n\nWe only guarantee access to events through the [Retrieve Event API](#retrieve_event) for 30 days.\n\n## [Files](https://docs.stripe.com/api/files)\n\nThis object represents files hosted on Stripe’s servers. You can upload files with the [create file](#create_file) request (for example, when uploading dispute evidence). Stripe also creates files independently (for example, the results of a [Sigma scheduled query](#scheduled_queries)).\n\nRelated guide: [File upload guide](https://docs.stripe.com/file-upload)\n\n## [File Links](https://docs.stripe.com/api/file_links)\n\nTo share the contents of a `File` object with non-Stripe users, you can create a `FileLink`. `FileLink`s contain a URL that you can use to retrieve the contents of the file without authentication.\n\n## [Mandates](https://docs.stripe.com/api/mandates)\n\nA Mandate is a record of the permission that your customer gives you to debit their payment method.\n\n## [Setup Attempts](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_attempts)\n\nA SetupAttempt describes one attempted confirmation of a SetupIntent, whether that confirmation is successful or unsuccessful. You can use SetupAttempts to inspect details of a specific attempt at setting up a payment method using a SetupIntent.\n\n## [Confirmation Token](https://docs.stripe.com/api/confirmation_tokens)\n\nConfirmationTokens help transport client side data collected by Stripe JS over to your server for confirming a PaymentIntent or SetupIntent. If the confirmation is successful, values present on the ConfirmationToken are written onto the Intent.\n\nTo learn more about how to use ConfirmationToken, visit the related guides:\n\n*   [Finalize payments on the server](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/finalize-payments-on-the-server)\n*   [Build two-step confirmation](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/build-a-two-step-confirmation).\n\n## [Tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens)\n\nTokenization is the process Stripe uses to collect sensitive card or bank account details, or personally identifiable information (PII), directly from your customers in a secure manner. A token representing this information is returned to your server to use. Use our [recommended payments integrations](https://docs.stripe.com/payments) to perform this process on the client-side. This guarantees that no sensitive card data touches your server, and allows your integration to operate in a PCI-compliant way.\n\nIf you can’t use client-side tokenization, you can also create tokens using the API with either your publishable or secret API key. If your integration uses this method, you’re responsible for any PCI compliance that it might require, and you must keep your secret API key safe. Unlike with client-side tokenization, your customer’s information isn’t sent directly to Stripe, so we can’t determine how it’s handled or stored.\n\nYou can’t store or use tokens more than once. To store card or bank account information for later use, create [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api#customers) objects or [External accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/api#external_accounts). [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar), our integrated solution for automatic fraud protection, performs best with integrations that use client-side tokenization.\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_account)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_bank_account)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_card)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_cvc_update)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_person)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_pii)[GET/v1/tokens/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/retrieve)\n\n## [Cash Balance](https://docs.stripe.com/api/cash_balance)\n\nA customer’s `Cash balance` represents real funds. Customers can add funds to their cash balance by sending a bank transfer. These funds can be used for payment and can eventually be paid out to your bank account.\n\n## [Customer Portal Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customer_portal/sessions)\n\nThe Billing customer portal is a Stripe-hosted UI for subscription and billing management.\n\nA portal configuration describes the functionality and features that you want to provide to your customers through the portal.\n\nA portal session describes the instantiation of the customer portal for a particular customer. By visiting the session’s URL, the customer can manage their subscriptions and billing details. For security reasons, sessions are short-lived and will expire if the customer does not visit the URL. Create sessions on-demand when customers intend to manage their subscriptions and billing details.\n\nRelated guide: [Customer management](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management)\n\n## [Invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices)\n\nInvoices are statements of amounts owed by a customer, and are either generated one-off, or generated periodically from a subscription.\n\nThey contain [invoice items](#invoiceitems), and proration adjustments that may be caused by subscription upgrades/downgrades (if necessary).\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed through automatic charges, Stripe automatically finalizes your invoice and attempts payment. Note that finalizing the invoice, [when automatic](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/automatic-advancement-collection), does not happen immediately as the invoice is created. Stripe waits until one hour after the last webhook was successfully sent (or the last webhook timed out after failing). If you (and the platforms you may have connected to) have no webhooks configured, Stripe waits one hour after creation to finalize the invoice.\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed by sending an email, then based on your [email settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/billing/automatic), Stripe will email the invoice to your customer and await payment. These emails can contain a link to a hosted page to pay the invoice.\n\nStripe applies any customer credit on the account before determining the amount due for the invoice (i.e., the amount that will be actually charged). If the amount due for the invoice is less than Stripe’s [minimum allowed charge per currency](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts), the invoice is automatically marked paid, and we add the amount due to the customer’s credit balance which is applied to the next invoice.\n\nMore details on the customer’s credit balance are [here](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/customer/balance).\n\nRelated guide: [Send invoices to customers](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/invoices/sending)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create)[POST/v1/invoices/create\\_preview](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create_preview)[POST/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/lines/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_line)[GET/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/retrieve)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming)[GET/v1/invoices/:id/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming_invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/list)[DELETE/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/delete)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/add\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/add_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/remove\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/remove_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/update\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/finalize](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/finalize)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/mark\\_uncollectible](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/mark_uncollectible)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/pay](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/pay)[GET/v1/invoices/search](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/search)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/send](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/send)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/void](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/void)\n\n## [Meter Events](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event)\n\nA billing meter event represents a customer’s usage of a product. Meter events are used to bill a customer based on their usage. Meter events are associated with billing meters, which define the shape of the event’s payload and how those events are aggregated for billing.\n\n## [Meter Event Adjustment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_adjustment)\n\nA billing meter event adjustment is a resource that allows you to cancel a meter event. For example, you might create a billing meter event adjustment to cancel a meter event that was created in error or attached to the wrong customer.\n\n## [Meter Event Summary](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_summary)\n\nA billing meter event summary represents an aggregated view of a customer’s billing meter events within a specified timeframe. It indicates how much usage was accrued by a customer for that period.\n\n## [Plans](https://docs.stripe.com/api/plans)\n\nYou can now model subscriptions more flexibly using the [Prices API](#prices). It replaces the Plans API and is backwards compatible to simplify your migration.\n\nPlans define the base price, currency, and billing cycle for recurring purchases of products. [Products](#products) help you track inventory or provisioning, and plans help you track pricing. Different physical goods or levels of service should be represented by products, and pricing options should be represented by plans. This approach lets you change prices without having to change your provisioning scheme.\n\nFor example, you might have a single “gold” product that has plans for $10/month, $100/year, €9/month, and €90/year.\n\nRelated guides: [Set up a subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/set-up-subscription) and more about [products and prices](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/overview).\n\n## [Tax IDs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_create)[POST/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/create)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_retrieve)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/retrieve)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_list)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/list)[DELETE/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_delete)[DELETE/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/delete)\n\n## [Account Links](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_links)\n\nAccount Links are the means by which a Connect platform grants a connected account permission to access Stripe-hosted applications, such as Connect Onboarding.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect Onboarding](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom/hosted-onboarding)\n\n## [Account Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_sessions)\n\nAn AccountSession allows a Connect platform to grant access to a connected account in Connect embedded components.\n\nWe recommend that you create an AccountSession each time you need to display an embedded component to your user. Do not save AccountSessions to your database as they expire relatively quickly, and cannot be used more than once.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect embedded components](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-connect-embedded-components)\n\n## [Application Fees](https://docs.stripe.com/api/application_fees)\n\nWhen you collect a transaction fee on top of a charge made for your user (using [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)), an `Application Fee` object is created in your account. You can list, retrieve, and refund application fees.\n\nRelated guide: [Collecting application fees](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges#collect-fees)\n\n## [Country Specs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/country_specs)\n\nStripe needs to collect certain pieces of information about each account created. These requirements can differ depending on the account’s country. The Country Specs API makes these rules available to your integration.\n\nYou can also view the information from this API call as [an online guide](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information).\n\n## [Person](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/create)[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/update)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/retrieve)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/list)[DELETE/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/delete)\n\n## [Transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/transfers)\n\nA `Transfer` object is created when you move funds between Stripe accounts as part of Connect.\n\nBefore April 6, 2017, transfers also represented movement of funds from a Stripe account to a card or bank account. This behavior has since been split out into a [Payout](#payout_object) object, with corresponding payout endpoints. For more information, read about the [transfer/payout split](https://docs.stripe.com/transfer-payout-split).\n\nRelated guide: [Creating separate charges and transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n\n## [Secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/secret_management)\n\nSecret Store is an API that allows Stripe Apps developers to securely persist secrets for use by UI Extensions and app backends.\n\nThe primary resource in Secret Store is a `secret`. Other apps can’t view secrets created by an app. Additionally, secrets are scoped to provide further permission control.\n\nAll Dashboard users and the app backend share `account` scoped secrets. Use the `account` scope for secrets that don’t change per-user, like a third-party API key.\n\nA `user` scoped secret is accessible by the app backend and one specific Dashboard user. Use the `user` scope for per-user secrets like per-user OAuth tokens, where different users might have different permissions.\n\nRelated guide: [Store data between page reloads](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/store-auth-data-custom-objects)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[GET/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/list)[POST/v1/apps/secrets/delete](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/delete)[GET/v1/apps/secrets/find](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/find)[POST/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/set)\n\n## [Reviews](https://docs.stripe.com/api/radar/reviews)\n\nReviews can be used to supplement automated fraud detection with human expertise.\n\nLearn more about [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar) and reviewing payments [here](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/reviews).\n\n## [Authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/update)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/list)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/approve](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/approve)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/decline](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/decline)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_create)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/capture](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_capture)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/expire](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_expire)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/finalize\\_amount](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_finalize_amount)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/increment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_increment)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/fraud\\_challenges/respond](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/respond_to_fraud_challenges)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/reverse](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_reverse)\n\n## [Cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/create)[POST/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/update)[GET/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/list)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/deliver](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_deliver)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/fail](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_fail)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/return](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_return)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/ship](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_ship)\n\n## [Physical Bundles](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/physical_bundles)\n\nA Physical Bundle represents the bundle of physical items - card stock, carrier letter, and envelope - that is shipped to a cardholder when you create a physical card.\n\n## [Reader](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/terminal/readers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/create)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/update)[GET/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/retrieve)[GET/v1/terminal/readers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/list)[DELETE/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/delete)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/cancel\\_action](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/cancel_action)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/collect\\_inputs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/collect_inputs)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/confirm\\_payment\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/confirm_payment_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/collect\\_payment\\_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/collect_payment_method)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/process\\_payment\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/process_payment_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/process\\_setup\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/process_setup_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/refund\\_payment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/refund_payment)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/set\\_reader\\_display](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/set_reader_display)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/terminal/readers/:id/present\\_payment\\_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/present_payment_method)\n\n## [Terminal Hardware Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_products)Preview feature\n\nA TerminalHardwareProduct is a category of hardware devices that are generally similar, but may have variations depending on the country it’s shipped to.\n\nTerminalHardwareSKUs represent variations within the same Product (for example, a country specific device). For example, WisePOS E is a TerminalHardwareProduct and a WisePOS E - US and WisePOS E - UK are TerminalHardwareSKUs.\n\n## [Terminal Hardware SKU](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_skus)Preview feature\n\nA TerminalHardwareSKU represents a SKU for Terminal hardware. A SKU is a representation of a product available for purchase, containing information such as the name, price, and images.\n\n## [Transaction Entries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/transaction_entries)\n\nTransactionEntries represent individual units of money movements within a single [Transaction](#transactions).\n\n## [Scheduled Queries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/sigma/scheduled_queries)\n\nIf you have [scheduled a Sigma query](https://docs.stripe.com/sigma/scheduled-queries), you’ll receive a `sigma.scheduled_query_run.created` webhook each time the query runs. The webhook contains a `ScheduledQueryRun` object, which you can use to retrieve the query results.\n\n## [Report Types](https://docs.stripe.com/api/reporting/report_type)\n\nThe Report Type resource corresponds to a particular type of report, such as the “Activity summary” or “Itemized payouts” reports. These objects are identified by an ID belonging to a set of enumerated values. See [API Access to Reports documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/reporting/statements/api) for those Report Type IDs, along with required and optional parameters.\n\nNote that certain report types can only be run based on your live-mode data (not test-mode data), and will error when queried without a [live-mode API key](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#test-live-modes).\n\n## [Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/financial_connections/sessions)\n\nA Financial Connections Session is the secure way to programmatically launch the client-side Stripe.js modal that lets your users link their accounts.\n\n## [Verification Report](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_reports)\n\nA VerificationReport is the result of an attempt to collect and verify data from a user. The collection of verification checks performed is determined from the `type` and `options` parameters used. You can find the result of each verification check performed in the appropriate sub-resource: `document`, `id_number`, `selfie`.\n\nEach VerificationReport contains a copy of any data collected by the user as well as reference IDs which can be used to access collected images through the [FileUpload](https://docs.stripe.com/api/files) API. To configure and create VerificationReports, use the [VerificationSession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_sessions) API.\n\nRelated guide: [Accessing verification results](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verification-sessions#results).\n\n## [Crypto Onramp Quotes](https://docs.stripe.com/api/crypto/onramp_quotes)\n\nCrypto Onramp Quotes are estimated quotes for onramp conversions into all the different cryptocurrencies on different networks. The Quotes API allows you to display quotes in your product UI before directing the user to the onramp widget.\n\nRelated guide: [Quotes API](https://docs.stripe.com/crypto/quotes-api)\n\n## [Climate Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/climate/product)\n\nA Climate product represents a type of carbon removal unit available for reservation. You can retrieve it to see the current price and availability.\n\n## [Forwarding Request](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/request)\n\nInstructs Stripe to make a request on your behalf using the destination URL. The destination URL is activated by Stripe at the time of onboarding. Stripe verifies requests with your credentials provided during onboarding, and injects card details from the payment\\_method into the request.\n\nStripe redacts all sensitive fields and headers, including authentication credentials and card numbers, before storing the request and response data in the forwarding Request object, which are subject to a 30-day retention period.\n\nYou can provide a Stripe idempotency key to make sure that requests with the same key result in only one outbound request. The Stripe idempotency key provided should be unique and different from any idempotency keys provided on the underlying third-party request.\n\nForwarding Requests are synchronous requests that return a response or time out according to Stripe’s limits.\n\nRelated guide: [Forward card details to third-party API endpoints](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/forwarding).\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/create)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/retrieve)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/list)",

When an interesting event occurs, we create a new `Event` object. For example, when a charge succeeds, we create a `charge.succeeded` event, and when an invoice payment attempt fails, we create an `invoice.payment_failed` event. Certain API requests might create multiple events. For example, if you create a new subscription for a customer, you receive both a `customer.subscription.created` event and a `charge.succeeded` event.\n\nEvents occur when the state of another API resource changes. The event’s data field embeds the resource’s state at the time of the change. For example, a `charge.succeeded` event contains a charge, and an `invoice.payment_failed` event contains an invoice.\n\nAs with other API resources, you can use endpoints to retrieve an [individual event](#retrieve_event) or a [list of events](#list_events) from the API. We also have a separate [webhooks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook) system for sending the `Event` objects directly to an endpoint on your server. You can manage webhooks in your [account settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/webhooks). Learn how to [listen for events](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks) so that your integration can automatically trigger reactions.\n\nWhen using [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect), you can also receive event notifications that occur in connected accounts. For these events, there’s an additional `account` attribute in the received `Event` object.\n\nWe only guarantee access to events through the [Retrieve Event API](#retrieve_event) for 30 days.\n\n## [Files](https://docs.stripe.com/api/files)\n\nThis object represents files hosted on Stripe’s servers. You can upload files with the [create file](#create_file) request (for example, when uploading dispute evidence). Stripe also creates files independently (for example, the results of a [Sigma scheduled query](#scheduled_queries)).\n\nRelated guide: [File upload guide](https://docs.stripe.com/file-upload)\n\n## [File Links](https://docs.stripe.com/api/file_links)\n\nTo share the contents of a `File` object with non-Stripe users, you can create a `FileLink`. `FileLink`s contain a URL that you can use to retrieve the contents of the file without authentication.\n\n## [Mandates](https://docs.stripe.com/api/mandates)\n\nA Mandate is a record of the permission that your customer gives you to debit their payment method.\n\n## [Setup Attempts](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_attempts)\n\nA SetupAttempt describes one attempted confirmation of a SetupIntent, whether that confirmation is successful or unsuccessful. You can use SetupAttempts to inspect details of a specific attempt at setting up a payment method using a SetupIntent.\n\n## [Confirmation Token](https://docs.stripe.com/api/confirmation_tokens)\n\nConfirmationTokens help transport client side data collected by Stripe JS over to your server for confirming a PaymentIntent or SetupIntent. If the confirmation is successful, values present on the ConfirmationToken are written onto the Intent.\n\nTo learn more about how to use ConfirmationToken, visit the related guides:\n\n*   [Finalize payments on the server](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/finalize-payments-on-the-server)\n*   [Build two-step confirmation](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/build-a-two-step-confirmation).\n\n## [Tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens)\n\nTokenization is the process Stripe uses to collect sensitive card or bank account details, or personally identifiable information (PII), directly from your customers in a secure manner. A token representing this information is returned to your server to use. Use our [recommended payments integrations](https://docs.stripe.com/payments) to perform this process on the client-side. This guarantees that no sensitive card data touches your server, and allows your integration to operate in a PCI-compliant way.\n\nIf you can’t use client-side tokenization, you can also create tokens using the API with either your publishable or secret API key. If your integration uses this method, you’re responsible for any PCI compliance that it might require, and you must keep your secret API key safe. Unlike with client-side tokenization, your customer’s information isn’t sent directly to Stripe, so we can’t determine how it’s handled or stored.\n\nYou can’t store or use tokens more than once. To store card or bank account information for later use, create [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api#customers) objects or [External accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/api#external_accounts). [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar), our integrated solution for automatic fraud protection, performs best with integrations that use client-side tokenization.\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_account)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_bank_account)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_card)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_cvc_update)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_person)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_pii)[GET/v1/tokens/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/retrieve)\n\n## [Cash Balance](https://docs.stripe.com/api/cash_balance)\n\nA customer’s `Cash balance` represents real funds. Customers can add funds to their cash balance by sending a bank transfer. These funds can be used for payment and can eventually be paid out to your bank account.\n\n## [Customer Portal Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customer_portal/sessions)\n\nThe Billing customer portal is a Stripe-hosted UI for subscription and billing management.\n\nA portal configuration describes the functionality and features that you want to provide to your customers through the portal.\n\nA portal session describes the instantiation of the customer portal for a particular customer. By visiting the session’s URL, the customer can manage their subscriptions and billing details. For security reasons, sessions are short-lived and will expire if the customer does not visit the URL. Create sessions on-demand when customers intend to manage their subscriptions and billing details.\n\nRelated guide: [Customer management](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management)\n\n## [Invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices)\n\nInvoices are statements of amounts owed by a customer, and are either generated one-off, or generated periodically from a subscription.\n\nThey contain [invoice items](#invoiceitems), and proration adjustments that may be caused by subscription upgrades/downgrades (if necessary).\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed through automatic charges, Stripe automatically finalizes your invoice and attempts payment. Note that finalizing the invoice, [when automatic](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/automatic-advancement-collection), does not happen immediately as the invoice is created. Stripe waits until one hour after the last webhook was successfully sent (or the last webhook timed out after failing). If you (and the platforms you may have connected to) have no webhooks configured, Stripe waits one hour after creation to finalize the invoice.\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed by sending an email, then based on your [email settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/billing/automatic), Stripe will email the invoice to your customer and await payment. These emails can contain a link to a hosted page to pay the invoice.\n\nStripe applies any customer credit on the account before determining the amount due for the invoice (i.e., the amount that will be actually charged). If the amount due for the invoice is less than Stripe’s [minimum allowed charge per currency](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts), the invoice is automatically marked paid, and we add the amount due to the customer’s credit balance which is applied to the next invoice.\n\nMore details on the customer’s credit balance are [here](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/customer/balance).\n\nRelated guide: [Send invoices to customers](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/invoices/sending)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create)[POST/v1/invoices/create\\_preview](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create_preview)[POST/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/lines/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_line)[GET/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/retrieve)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming)[GET/v1/invoices/:id/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming_invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/list)[DELETE/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/delete)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/add\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/add_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/remove\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/remove_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/update\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/finalize](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/finalize)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/mark\\_uncollectible](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/mark_uncollectible)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/pay](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/pay)[GET/v1/invoices/search](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/search)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/send](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/send)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/void](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/void)\n\n## [Meter Events](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event)\n\nA billing meter event represents a customer’s usage of a product. Meter events are used to bill a customer based on their usage. Meter events are associated with billing meters, which define the shape of the event’s payload and how those events are aggregated for billing.\n\n## [Meter Event Adjustment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_adjustment)\n\nA billing meter event adjustment is a resource that allows you to cancel a meter event. For example, you might create a billing meter event adjustment to cancel a meter event that was created in error or attached to the wrong customer.\n\n## [Meter Event Summary](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_summary)\n\nA billing meter event summary represents an aggregated view of a customer’s billing meter events within a specified timeframe. It indicates how much usage was accrued by a customer for that period.\n\n## [Plans](https://docs.stripe.com/api/plans)\n\nYou can now model subscriptions more flexibly using the [Prices API](#prices). It replaces the Plans API and is backwards compatible to simplify your migration.\n\nPlans define the base price, currency, and billing cycle for recurring purchases of products. [Products](#products) help you track inventory or provisioning, and plans help you track pricing. Different physical goods or levels of service should be represented by products, and pricing options should be represented by plans. This approach lets you change prices without having to change your provisioning scheme.\n\nFor example, you might have a single “gold” product that has plans for $10/month, $100/year, €9/month, and €90/year.\n\nRelated guides: [Set up a subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/set-up-subscription) and more about [products and prices](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/overview).\n\n## [Tax IDs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_create)[POST/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/create)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_retrieve)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/retrieve)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_list)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/list)[DELETE/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_delete)[DELETE/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/delete)\n\n## [Account Links](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_links)\n\nAccount Links are the means by which a Connect platform grants a connected account permission to access Stripe-hosted applications, such as Connect Onboarding.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect Onboarding](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom/hosted-onboarding)\n\n## [Account Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_sessions)\n\nAn AccountSession allows a Connect platform to grant access to a connected account in Connect embedded components.\n\nWe recommend that you create an AccountSession each time you need to display an embedded component to your user. Do not save AccountSessions to your database as they expire relatively quickly, and cannot be used more than once.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect embedded components](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-connect-embedded-components)\n\n## [Application Fees](https://docs.stripe.com/api/application_fees)\n\nWhen you collect a transaction fee on top of a charge made for your user (using [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)), an `Application Fee` object is created in your account. You can list, retrieve, and refund application fees.\n\nRelated guide: [Collecting application fees](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges#collect-fees)\n\n## [Country Specs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/country_specs)\n\nStripe needs to collect certain pieces of information about each account created. These requirements can differ depending on the account’s country. The Country Specs API makes these rules available to your integration.\n\nYou can also view the information from this API call as [an online guide](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information).\n\n## [Person](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/create)[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/update)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/retrieve)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/list)[DELETE/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/delete)\n\n## [Transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/transfers)\n\nA `Transfer` object is created when you move funds between Stripe accounts as part of Connect.\n\nBefore April 6, 2017, transfers also represented movement of funds from a Stripe account to a card or bank account. This behavior has since been split out into a [Payout](#payout_object) object, with corresponding payout endpoints. For more information, read about the [transfer/payout split](https://docs.stripe.com/transfer-payout-split).\n\nRelated guide: [Creating separate charges and transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n\n## [Secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/secret_management)\n\nSecret Store is an API that allows Stripe Apps developers to securely persist secrets for use by UI Extensions and app backends.\n\nThe primary resource in Secret Store is a `secret`. Other apps can’t view secrets created by an app. Additionally, secrets are scoped to provide further permission control.\n\nAll Dashboard users and the app backend share `account` scoped secrets. Use the `account` scope for secrets that don’t change per-user, like a third-party API key.\n\nA `user` scoped secret is accessible by the app backend and one specific Dashboard user. Use the `user` scope for per-user secrets like per-user OAuth tokens, where different users might have different permissions.\n\nRelated guide: [Store data between page reloads](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/store-auth-data-custom-objects)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[GET/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/list)[POST/v1/apps/secrets/delete](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/delete)[GET/v1/apps/secrets/find](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/find)[POST/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/set)\n\n## [Reviews](https://docs.stripe.com/api/radar/reviews)\n\nReviews can be used to supplement automated fraud detection with human expertise.\n\nLearn more about [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar) and reviewing payments [here](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/reviews).\n\n## [Authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/update)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/list)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/approve](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/approve)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/decline](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/decline)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_create)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/capture](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_capture)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/expire](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_expire)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/finalize\\_amount](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_finalize_amount)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/increment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_increment)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/fraud\\_challenges/respond](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/respond_to_fraud_challenges)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/reverse](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_reverse)\n\n## [Cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/create)[POST/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/update)[GET/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/list)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/deliver](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_deliver)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/fail](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_fail)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/return](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_return)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/ship](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_ship)\n\n## [Physical Bundles](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/physical_bundles)\n\nA Physical Bundle represents the bundle of physical items - card stock, carrier letter, and envelope - that is shipped to a cardholder when you create a physical card.\n\n## [Reader](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/terminal/readers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/create)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/update)[GET/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/retrieve)[GET/v1/terminal/readers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/list)[DELETE/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/delete)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/cancel\\_action](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/cancel_action)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/collect\\_inputs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/collect_inputs)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/confirm\\_payment\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/confirm_payment_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/collect\\_payment\\_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/collect_payment_method)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/process\\_payment\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/process_payment_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/process\\_setup\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/process_setup_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/refund\\_payment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/refund_payment)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/set\\_reader\\_display](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/set_reader_display)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/terminal/readers/:id/present\\_payment\\_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/present_payment_method)\n\n## [Terminal Hardware Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_products)Preview feature\n\nA TerminalHardwareProduct is a category of hardware devices that are generally similar, but may have variations depending on the country it’s shipped to.\n\nTerminalHardwareSKUs represent variations within the same Product (for example, a country specific device). For example, WisePOS E is a TerminalHardwareProduct and a WisePOS E - US and WisePOS E - UK are TerminalHardwareSKUs.\n\n## [Terminal Hardware SKU](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_skus)Preview feature\n\nA TerminalHardwareSKU represents a SKU for Terminal hardware. A SKU is a representation of a product available for purchase, containing information such as the name, price, and images.\n\n## [Transaction Entries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/transaction_entries)\n\nTransactionEntries represent individual units of money movements within a single [Transaction](#transactions).\n\n## [Scheduled Queries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/sigma/scheduled_queries)\n\nIf you have [scheduled a Sigma query](https://docs.stripe.com/sigma/scheduled-queries), you’ll receive a `sigma.scheduled_query_run.created` webhook each time the query runs. The webhook contains a `ScheduledQueryRun` object, which you can use to retrieve the query results.\n\n## [Report Types](https://docs.stripe.com/api/reporting/report_type)\n\nThe Report Type resource corresponds to a particular type of report, such as the “Activity summary” or “Itemized payouts” reports. These objects are identified by an ID belonging to a set of enumerated values. See [API Access to Reports documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/reporting/statements/api) for those Report Type IDs, along with required and optional parameters.\n\nNote that certain report types can only be run based on your live-mode data (not test-mode data), and will error when queried without a [live-mode API key](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#test-live-modes).\n\n## [Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/financial_connections/sessions)\n\nA Financial Connections Session is the secure way to programmatically launch the client-side Stripe.js modal that lets your users link their accounts.\n\n## [Verification Report](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_reports)\n\nA VerificationReport is the result of an attempt to collect and verify data from a user. The collection of verification checks performed is determined from the `type` and `options` parameters used. You can find the result of each verification check performed in the appropriate sub-resource: `document`, `id_number`, `selfie`.\n\nEach VerificationReport contains a copy of any data collected by the user as well as reference IDs which can be used to access collected images through the [FileUpload](https://docs.stripe.com/api/files) API. To configure and create VerificationReports, use the [VerificationSession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_sessions) API.\n\nRelated guide: [Accessing verification results](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verification-sessions#results).\n\n## [Crypto Onramp Quotes](https://docs.stripe.com/api/crypto/onramp_quotes)\n\nCrypto Onramp Quotes are estimated quotes for onramp conversions into all the different cryptocurrencies on different networks. The Quotes API allows you to display quotes in your product UI before directing the user to the onramp widget.\n\nRelated guide: [Quotes API](https://docs.stripe.com/crypto/quotes-api)\n\n## [Climate Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/climate/product)\n\nA Climate product represents a type of carbon removal unit available for reservation. You can retrieve it to see the current price and availability.\n\n## [Forwarding Request](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/request)\n\nInstructs Stripe to make a request on your behalf using the destination URL. The destination URL is activated by Stripe at the time of onboarding. Stripe verifies requests with your credentials provided during onboarding, and injects card details from the payment\\_method into the request.\n\nStripe redacts all sensitive fields and headers, including authentication credentials and card numbers, before storing the request and response data in the forwarding Request object, which are subject to a 30-day retention period.\n\nYou can provide a Stripe idempotency key to make sure that requests with the same key result in only one outbound request. The Stripe idempotency key provided should be unique and different from any idempotency keys provided on the underlying third-party request.\n\nForwarding Requests are synchronous requests that return a response or time out according to Stripe’s limits.\n\nRelated guide: [Forward card details to third-party API endpoints](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/forwarding).\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/create)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/retrieve)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/list)",

When an interesting event occurs, we create a new `Event` object. For example, when a charge succeeds, we create a `charge.succeeded` event, and when an invoice payment attempt fails, we create an `invoice.payment_failed` event. Certain API requests might create multiple events. For example, if you create a new subscription for a customer, you receive both a `customer.subscription.created` event and a `charge.succeeded` event.\n\nEvents occur when the state of another API resource changes. The event’s data field embeds the resource’s state at the time of the change. For example, a `charge.succeeded` event contains a charge, and an `invoice.payment_failed` event contains an invoice.\n\nAs with other API resources, you can use endpoints to retrieve an [individual event](#retrieve_event) or a [list of events](#list_events) from the API. We also have a separate [webhooks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook) system for sending the `Event` objects directly to an endpoint on your server. You can manage webhooks in your [account settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/webhooks). Learn how to [listen for events](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks) so that your integration can automatically trigger reactions.\n\nWhen using [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect), you can also receive event notifications that occur in connected accounts. For these events, there’s an additional `account` attribute in the received `Event` object.\n\nWe only guarantee access to events through the [Retrieve Event API](#retrieve_event) for 30 days.\n\n## [Files](https://docs.stripe.com/api/files)\n\nThis object represents files hosted on Stripe’s servers. You can upload files with the [create file](#create_file) request (for example, when uploading dispute evidence). Stripe also creates files independently (for example, the results of a [Sigma scheduled query](#scheduled_queries)).\n\nRelated guide: [File upload guide](https://docs.stripe.com/file-upload)\n\n## [File Links](https://docs.stripe.com/api/file_links)\n\nTo share the contents of a `File` object with non-Stripe users, you can create a `FileLink`. `FileLink`s contain a URL that you can use to retrieve the contents of the file without authentication.\n\n## [Mandates](https://docs.stripe.com/api/mandates)\n\nA Mandate is a record of the permission that your customer gives you to debit their payment method.\n\n## [Setup Attempts](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_attempts)\n\nA SetupAttempt describes one attempted confirmation of a SetupIntent, whether that confirmation is successful or unsuccessful. You can use SetupAttempts to inspect details of a specific attempt at setting up a payment method using a SetupIntent.\n\n## [Confirmation Token](https://docs.stripe.com/api/confirmation_tokens)\n\nConfirmationTokens help transport client side data collected by Stripe JS over to your server for confirming a PaymentIntent or SetupIntent. If the confirmation is successful, values present on the ConfirmationToken are written onto the Intent.\n\nTo learn more about how to use ConfirmationToken, visit the related guides:\n\n*   [Finalize payments on the server](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/finalize-payments-on-the-server)\n*   [Build two-step confirmation](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/build-a-two-step-confirmation).\n\n## [Tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens)\n\nTokenization is the process Stripe uses to collect sensitive card or bank account details, or personally identifiable information (PII), directly from your customers in a secure manner. A token representing this information is returned to your server to use. Use our [recommended payments integrations](https://docs.stripe.com/payments) to perform this process on the client-side. This guarantees that no sensitive card data touches your server, and allows your integration to operate in a PCI-compliant way.\n\nIf you can’t use client-side tokenization, you can also create tokens using the API with either your publishable or secret API key. If your integration uses this method, you’re responsible for any PCI compliance that it might require, and you must keep your secret API key safe. Unlike with client-side tokenization, your customer’s information isn’t sent directly to Stripe, so we can’t determine how it’s handled or stored.\n\nYou can’t store or use tokens more than once. To store card or bank account information for later use, create [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api#customers) objects or [External accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/api#external_accounts). [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar), our integrated solution for automatic fraud protection, performs best with integrations that use client-side tokenization.\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_account)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_bank_account)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_card)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_cvc_update)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_person)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_pii)[GET/v1/tokens/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/retrieve)\n\n## [Cash Balance](https://docs.stripe.com/api/cash_balance)\n\nA customer’s `Cash balance` represents real funds. Customers can add funds to their cash balance by sending a bank transfer. These funds can be used for payment and can eventually be paid out to your bank account.\n\n## [Customer Portal Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customer_portal/sessions)\n\nThe Billing customer portal is a Stripe-hosted UI for subscription and billing management.\n\nA portal configuration describes the functionality and features that you want to provide to your customers through the portal.\n\nA portal session describes the instantiation of the customer portal for a particular customer. By visiting the session’s URL, the customer can manage their subscriptions and billing details. For security reasons, sessions are short-lived and will expire if the customer does not visit the URL. Create sessions on-demand when customers intend to manage their subscriptions and billing details.\n\nRelated guide: [Customer management](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management)\n\n## [Invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices)\n\nInvoices are statements of amounts owed by a customer, and are either generated one-off, or generated periodically from a subscription.\n\nThey contain [invoice items](#invoiceitems), and proration adjustments that may be caused by subscription upgrades/downgrades (if necessary).\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed through automatic charges, Stripe automatically finalizes your invoice and attempts payment. Note that finalizing the invoice, [when automatic](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/automatic-advancement-collection), does not happen immediately as the invoice is created. Stripe waits until one hour after the last webhook was successfully sent (or the last webhook timed out after failing). If you (and the platforms you may have connected to) have no webhooks configured, Stripe waits one hour after creation to finalize the invoice.\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed by sending an email, then based on your [email settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/billing/automatic), Stripe will email the invoice to your customer and await payment. These emails can contain a link to a hosted page to pay the invoice.\n\nStripe applies any customer credit on the account before determining the amount due for the invoice (i.e., the amount that will be actually charged). If the amount due for the invoice is less than Stripe’s [minimum allowed charge per currency](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts), the invoice is automatically marked paid, and we add the amount due to the customer’s credit balance which is applied to the next invoice.\n\nMore details on the customer’s credit balance are [here](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/customer/balance).\n\nRelated guide: [Send invoices to customers](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/invoices/sending)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create)[POST/v1/invoices/create\\_preview](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create_preview)[POST/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/lines/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_line)[GET/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/retrieve)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming)[GET/v1/invoices/:id/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming_invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/list)[DELETE/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/delete)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/add\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/add_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/remove\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/remove_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/update\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/finalize](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/finalize)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/mark\\_uncollectible](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/mark_uncollectible)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/pay](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/pay)[GET/v1/invoices/search](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/search)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/send](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/send)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/void](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/void)\n\n## [Meter Events](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event)\n\nA billing meter event represents a customer’s usage of a product. Meter events are used to bill a customer based on their usage. Meter events are associated with billing meters, which define the shape of the event’s payload and how those events are aggregated for billing.\n\n## [Meter Event Adjustment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_adjustment)\n\nA billing meter event adjustment is a resource that allows you to cancel a meter event. For example, you might create a billing meter event adjustment to cancel a meter event that was created in error or attached to the wrong customer.\n\n## [Meter Event Summary](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_summary)\n\nA billing meter event summary represents an aggregated view of a customer’s billing meter events within a specified timeframe. It indicates how much usage was accrued by a customer for that period.\n\n## [Plans](https://docs.stripe.com/api/plans)\n\nYou can now model subscriptions more flexibly using the [Prices API](#prices). It replaces the Plans API and is backwards compatible to simplify your migration.\n\nPlans define the base price, currency, and billing cycle for recurring purchases of products. [Products](#products) help you track inventory or provisioning, and plans help you track pricing. Different physical goods or levels of service should be represented by products, and pricing options should be represented by plans. This approach lets you change prices without having to change your provisioning scheme.\n\nFor example, you might have a single “gold” product that has plans for $10/month, $100/year, €9/month, and €90/year.\n\nRelated guides: [Set up a subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/set-up-subscription) and more about [products and prices](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/overview).\n\n## [Tax IDs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_create)[POST/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/create)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_retrieve)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/retrieve)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_list)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/list)[DELETE/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_delete)[DELETE/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/delete)\n\n## [Account Links](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_links)\n\nAccount Links are the means by which a Connect platform grants a connected account permission to access Stripe-hosted applications, such as Connect Onboarding.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect Onboarding](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom/hosted-onboarding)\n\n## [Account Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_sessions)\n\nAn AccountSession allows a Connect platform to grant access to a connected account in Connect embedded components.\n\nWe recommend that you create an AccountSession each time you need to display an embedded component to your user. Do not save AccountSessions to your database as they expire relatively quickly, and cannot be used more than once.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect embedded components](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-connect-embedded-components)\n\n## [Application Fees](https://docs.stripe.com/api/application_fees)\n\nWhen you collect a transaction fee on top of a charge made for your user (using [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)), an `Application Fee` object is created in your account. You can list, retrieve, and refund application fees.\n\nRelated guide: [Collecting application fees](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges#collect-fees)\n\n## [Country Specs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/country_specs)\n\nStripe needs to collect certain pieces of information about each account created. These requirements can differ depending on the account’s country. The Country Specs API makes these rules available to your integration.\n\nYou can also view the information from this API call as [an online guide](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information).\n\n## [Person](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/create)[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/update)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/retrieve)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/list)[DELETE/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/delete)\n\n## [Transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/transfers)\n\nA `Transfer` object is created when you move funds between Stripe accounts as part of Connect.\n\nBefore April 6, 2017, transfers also represented movement of funds from a Stripe account to a card or bank account. This behavior has since been split out into a [Payout](#payout_object) object, with corresponding payout endpoints. For more information, read about the [transfer/payout split](https://docs.stripe.com/transfer-payout-split).\n\nRelated guide: [Creating separate charges and transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n\n## [Secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/secret_management)\n\nSecret Store is an API that allows Stripe Apps developers to securely persist secrets for use by UI Extensions and app backends.\n\nThe primary resource in Secret Store is a `secret`. Other apps can’t view secrets created by an app. Additionally, secrets are scoped to provide further permission control.\n\nAll Dashboard users and the app backend share `account` scoped secrets. Use the `account` scope for secrets that don’t change per-user, like a third-party API key.\n\nA `user` scoped secret is accessible by the app backend and one specific Dashboard user. Use the `user` scope for per-user secrets like per-user OAuth tokens, where different users might have different permissions.\n\nRelated guide: [Store data between page reloads](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/store-auth-data-custom-objects)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[GET/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/list)[POST/v1/apps/secrets/delete](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/delete)[GET/v1/apps/secrets/find](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/find)[POST/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/set)\n\n## [Reviews](https://docs.stripe.com/api/radar/reviews)\n\nReviews can be used to supplement automated fraud detection with human expertise.\n\nLearn more about [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar) and reviewing payments [here](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/reviews).\n\n## [Authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/update)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/list)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/approve](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/approve)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/decline](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/decline)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_create)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/capture](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_capture)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/expire](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_expire)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/finalize\\_amount](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_finalize_amount)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/increment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_increment)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/fraud\\_challenges/respond](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/respond_to_fraud_challenges)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/reverse](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_reverse)\n\n## [Cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/create)[POST/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/update)[GET/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/list)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/deliver](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_deliver)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/fail](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_fail)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/return](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_return)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/ship](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_ship)\n\n## [Physical Bundles](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/physical_bundles)\n\nA Physical Bundle represents the bundle of physical items - card stock, carrier letter, and envelope - that is shipped to a cardholder when you create a physical card.\n\n## [Reader](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/terminal/readers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/create)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/update)[GET/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/retrieve)[GET/v1/terminal/readers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/list)[DELETE/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/delete)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/cancel\\_action](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/cancel_action)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/collect\\_inputs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/collect_inputs)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/confirm\\_payment\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/confirm_payment_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/collect\\_payment\\_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/collect_payment_method)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/process\\_payment\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/process_payment_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/process\\_setup\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/process_setup_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/refund\\_payment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/refund_payment)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/set\\_reader\\_display](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/set_reader_display)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/terminal/readers/:id/present\\_payment\\_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/present_payment_method)\n\n## [Terminal Hardware Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_products)Preview feature\n\nA TerminalHardwareProduct is a category of hardware devices that are generally similar, but may have variations depending on the country it’s shipped to.\n\nTerminalHardwareSKUs represent variations within the same Product (for example, a country specific device). For example, WisePOS E is a TerminalHardwareProduct and a WisePOS E - US and WisePOS E - UK are TerminalHardwareSKUs.\n\n## [Terminal Hardware SKU](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_skus)Preview feature\n\nA TerminalHardwareSKU represents a SKU for Terminal hardware. A SKU is a representation of a product available for purchase, containing information such as the name, price, and images.\n\n## [Transaction Entries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/transaction_entries)\n\nTransactionEntries represent individual units of money movements within a single [Transaction](#transactions).\n\n## [Scheduled Queries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/sigma/scheduled_queries)\n\nIf you have [scheduled a Sigma query](https://docs.stripe.com/sigma/scheduled-queries), you’ll receive a `sigma.scheduled_query_run.created` webhook each time the query runs. The webhook contains a `ScheduledQueryRun` object, which you can use to retrieve the query results.\n\n## [Report Types](https://docs.stripe.com/api/reporting/report_type)\n\nThe Report Type resource corresponds to a particular type of report, such as the “Activity summary” or “Itemized payouts” reports. These objects are identified by an ID belonging to a set of enumerated values. See [API Access to Reports documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/reporting/statements/api) for those Report Type IDs, along with required and optional parameters.\n\nNote that certain report types can only be run based on your live-mode data (not test-mode data), and will error when queried without a [live-mode API key](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#test-live-modes).\n\n## [Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/financial_connections/sessions)\n\nA Financial Connections Session is the secure way to programmatically launch the client-side Stripe.js modal that lets your users link their accounts.\n\n## [Verification Report](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_reports)\n\nA VerificationReport is the result of an attempt to collect and verify data from a user. The collection of verification checks performed is determined from the `type` and `options` parameters used. You can find the result of each verification check performed in the appropriate sub-resource: `document`, `id_number`, `selfie`.\n\nEach VerificationReport contains a copy of any data collected by the user as well as reference IDs which can be used to access collected images through the [FileUpload](https://docs.stripe.com/api/files) API. To configure and create VerificationReports, use the [VerificationSession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_sessions) API.\n\nRelated guide: [Accessing verification results](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verification-sessions#results).\n\n## [Crypto Onramp Quotes](https://docs.stripe.com/api/crypto/onramp_quotes)\n\nCrypto Onramp Quotes are estimated quotes for onramp conversions into all the different cryptocurrencies on different networks. The Quotes API allows you to display quotes in your product UI before directing the user to the onramp widget.\n\nRelated guide: [Quotes API](https://docs.stripe.com/crypto/quotes-api)\n\n## [Climate Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/climate/product)\n\nA Climate product represents a type of carbon removal unit available for reservation. You can retrieve it to see the current price and availability.\n\n## [Forwarding Request](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/request)\n\nInstructs Stripe to make a request on your behalf using the destination URL. The destination URL is activated by Stripe at the time of onboarding. Stripe verifies requests with your credentials provided during onboarding, and injects card details from the payment\\_method into the request.\n\nStripe redacts all sensitive fields and headers, including authentication credentials and card numbers, before storing the request and response data in the forwarding Request object, which are subject to a 30-day retention period.\n\nYou can provide a Stripe idempotency key to make sure that requests with the same key result in only one outbound request. The Stripe idempotency key provided should be unique and different from any idempotency keys provided on the underlying third-party request.\n\nForwarding Requests are synchronous requests that return a response or time out according to Stripe’s limits.\n\nRelated guide: [Forward card details to third-party API endpoints](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/forwarding).\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/create)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/retrieve)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/list)",

By visiting the session’s URL, the customer can manage their subscriptions and billing details. For security reasons, sessions are short-lived and will expire if the customer does not visit the URL. Create sessions on-demand when customers intend to manage their subscriptions and billing details.\n\nRelated guide: [Customer management](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management)\n\n## [Invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices)\n\nInvoices are statements of amounts owed by a customer, and are either generated one-off, or generated periodically from a subscription.\n\nThey contain [invoice items](#invoiceitems), and proration adjustments that may be caused by subscription upgrades/downgrades (if necessary).\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed through automatic charges, Stripe automatically finalizes your invoice and attempts payment. Note that finalizing the invoice, [when automatic](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/automatic-advancement-collection), does not happen immediately as the invoice is created. Stripe waits until one hour after the last webhook was successfully sent (or the last webhook timed out after failing). If you (and the platforms you may have connected to) have no webhooks configured, Stripe waits one hour after creation to finalize the invoice.\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed by sending an email, then based on your [email settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/billing/automatic), Stripe will email the invoice to your customer and await payment. These emails can contain a link to a hosted page to pay the invoice.\n\nStripe applies any customer credit on the account before determining the amount due for the invoice (i.e., the amount that will be actually charged). If the amount due for the invoice is less than Stripe’s [minimum allowed charge per currency](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts), the invoice is automatically marked paid, and we add the amount due to the customer’s credit balance which is applied to the next invoice.\n\nMore details on the customer’s credit balance are [here](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/customer/balance).\n\nRelated guide: [Send invoices to customers](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/invoices/sending)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create)[POST/v1/invoices/create\\_preview](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create_preview)[POST/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/lines/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_line)[GET/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/retrieve)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming)[GET/v1/invoices/:id/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming_invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/list)[DELETE/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/delete)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/add\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/add_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/remove\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/remove_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/update\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/finalize](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/finalize)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/mark\\_uncollectible](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/mark_uncollectible)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/pay](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/pay)[GET/v1/invoices/search](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/search)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/send](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/send)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/void](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/void)\n\n## [Meter Events](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event)\n\nA billing meter event represents a customer’s usage of a product. Meter events are used to bill a customer based on their usage. Meter events are associated with billing meters, which define the shape of the event’s payload and how those events are aggregated for billing.\n\n## [Meter Event Adjustment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_adjustment)\n\nA billing meter event adjustment is a resource that allows you to cancel a meter event. For example, you might create a billing meter event adjustment to cancel a meter event that was created in error or attached to the wrong customer.\n\n## [Meter Event Summary](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_summary)\n\nA billing meter event summary represents an aggregated view of a customer’s billing meter events within a specified timeframe. It indicates how much usage was accrued by a customer for that period.\n\n## [Plans](https://docs.stripe.com/api/plans)\n\nYou can now model subscriptions more flexibly using the [Prices API](#prices). It replaces the Plans API and is backwards compatible to simplify your migration.\n\nPlans define the base price, currency, and billing cycle for recurring purchases of products. [Products](#products) help you track inventory or provisioning, and plans help you track pricing. Different physical goods or levels of service should be represented by products, and pricing options should be represented by plans. This approach lets you change prices without having to change your provisioning scheme.\n\nFor example, you might have a single “gold” product that has plans for $10/month, $100/year, €9/month, and €90/year.\n\nRelated guides: [Set up a subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/set-up-subscription) and more about [products and prices](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/overview).\n\n## [Tax IDs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_create)[POST/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/create)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_retrieve)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/retrieve)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_list)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/list)[DELETE/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_delete)[DELETE/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/delete)\n\n## [Account Links](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_links)\n\nAccount Links are the means by which a Connect platform grants a connected account permission to access Stripe-hosted applications, such as Connect Onboarding.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect Onboarding](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom/hosted-onboarding)\n\n## [Account Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_sessions)\n\nAn AccountSession allows a Connect platform to grant access to a connected account in Connect embedded components.\n\nWe recommend that you create an AccountSession each time you need to display an embedded component to your user. Do not save AccountSessions to your database as they expire relatively quickly, and cannot be used more than once.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect embedded components](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-connect-embedded-components)\n\n## [Application Fees](https://docs.stripe.com/api/application_fees)\n\nWhen you collect a transaction fee on top of a charge made for your user (using [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)), an `Application Fee` object is created in your account. You can list, retrieve, and refund application fees.\n\nRelated guide: [Collecting application fees](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges#collect-fees)\n\n## [Country Specs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/country_specs)\n\nStripe needs to collect certain pieces of information about each account created. These requirements can differ depending on the account’s country. The Country Specs API makes these rules available to your integration.\n\nYou can also view the information from this API call as [an online guide](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information).\n\n## [Person](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/create)[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/update)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/retrieve)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/list)[DELETE/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/delete)\n\n## [Transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/transfers)\n\nA `Transfer` object is created when you move funds between Stripe accounts as part of Connect.\n\nBefore April 6, 2017, transfers also represented movement of funds from a Stripe account to a card or bank account. This behavior has since been split out into a [Payout](#payout_object) object, with corresponding payout endpoints. For more information, read about the [transfer/payout split](https://docs.stripe.com/transfer-payout-split).\n\nRelated guide: [Creating separate charges and transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n\n## [Secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/secret_management)\n\nSecret Store is an API that allows Stripe Apps developers to securely persist secrets for use by UI Extensions and app backends.\n\nThe primary resource in Secret Store is a `secret`. Other apps can’t view secrets created by an app. Additionally, secrets are scoped to provide further permission control.\n\nAll Dashboard users and the app backend share `account` scoped secrets. Use the `account` scope for secrets that don’t change per-user, like a third-party API key.\n\nA `user` scoped secret is accessible by the app backend and one specific Dashboard user. Use the `user` scope for per-user secrets like per-user OAuth tokens, where different users might have different permissions.\n\nRelated guide: [Store data between page reloads](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/store-auth-data-custom-objects)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[GET/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/list)[POST/v1/apps/secrets/delete](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/delete)[GET/v1/apps/secrets/find](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/find)[POST/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/set)\n\n## [Reviews](https://docs.stripe.com/api/radar/reviews)\n\nReviews can be used to supplement automated fraud detection with human expertise.\n\nLearn more about [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar) and reviewing payments [here](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/reviews).\n\n## [Authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/update)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/list)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/approve](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/approve)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/decline](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/decline)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_create)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/capture](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_capture)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/expire](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_expire)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/finalize\\_amount](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_finalize_amount)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/increment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_increment)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/fraud\\_challenges/respond](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/respond_to_fraud_challenges)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/reverse](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_reverse)\n\n## [Cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/create)[POST/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/update)[GET/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/list)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/deliver](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_deliver)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/fail](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_fail)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/return](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_return)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/ship](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_ship)\n\n## [Physical Bundles](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/physical_bundles)\n\nA Physical Bundle represents the bundle of physical items - card stock, carrier letter, and envelope - that is shipped to a cardholder when you create a physical card.\n\n## [Reader](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/terminal/readers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/create)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/update)[GET/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/retrieve)[GET/v1/terminal/readers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/list)[DELETE/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/delete)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/cancel\\_action](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/cancel_action)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/collect\\_inputs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/collect_inputs)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/confirm\\_payment\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/confirm_payment_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/collect\\_payment\\_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/collect_payment_method)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/process\\_payment\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/process_payment_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/process\\_setup\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/process_setup_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/refund\\_payment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/refund_payment)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/set\\_reader\\_display](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/set_reader_display)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/terminal/readers/:id/present\\_payment\\_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/present_payment_method)\n\n## [Terminal Hardware Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_products)Preview feature\n\nA TerminalHardwareProduct is a category of hardware devices that are generally similar, but may have variations depending on the country it’s shipped to.\n\nTerminalHardwareSKUs represent variations within the same Product (for example, a country specific device). For example, WisePOS E is a TerminalHardwareProduct and a WisePOS E - US and WisePOS E - UK are TerminalHardwareSKUs.\n\n## [Terminal Hardware SKU](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_skus)Preview feature\n\nA TerminalHardwareSKU represents a SKU for Terminal hardware. A SKU is a representation of a product available for purchase, containing information such as the name, price, and images.\n\n## [Transaction Entries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/transaction_entries)\n\nTransactionEntries represent individual units of money movements within a single [Transaction](#transactions).\n\n## [Scheduled Queries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/sigma/scheduled_queries)\n\nIf you have [scheduled a Sigma query](https://docs.stripe.com/sigma/scheduled-queries), you’ll receive a `sigma.scheduled_query_run.created` webhook each time the query runs. The webhook contains a `ScheduledQueryRun` object, which you can use to retrieve the query results.\n\n## [Report Types](https://docs.stripe.com/api/reporting/report_type)\n\nThe Report Type resource corresponds to a particular type of report, such as the “Activity summary” or “Itemized payouts” reports. These objects are identified by an ID belonging to a set of enumerated values. See [API Access to Reports documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/reporting/statements/api) for those Report Type IDs, along with required and optional parameters.\n\nNote that certain report types can only be run based on your live-mode data (not test-mode data), and will error when queried without a [live-mode API key](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#test-live-modes).\n\n## [Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/financial_connections/sessions)\n\nA Financial Connections Session is the secure way to programmatically launch the client-side Stripe.js modal that lets your users link their accounts.\n\n## [Verification Report](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_reports)\n\nA VerificationReport is the result of an attempt to collect and verify data from a user. The collection of verification checks performed is determined from the `type` and `options` parameters used. You can find the result of each verification check performed in the appropriate sub-resource: `document`, `id_number`, `selfie`.\n\nEach VerificationReport contains a copy of any data collected by the user as well as reference IDs which can be used to access collected images through the [FileUpload](https://docs.stripe.com/api/files) API. To configure and create VerificationReports, use the [VerificationSession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_sessions) API.\n\nRelated guide: [Accessing verification results](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verification-sessions#results).\n\n## [Crypto Onramp Quotes](https://docs.stripe.com/api/crypto/onramp_quotes)\n\nCrypto Onramp Quotes are estimated quotes for onramp conversions into all the different cryptocurrencies on different networks. The Quotes API allows you to display quotes in your product UI before directing the user to the onramp widget.\n\nRelated guide: [Quotes API](https://docs.stripe.com/crypto/quotes-api)\n\n## [Climate Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/climate/product)\n\nA Climate product represents a type of carbon removal unit available for reservation. You can retrieve it to see the current price and availability.\n\n## [Forwarding Request](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/request)\n\nInstructs Stripe to make a request on your behalf using the destination URL. The destination URL is activated by Stripe at the time of onboarding. Stripe verifies requests with your credentials provided during onboarding, and injects card details from the payment\\_method into the request.\n\nStripe redacts all sensitive fields and headers, including authentication credentials and card numbers, before storing the request and response data in the forwarding Request object, which are subject to a 30-day retention period.\n\nYou can provide a Stripe idempotency key to make sure that requests with the same key result in only one outbound request. The Stripe idempotency key provided should be unique and different from any idempotency keys provided on the underlying third-party request.\n\nForwarding Requests are synchronous requests that return a response or time out according to Stripe’s limits.\n\nRelated guide: [Forward card details to third-party API endpoints](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/forwarding).\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/create)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/retrieve)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/list)",

By visiting the session’s URL, the customer can manage their subscriptions and billing details. For security reasons, sessions are short-lived and will expire if the customer does not visit the URL. Create sessions on-demand when customers intend to manage their subscriptions and billing details.\n\nRelated guide: [Customer management](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management)\n\n## [Invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices)\n\nInvoices are statements of amounts owed by a customer, and are either generated one-off, or generated periodically from a subscription.\n\nThey contain [invoice items](#invoiceitems), and proration adjustments that may be caused by subscription upgrades/downgrades (if necessary).\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed through automatic charges, Stripe automatically finalizes your invoice and attempts payment. Note that finalizing the invoice, [when automatic](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/automatic-advancement-collection), does not happen immediately as the invoice is created. Stripe waits until one hour after the last webhook was successfully sent (or the last webhook timed out after failing). If you (and the platforms you may have connected to) have no webhooks configured, Stripe waits one hour after creation to finalize the invoice.\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed by sending an email, then based on your [email settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/billing/automatic), Stripe will email the invoice to your customer and await payment. These emails can contain a link to a hosted page to pay the invoice.\n\nStripe applies any customer credit on the account before determining the amount due for the invoice (i.e., the amount that will be actually charged). If the amount due for the invoice is less than Stripe’s [minimum allowed charge per currency](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts), the invoice is automatically marked paid, and we add the amount due to the customer’s credit balance which is applied to the next invoice.\n\nMore details on the customer’s credit balance are [here](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/customer/balance).\n\nRelated guide: [Send invoices to customers](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/invoices/sending)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create)[POST/v1/invoices/create\\_preview](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create_preview)[POST/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/lines/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_line)[GET/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/retrieve)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming)[GET/v1/invoices/:id/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming_invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/list)[DELETE/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/delete)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/add\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/add_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/remove\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/remove_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/update\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/finalize](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/finalize)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/mark\\_uncollectible](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/mark_uncollectible)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/pay](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/pay)[GET/v1/invoices/search](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/search)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/send](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/send)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/void](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/void)\n\n## [Meter Events](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event)\n\nA billing meter event represents a customer’s usage of a product. Meter events are used to bill a customer based on their usage. Meter events are associated with billing meters, which define the shape of the event’s payload and how those events are aggregated for billing.\n\n## [Meter Event Adjustment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_adjustment)\n\nA billing meter event adjustment is a resource that allows you to cancel a meter event. For example, you might create a billing meter event adjustment to cancel a meter event that was created in error or attached to the wrong customer.\n\n## [Meter Event Summary](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_summary)\n\nA billing meter event summary represents an aggregated view of a customer’s billing meter events within a specified timeframe. It indicates how much usage was accrued by a customer for that period.\n\n## [Plans](https://docs.stripe.com/api/plans)\n\nYou can now model subscriptions more flexibly using the [Prices API](#prices). It replaces the Plans API and is backwards compatible to simplify your migration.\n\nPlans define the base price, currency, and billing cycle for recurring purchases of products. [Products](#products) help you track inventory or provisioning, and plans help you track pricing. Different physical goods or levels of service should be represented by products, and pricing options should be represented by plans. This approach lets you change prices without having to change your provisioning scheme.\n\nFor example, you might have a single “gold” product that has plans for $10/month, $100/year, €9/month, and €90/year.\n\nRelated guides: [Set up a subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/set-up-subscription) and more about [products and prices](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/overview).\n\n## [Tax IDs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_create)[POST/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/create)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_retrieve)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/retrieve)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_list)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/list)[DELETE/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_delete)[DELETE/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/delete)\n\n## [Account Links](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_links)\n\nAccount Links are the means by which a Connect platform grants a connected account permission to access Stripe-hosted applications, such as Connect Onboarding.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect Onboarding](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom/hosted-onboarding)\n\n## [Account Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_sessions)\n\nAn AccountSession allows a Connect platform to grant access to a connected account in Connect embedded components.\n\nWe recommend that you create an AccountSession each time you need to display an embedded component to your user. Do not save AccountSessions to your database as they expire relatively quickly, and cannot be used more than once.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect embedded components](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-connect-embedded-components)\n\n## [Application Fees](https://docs.stripe.com/api/application_fees)\n\nWhen you collect a transaction fee on top of a charge made for your user (using [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)), an `Application Fee` object is created in your account. You can list, retrieve, and refund application fees.\n\nRelated guide: [Collecting application fees](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges#collect-fees)\n\n## [Country Specs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/country_specs)\n\nStripe needs to collect certain pieces of information about each account created. These requirements can differ depending on the account’s country. The Country Specs API makes these rules available to your integration.\n\nYou can also view the information from this API call as [an online guide](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information).\n\n## [Person](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/create)[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/update)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/retrieve)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/list)[DELETE/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/delete)\n\n## [Transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/transfers)\n\nA `Transfer` object is created when you move funds between Stripe accounts as part of Connect.\n\nBefore April 6, 2017, transfers also represented movement of funds from a Stripe account to a card or bank account. This behavior has since been split out into a [Payout](#payout_object) object, with corresponding payout endpoints. For more information, read about the [transfer/payout split](https://docs.stripe.com/transfer-payout-split).\n\nRelated guide: [Creating separate charges and transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n\n## [Secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/secret_management)\n\nSecret Store is an API that allows Stripe Apps developers to securely persist secrets for use by UI Extensions and app backends.\n\nThe primary resource in Secret Store is a `secret`. Other apps can’t view secrets created by an app. Additionally, secrets are scoped to provide further permission control.\n\nAll Dashboard users and the app backend share `account` scoped secrets. Use the `account` scope for secrets that don’t change per-user, like a third-party API key.\n\nA `user` scoped secret is accessible by the app backend and one specific Dashboard user. Use the `user` scope for per-user secrets like per-user OAuth tokens, where different users might have different permissions.\n\nRelated guide: [Store data between page reloads](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/store-auth-data-custom-objects)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[GET/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/list)[POST/v1/apps/secrets/delete](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/delete)[GET/v1/apps/secrets/find](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/find)[POST/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/set)\n\n## [Reviews](https://docs.stripe.com/api/radar/reviews)\n\nReviews can be used to supplement automated fraud detection with human expertise.\n\nLearn more about [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar) and reviewing payments [here](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/reviews).\n\n## [Authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/update)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/list)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/approve](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/approve)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/decline](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/decline)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_create)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/capture](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_capture)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/expire](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_expire)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/finalize\\_amount](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_finalize_amount)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/increment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_increment)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/fraud\\_challenges/respond](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/respond_to_fraud_challenges)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/reverse](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_reverse)\n\n## [Cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/create)[POST/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/update)[GET/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/list)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/deliver](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_deliver)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/fail](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_fail)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/return](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_return)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/ship](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_ship)\n\n## [Physical Bundles](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/physical_bundles)\n\nA Physical Bundle represents the bundle of physical items - card stock, carrier letter, and envelope - that is shipped to a cardholder when you create a physical card.\n\n## [Reader](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/terminal/readers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/create)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/update)[GET/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/retrieve)[GET/v1/terminal/readers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/list)[DELETE/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/delete)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/cancel\\_action](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/cancel_action)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/collect\\_inputs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/collect_inputs)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/confirm\\_payment\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/confirm_payment_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/collect\\_payment\\_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/collect_payment_method)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/process\\_payment\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/process_payment_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/process\\_setup\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/process_setup_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/refund\\_payment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/refund_payment)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/set\\_reader\\_display](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/set_reader_display)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/terminal/readers/:id/present\\_payment\\_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/present_payment_method)\n\n## [Terminal Hardware Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_products)Preview feature\n\nA TerminalHardwareProduct is a category of hardware devices that are generally similar, but may have variations depending on the country it’s shipped to.\n\nTerminalHardwareSKUs represent variations within the same Product (for example, a country specific device). For example, WisePOS E is a TerminalHardwareProduct and a WisePOS E - US and WisePOS E - UK are TerminalHardwareSKUs.\n\n## [Terminal Hardware SKU](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_skus)Preview feature\n\nA TerminalHardwareSKU represents a SKU for Terminal hardware. A SKU is a representation of a product available for purchase, containing information such as the name, price, and images.\n\n## [Transaction Entries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/transaction_entries)\n\nTransactionEntries represent individual units of money movements within a single [Transaction](#transactions).\n\n## [Scheduled Queries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/sigma/scheduled_queries)\n\nIf you have [scheduled a Sigma query](https://docs.stripe.com/sigma/scheduled-queries), you’ll receive a `sigma.scheduled_query_run.created` webhook each time the query runs. The webhook contains a `ScheduledQueryRun` object, which you can use to retrieve the query results.\n\n## [Report Types](https://docs.stripe.com/api/reporting/report_type)\n\nThe Report Type resource corresponds to a particular type of report, such as the “Activity summary” or “Itemized payouts” reports. These objects are identified by an ID belonging to a set of enumerated values. See [API Access to Reports documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/reporting/statements/api) for those Report Type IDs, along with required and optional parameters.\n\nNote that certain report types can only be run based on your live-mode data (not test-mode data), and will error when queried without a [live-mode API key](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#test-live-modes).\n\n## [Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/financial_connections/sessions)\n\nA Financial Connections Session is the secure way to programmatically launch the client-side Stripe.js modal that lets your users link their accounts.\n\n## [Verification Report](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_reports)\n\nA VerificationReport is the result of an attempt to collect and verify data from a user. The collection of verification checks performed is determined from the `type` and `options` parameters used. You can find the result of each verification check performed in the appropriate sub-resource: `document`, `id_number`, `selfie`.\n\nEach VerificationReport contains a copy of any data collected by the user as well as reference IDs which can be used to access collected images through the [FileUpload](https://docs.stripe.com/api/files) API. To configure and create VerificationReports, use the [VerificationSession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_sessions) API.\n\nRelated guide: [Accessing verification results](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verification-sessions#results).\n\n## [Crypto Onramp Quotes](https://docs.stripe.com/api/crypto/onramp_quotes)\n\nCrypto Onramp Quotes are estimated quotes for onramp conversions into all the different cryptocurrencies on different networks. The Quotes API allows you to display quotes in your product UI before directing the user to the onramp widget.\n\nRelated guide: [Quotes API](https://docs.stripe.com/crypto/quotes-api)\n\n## [Climate Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/climate/product)\n\nA Climate product represents a type of carbon removal unit available for reservation. You can retrieve it to see the current price and availability.\n\n## [Forwarding Request](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/request)\n\nInstructs Stripe to make a request on your behalf using the destination URL. The destination URL is activated by Stripe at the time of onboarding. Stripe verifies requests with your credentials provided during onboarding, and injects card details from the payment\\_method into the request.\n\nStripe redacts all sensitive fields and headers, including authentication credentials and card numbers, before storing the request and response data in the forwarding Request object, which are subject to a 30-day retention period.\n\nYou can provide a Stripe idempotency key to make sure that requests with the same key result in only one outbound request. The Stripe idempotency key provided should be unique and different from any idempotency keys provided on the underlying third-party request.\n\nForwarding Requests are synchronous requests that return a response or time out according to Stripe’s limits.\n\nRelated guide: [Forward card details to third-party API endpoints](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/forwarding).\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/create)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/retrieve)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/list)",

You can use SetupAttempts to inspect details of a specific attempt at setting up a payment method using a SetupIntent.\n\n## [Confirmation Token](https://docs.stripe.com/api/confirmation_tokens)\n\nConfirmationTokens help transport client side data collected by Stripe JS over to your server for confirming a PaymentIntent or SetupIntent. If the confirmation is successful, values present on the ConfirmationToken are written onto the Intent.\n\nTo learn more about how to use ConfirmationToken, visit the related guides:\n\n*   [Finalize payments on the server](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/finalize-payments-on-the-server)\n*   [Build two-step confirmation](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/build-a-two-step-confirmation).\n\n## [Tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens)\n\nTokenization is the process Stripe uses to collect sensitive card or bank account details, or personally identifiable information (PII), directly from your customers in a secure manner. A token representing this information is returned to your server to use. Use our [recommended payments integrations](https://docs.stripe.com/payments) to perform this process on the client-side. This guarantees that no sensitive card data touches your server, and allows your integration to operate in a PCI-compliant way.\n\nIf you can’t use client-side tokenization, you can also create tokens using the API with either your publishable or secret API key. If your integration uses this method, you’re responsible for any PCI compliance that it might require, and you must keep your secret API key safe. Unlike with client-side tokenization, your customer’s information isn’t sent directly to Stripe, so we can’t determine how it’s handled or stored.\n\nYou can’t store or use tokens more than once. To store card or bank account information for later use, create [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api#customers) objects or [External accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/api#external_accounts). [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar), our integrated solution for automatic fraud protection, performs best with integrations that use client-side tokenization.\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_account)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_bank_account)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_card)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_cvc_update)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_person)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_pii)[GET/v1/tokens/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/retrieve)\n\n## [Cash Balance](https://docs.stripe.com/api/cash_balance)\n\nA customer’s `Cash balance` represents real funds. Customers can add funds to their cash balance by sending a bank transfer. These funds can be used for payment and can eventually be paid out to your bank account.\n\n## [Customer Portal Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customer_portal/sessions)\n\nThe Billing customer portal is a Stripe-hosted UI for subscription and billing management.\n\nA portal configuration describes the functionality and features that you want to provide to your customers through the portal.\n\nA portal session describes the instantiation of the customer portal for a particular customer. By visiting the session’s URL, the customer can manage their subscriptions and billing details. For security reasons, sessions are short-lived and will expire if the customer does not visit the URL. Create sessions on-demand when customers intend to manage their subscriptions and billing details.\n\nRelated guide: [Customer management](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management)\n\n## [Invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices)\n\nInvoices are statements of amounts owed by a customer, and are either generated one-off, or generated periodically from a subscription.\n\nThey contain [invoice items](#invoiceitems), and proration adjustments that may be caused by subscription upgrades/downgrades (if necessary).\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed through automatic charges, Stripe automatically finalizes your invoice and attempts payment. Note that finalizing the invoice, [when automatic](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/automatic-advancement-collection), does not happen immediately as the invoice is created. Stripe waits until one hour after the last webhook was successfully sent (or the last webhook timed out after failing). If you (and the platforms you may have connected to) have no webhooks configured, Stripe waits one hour after creation to finalize the invoice.\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed by sending an email, then based on your [email settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/billing/automatic), Stripe will email the invoice to your customer and await payment. These emails can contain a link to a hosted page to pay the invoice.\n\nStripe applies any customer credit on the account before determining the amount due for the invoice (i.e., the amount that will be actually charged). If the amount due for the invoice is less than Stripe’s [minimum allowed charge per currency](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts), the invoice is automatically marked paid, and we add the amount due to the customer’s credit balance which is applied to the next invoice.\n\nMore details on the customer’s credit balance are [here](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/customer/balance).\n\nRelated guide: [Send invoices to customers](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/invoices/sending)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create)[POST/v1/invoices/create\\_preview](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create_preview)[POST/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/lines/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_line)[GET/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/retrieve)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming)[GET/v1/invoices/:id/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming_invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/list)[DELETE/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/delete)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/add\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/add_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/remove\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/remove_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/update\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/finalize](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/finalize)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/mark\\_uncollectible](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/mark_uncollectible)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/pay](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/pay)[GET/v1/invoices/search](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/search)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/send](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/send)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/void](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/void)\n\n## [Meter Events](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event)\n\nA billing meter event represents a customer’s usage of a product. Meter events are used to bill a customer based on their usage. Meter events are associated with billing meters, which define the shape of the event’s payload and how those events are aggregated for billing.\n\n## [Meter Event Adjustment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_adjustment)\n\nA billing meter event adjustment is a resource that allows you to cancel a meter event. For example, you might create a billing meter event adjustment to cancel a meter event that was created in error or attached to the wrong customer.\n\n## [Meter Event Summary](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_summary)\n\nA billing meter event summary represents an aggregated view of a customer’s billing meter events within a specified timeframe. It indicates how much usage was accrued by a customer for that period.\n\n## [Plans](https://docs.stripe.com/api/plans)\n\nYou can now model subscriptions more flexibly using the [Prices API](#prices). It replaces the Plans API and is backwards compatible to simplify your migration.\n\nPlans define the base price, currency, and billing cycle for recurring purchases of products. [Products](#products) help you track inventory or provisioning, and plans help you track pricing. Different physical goods or levels of service should be represented by products, and pricing options should be represented by plans. This approach lets you change prices without having to change your provisioning scheme.\n\nFor example, you might have a single “gold” product that has plans for $10/month, $100/year, €9/month, and €90/year.\n\nRelated guides: [Set up a subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/set-up-subscription) and more about [products and prices](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/overview).\n\n## [Tax IDs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_create)[POST/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/create)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_retrieve)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/retrieve)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_list)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/list)[DELETE/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_delete)[DELETE/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/delete)\n\n## [Account Links](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_links)\n\nAccount Links are the means by which a Connect platform grants a connected account permission to access Stripe-hosted applications, such as Connect Onboarding.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect Onboarding](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom/hosted-onboarding)\n\n## [Account Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_sessions)\n\nAn AccountSession allows a Connect platform to grant access to a connected account in Connect embedded components.\n\nWe recommend that you create an AccountSession each time you need to display an embedded component to your user. Do not save AccountSessions to your database as they expire relatively quickly, and cannot be used more than once.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect embedded components](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-connect-embedded-components)\n\n## [Application Fees](https://docs.stripe.com/api/application_fees)\n\nWhen you collect a transaction fee on top of a charge made for your user (using [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)), an `Application Fee` object is created in your account. You can list, retrieve, and refund application fees.\n\nRelated guide: [Collecting application fees](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges#collect-fees)\n\n## [Country Specs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/country_specs)\n\nStripe needs to collect certain pieces of information about each account created. These requirements can differ depending on the account’s country. The Country Specs API makes these rules available to your integration.\n\nYou can also view the information from this API call as [an online guide](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information).\n\n## [Person](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/create)[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/update)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/retrieve)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/list)[DELETE/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/delete)\n\n## [Transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/transfers)\n\nA `Transfer` object is created when you move funds between Stripe accounts as part of Connect.\n\nBefore April 6, 2017, transfers also represented movement of funds from a Stripe account to a card or bank account. This behavior has since been split out into a [Payout](#payout_object) object, with corresponding payout endpoints. For more information, read about the [transfer/payout split](https://docs.stripe.com/transfer-payout-split).\n\nRelated guide: [Creating separate charges and transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n\n## [Secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/secret_management)\n\nSecret Store is an API that allows Stripe Apps developers to securely persist secrets for use by UI Extensions and app backends.\n\nThe primary resource in Secret Store is a `secret`. Other apps can’t view secrets created by an app. Additionally, secrets are scoped to provide further permission control.\n\nAll Dashboard users and the app backend share `account` scoped secrets. Use the `account` scope for secrets that don’t change per-user, like a third-party API key.\n\nA `user` scoped secret is accessible by the app backend and one specific Dashboard user. Use the `user` scope for per-user secrets like per-user OAuth tokens, where different users might have different permissions.\n\nRelated guide: [Store data between page reloads](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/store-auth-data-custom-objects)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[GET/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/list)[POST/v1/apps/secrets/delete](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/delete)[GET/v1/apps/secrets/find](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/find)[POST/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/set)\n\n## [Reviews](https://docs.stripe.com/api/radar/reviews)\n\nReviews can be used to supplement automated fraud detection with human expertise.\n\nLearn more about [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar) and reviewing payments [here](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/reviews).\n\n## [Authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/update)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/list)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/approve](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/approve)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/decline](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/decline)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_create)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/capture](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_capture)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/expire](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_expire)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/finalize\\_amount](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_finalize_amount)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/increment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_increment)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/fraud\\_challenges/respond](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/respond_to_fraud_challenges)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/reverse](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_reverse)\n\n## [Cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/create)[POST/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/update)[GET/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/list)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/deliver](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_deliver)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/fail](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_fail)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/return](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_return)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/ship](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_ship)\n\n## [Physical Bundles](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/physical_bundles)\n\nA Physical Bundle represents the bundle of physical items - card stock, carrier letter, and envelope - that is shipped to a cardholder when you create a physical card.\n\n## [Reader](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/terminal/readers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/create)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/update)[GET/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/retrieve)[GET/v1/terminal/readers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/list)[DELETE/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/delete)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/cancel\\_action](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/cancel_action)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/collect\\_inputs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/collect_inputs)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/confirm\\_payment\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/confirm_payment_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/collect\\_payment\\_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/collect_payment_method)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/process\\_payment\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/process_payment_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/process\\_setup\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/process_setup_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/refund\\_payment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/refund_payment)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/set\\_reader\\_display](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/set_reader_display)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/terminal/readers/:id/present\\_payment\\_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/present_payment_method)\n\n## [Terminal Hardware Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_products)Preview feature\n\nA TerminalHardwareProduct is a category of hardware devices that are generally similar, but may have variations depending on the country it’s shipped to.\n\nTerminalHardwareSKUs represent variations within the same Product (for example, a country specific device). For example, WisePOS E is a TerminalHardwareProduct and a WisePOS E - US and WisePOS E - UK are TerminalHardwareSKUs.\n\n## [Terminal Hardware SKU](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_skus)Preview feature\n\nA TerminalHardwareSKU represents a SKU for Terminal hardware. A SKU is a representation of a product available for purchase, containing information such as the name, price, and images.\n\n## [Transaction Entries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/transaction_entries)\n\nTransactionEntries represent individual units of money movements within a single [Transaction](#transactions).\n\n## [Scheduled Queries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/sigma/scheduled_queries)\n\nIf you have [scheduled a Sigma query](https://docs.stripe.com/sigma/scheduled-queries), you’ll receive a `sigma.scheduled_query_run.created` webhook each time the query runs. The webhook contains a `ScheduledQueryRun` object, which you can use to retrieve the query results.\n\n## [Report Types](https://docs.stripe.com/api/reporting/report_type)\n\nThe Report Type resource corresponds to a particular type of report, such as the “Activity summary” or “Itemized payouts” reports. These objects are identified by an ID belonging to a set of enumerated values. See [API Access to Reports documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/reporting/statements/api) for those Report Type IDs, along with required and optional parameters.\n\nNote that certain report types can only be run based on your live-mode data (not test-mode data), and will error when queried without a [live-mode API key](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#test-live-modes).\n\n## [Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/financial_connections/sessions)\n\nA Financial Connections Session is the secure way to programmatically launch the client-side Stripe.js modal that lets your users link their accounts.\n\n## [Verification Report](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_reports)\n\nA VerificationReport is the result of an attempt to collect and verify data from a user. The collection of verification checks performed is determined from the `type` and `options` parameters used. You can find the result of each verification check performed in the appropriate sub-resource: `document`, `id_number`, `selfie`.\n\nEach VerificationReport contains a copy of any data collected by the user as well as reference IDs which can be used to access collected images through the [FileUpload](https://docs.stripe.com/api/files) API. To configure and create VerificationReports, use the [VerificationSession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_sessions) API.\n\nRelated guide: [Accessing verification results](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verification-sessions#results).\n\n## [Crypto Onramp Quotes](https://docs.stripe.com/api/crypto/onramp_quotes)\n\nCrypto Onramp Quotes are estimated quotes for onramp conversions into all the different cryptocurrencies on different networks. The Quotes API allows you to display quotes in your product UI before directing the user to the onramp widget.\n\nRelated guide: [Quotes API](https://docs.stripe.com/crypto/quotes-api)\n\n## [Climate Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/climate/product)\n\nA Climate product represents a type of carbon removal unit available for reservation. You can retrieve it to see the current price and availability.\n\n## [Forwarding Request](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/request)\n\nInstructs Stripe to make a request on your behalf using the destination URL. The destination URL is activated by Stripe at the time of onboarding. Stripe verifies requests with your credentials provided during onboarding, and injects card details from the payment\\_method into the request.\n\nStripe redacts all sensitive fields and headers, including authentication credentials and card numbers, before storing the request and response data in the forwarding Request object, which are subject to a 30-day retention period.\n\nYou can provide a Stripe idempotency key to make sure that requests with the same key result in only one outbound request. The Stripe idempotency key provided should be unique and different from any idempotency keys provided on the underlying third-party request.\n\nForwarding Requests are synchronous requests that return a response or time out according to Stripe’s limits.\n\nRelated guide: [Forward card details to third-party API endpoints](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/forwarding).\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/create)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/retrieve)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/list)",

By visiting the session’s URL, the customer can manage their subscriptions and billing details. For security reasons, sessions are short-lived and will expire if the customer does not visit the URL. Create sessions on-demand when customers intend to manage their subscriptions and billing details.\n\nRelated guide: [Customer management](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management)\n\n## [Invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices)\n\nInvoices are statements of amounts owed by a customer, and are either generated one-off, or generated periodically from a subscription.\n\nThey contain [invoice items](#invoiceitems), and proration adjustments that may be caused by subscription upgrades/downgrades (if necessary).\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed through automatic charges, Stripe automatically finalizes your invoice and attempts payment. Note that finalizing the invoice, [when automatic](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/automatic-advancement-collection), does not happen immediately as the invoice is created. Stripe waits until one hour after the last webhook was successfully sent (or the last webhook timed out after failing). If you (and the platforms you may have connected to) have no webhooks configured, Stripe waits one hour after creation to finalize the invoice.\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed by sending an email, then based on your [email settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/billing/automatic), Stripe will email the invoice to your customer and await payment. These emails can contain a link to a hosted page to pay the invoice.\n\nStripe applies any customer credit on the account before determining the amount due for the invoice (i.e., the amount that will be actually charged). If the amount due for the invoice is less than Stripe’s [minimum allowed charge per currency](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts), the invoice is automatically marked paid, and we add the amount due to the customer’s credit balance which is applied to the next invoice.\n\nMore details on the customer’s credit balance are [here](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/customer/balance).\n\nRelated guide: [Send invoices to customers](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/invoices/sending)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create)[POST/v1/invoices/create\\_preview](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create_preview)[POST/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/lines/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_line)[GET/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/retrieve)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming)[GET/v1/invoices/:id/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming_invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/list)[DELETE/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/delete)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/add\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/add_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/remove\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/remove_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/update\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/finalize](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/finalize)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/mark\\_uncollectible](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/mark_uncollectible)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/pay](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/pay)[GET/v1/invoices/search](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/search)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/send](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/send)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/void](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/void)\n\n## [Meter Events](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event)\n\nA billing meter event represents a customer’s usage of a product. Meter events are used to bill a customer based on their usage. Meter events are associated with billing meters, which define the shape of the event’s payload and how those events are aggregated for billing.\n\n## [Meter Event Adjustment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_adjustment)\n\nA billing meter event adjustment is a resource that allows you to cancel a meter event. For example, you might create a billing meter event adjustment to cancel a meter event that was created in error or attached to the wrong customer.\n\n## [Meter Event Summary](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_summary)\n\nA billing meter event summary represents an aggregated view of a customer’s billing meter events within a specified timeframe. It indicates how much usage was accrued by a customer for that period.\n\n## [Plans](https://docs.stripe.com/api/plans)\n\nYou can now model subscriptions more flexibly using the [Prices API](#prices). It replaces the Plans API and is backwards compatible to simplify your migration.\n\nPlans define the base price, currency, and billing cycle for recurring purchases of products. [Products](#products) help you track inventory or provisioning, and plans help you track pricing. Different physical goods or levels of service should be represented by products, and pricing options should be represented by plans. This approach lets you change prices without having to change your provisioning scheme.\n\nFor example, you might have a single “gold” product that has plans for $10/month, $100/year, €9/month, and €90/year.\n\nRelated guides: [Set up a subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/set-up-subscription) and more about [products and prices](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/overview).\n\n## [Tax IDs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_create)[POST/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/create)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_retrieve)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/retrieve)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_list)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/list)[DELETE/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_delete)[DELETE/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/delete)\n\n## [Account Links](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_links)\n\nAccount Links are the means by which a Connect platform grants a connected account permission to access Stripe-hosted applications, such as Connect Onboarding.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect Onboarding](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom/hosted-onboarding)\n\n## [Account Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_sessions)\n\nAn AccountSession allows a Connect platform to grant access to a connected account in Connect embedded components.\n\nWe recommend that you create an AccountSession each time you need to display an embedded component to your user.

If the confirmation is successful, values present on the ConfirmationToken are written onto the Intent.\n\nTo learn more about how to use ConfirmationToken, visit the related guides:\n\n*   [Finalize payments on the server](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/finalize-payments-on-the-server)\n*   [Build two-step confirmation](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/build-a-two-step-confirmation).\n\n## [Tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens)\n\nTokenization is the process Stripe uses to collect sensitive card or bank account details, or personally identifiable information (PII), directly from your customers in a secure manner. A token representing this information is returned to your server to use. Use our [recommended payments integrations](https://docs.stripe.com/payments) to perform this process on the client-side. This guarantees that no sensitive card data touches your server, and allows your integration to operate in a PCI-compliant way.\n\nIf you can’t use client-side tokenization, you can also create tokens using the API with either your publishable or secret API key. If your integration uses this method, you’re responsible for any PCI compliance that it might require, and you must keep your secret API key safe. Unlike with client-side tokenization, your customer’s information isn’t sent directly to Stripe, so we can’t determine how it’s handled or stored.\n\nYou can’t store or use tokens more than once. To store card or bank account information for later use, create [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api#customers) objects or [External accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/api#external_accounts). [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar), our integrated solution for automatic fraud protection, performs best with integrations that use client-side tokenization.\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_account)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_bank_account)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_card)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_cvc_update)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_person)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_pii)[GET/v1/tokens/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/retrieve)\n\n## [Cash Balance](https://docs.stripe.com/api/cash_balance)\n\nA customer’s `Cash balance` represents real funds. Customers can add funds to their cash balance by sending a bank transfer. These funds can be used for payment and can eventually be paid out to your bank account.\n\n## [Customer Portal Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customer_portal/sessions)\n\nThe Billing customer portal is a Stripe-hosted UI for subscription and billing management.\n\nA portal configuration describes the functionality and features that you want to provide to your customers through the portal.\n\nA portal session describes the instantiation of the customer portal for a particular customer. By visiting the session’s URL, the customer can manage their subscriptions and billing details. For security reasons, sessions are short-lived and will expire if the customer does not visit the URL. Create sessions on-demand when customers intend to manage their subscriptions and billing details.\n\nRelated guide: [Customer management](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management)\n\n## [Invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices)\n\nInvoices are statements of amounts owed by a customer, and are either generated one-off, or generated periodically from a subscription.\n\nThey contain [invoice items](#invoiceitems), and proration adjustments that may be caused by subscription upgrades/downgrades (if necessary).\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed through automatic charges, Stripe automatically finalizes your invoice and attempts payment. Note that finalizing the invoice, [when automatic](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/automatic-advancement-collection), does not happen immediately as the invoice is created. Stripe waits until one hour after the last webhook was successfully sent (or the last webhook timed out after failing). If you (and the platforms you may have connected to) have no webhooks configured, Stripe waits one hour after creation to finalize the invoice.\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed by sending an email, then based on your [email settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/billing/automatic), Stripe will email the invoice to your customer and await payment. These emails can contain a link to a hosted page to pay the invoice.\n\nStripe applies any customer credit on the account before determining the amount due for the invoice (i.e., the amount that will be actually charged). If the amount due for the invoice is less than Stripe’s [minimum allowed charge per currency](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts), the invoice is automatically marked paid, and we add the amount due to the customer’s credit balance which is applied to the next invoice.\n\nMore details on the customer’s credit balance are [here](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/customer/balance).\n\nRelated guide: [Send invoices to customers](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/invoices/sending)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create)[POST/v1/invoices/create\\_preview](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create_preview)[POST/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/lines/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_line)[GET/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/retrieve)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming)[GET/v1/invoices/:id/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming_invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/list)[DELETE/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/delete)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/add\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/add_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/remove\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/remove_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/update\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/finalize](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/finalize)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/mark\\_uncollectible](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/mark_uncollectible)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/pay](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/pay)[GET/v1/invoices/search](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/search)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/send](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/send)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/void](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/void)\n\n## [Meter Events](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event)\n\nA billing meter event represents a customer’s usage of a product. Meter events are used to bill a customer based on their usage. Meter events are associated with billing meters, which define the shape of the event’s payload and how those events are aggregated for billing.\n\n## [Meter Event Adjustment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_adjustment)\n\nA billing meter event adjustment is a resource that allows you to cancel a meter event. For example, you might create a billing meter event adjustment to cancel a meter event that was created in error or attached to the wrong customer.\n\n## [Meter Event Summary](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_summary)\n\nA billing meter event summary represents an aggregated view of a customer’s billing meter events within a specified timeframe. It indicates how much usage was accrued by a customer for that period.\n\n## [Plans](https://docs.stripe.com/api/plans)\n\nYou can now model subscriptions more flexibly using the [Prices API](#prices). It replaces the Plans API and is backwards compatible to simplify your migration.\n\nPlans define the base price, currency, and billing cycle for recurring purchases of products. [Products](#products) help you track inventory or provisioning, and plans help you track pricing. Different physical goods or levels of service should be represented by products, and pricing options should be represented by plans. This approach lets you change prices without having to change your provisioning scheme.\n\nFor example, you might have a single “gold” product that has plans for $10/month, $100/year, €9/month, and €90/year.\n\nRelated guides: [Set up a subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/set-up-subscription) and more about [products and prices](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/overview).\n\n## [Tax IDs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_create)[POST/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/create)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_retrieve)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/retrieve)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_list)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/list)[DELETE/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_delete)[DELETE/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/delete)\n\n## [Account Links](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_links)\n\nAccount Links are the means by which a Connect platform grants a connected account permission to access Stripe-hosted applications, such as Connect Onboarding.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect Onboarding](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom/hosted-onboarding)\n\n## [Account Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_sessions)\n\nAn AccountSession allows a Connect platform to grant access to a connected account in Connect embedded components.\n\nWe recommend that you create an AccountSession each time you need to display an embedded component to your user. Do not save AccountSessions to your database as they expire relatively quickly, and cannot be used more than once.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect embedded components](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-connect-embedded-components)\n\n## [Application Fees](https://docs.stripe.com/api/application_fees)\n\nWhen you collect a transaction fee on top of a charge made for your user (using [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)), an `Application Fee` object is created in your account. You can list, retrieve, and refund application fees.\n\nRelated guide: [Collecting application fees](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges#collect-fees)\n\n## [Country Specs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/country_specs)\n\nStripe needs to collect certain pieces of information about each account created. These requirements can differ depending on the account’s country. The Country Specs API makes these rules available to your integration.\n\nYou can also view the information from this API call as [an online guide](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information).\n\n## [Person](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/create)[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/update)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/retrieve)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/list)[DELETE/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/delete)\n\n## [Transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/transfers)\n\nA `Transfer` object is created when you move funds between Stripe accounts as part of Connect.\n\nBefore April 6, 2017, transfers also represented movement of funds from a Stripe account to a card or bank account. This behavior has since been split out into a [Payout](#payout_object) object, with corresponding payout endpoints. For more information, read about the [transfer/payout split](https://docs.stripe.com/transfer-payout-split).\n\nRelated guide: [Creating separate charges and transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n\n## [Secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/secret_management)\n\nSecret Store is an API that allows Stripe Apps developers to securely persist secrets for use by UI Extensions and app backends.\n\nThe primary resource in Secret Store is a `secret`. Other apps can’t view secrets created by an app. Additionally, secrets are scoped to provide further permission control.\n\nAll Dashboard users and the app backend share `account` scoped secrets. Use the `account` scope for secrets that don’t change per-user, like a third-party API key.\n\nA `user` scoped secret is accessible by the app backend and one specific Dashboard user. Use the `user` scope for per-user secrets like per-user OAuth tokens, where different users might have different permissions.\n\nRelated guide: [Store data between page reloads](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/store-auth-data-custom-objects)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[GET/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/list)[POST/v1/apps/secrets/delete](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/delete)[GET/v1/apps/secrets/find](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/find)[POST/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/set)\n\n## [Reviews](https://docs.stripe.com/api/radar/reviews)\n\nReviews can be used to supplement automated fraud detection with human expertise.\n\nLearn more about [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar) and reviewing payments [here](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/reviews).\n\n## [Authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/update)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/list)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/approve](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/approve)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/decline](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/decline)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_create)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/capture](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_capture)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/expire](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_expire)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/finalize\\_amount](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_finalize_amount)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/increment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_increment)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/fraud\\_challenges/respond](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/respond_to_fraud_challenges)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/reverse](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_reverse)\n\n## [Cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/create)[POST/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/update)[GET/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/list)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/deliver](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_deliver)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/fail](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_fail)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/return](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_return)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/ship](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_ship)\n\n## [Physical Bundles](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/physical_bundles)\n\nA Physical Bundle represents the bundle of physical items - card stock, carrier letter, and envelope - that is shipped to a cardholder when you create a physical card.\n\n## [Reader](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/terminal/readers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/create)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/update)[GET/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/retrieve)[GET/v1/terminal/readers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/list)[DELETE/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/delete)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/cancel\\_action](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/cancel_action)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/collect\\_inputs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/collect_inputs)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/confirm\\_payment\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/confirm_payment_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/collect\\_payment\\_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/collect_payment_method)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/process\\_payment\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/process_payment_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/process\\_setup\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/process_setup_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/refund\\_payment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/refund_payment)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/set\\_reader\\_display](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/set_reader_display)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/terminal/readers/:id/present\\_payment\\_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/present_payment_method)\n\n## [Terminal Hardware Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_products)Preview feature\n\nA TerminalHardwareProduct is a category of hardware devices that are generally similar, but may have variations depending on the country it’s shipped to.\n\nTerminalHardwareSKUs represent variations within the same Product (for example, a country specific device). For example, WisePOS E is a TerminalHardwareProduct and a WisePOS E - US and WisePOS E - UK are TerminalHardwareSKUs.\n\n## [Terminal Hardware SKU](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_skus)Preview feature\n\nA TerminalHardwareSKU represents a SKU for Terminal hardware. A SKU is a representation of a product available for purchase, containing information such as the name, price, and images.\n\n## [Transaction Entries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/transaction_entries)\n\nTransactionEntries represent individual units of money movements within a single [Transaction](#transactions).\n\n## [Scheduled Queries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/sigma/scheduled_queries)\n\nIf you have [scheduled a Sigma query](https://docs.stripe.com/sigma/scheduled-queries), you’ll receive a `sigma.scheduled_query_run.created` webhook each time the query runs. The webhook contains a `ScheduledQueryRun` object, which you can use to retrieve the query results.\n\n## [Report Types](https://docs.stripe.com/api/reporting/report_type)\n\nThe Report Type resource corresponds to a particular type of report, such as the “Activity summary” or “Itemized payouts” reports. These objects are identified by an ID belonging to a set of enumerated values. See [API Access to Reports documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/reporting/statements/api) for those Report Type IDs, along with required and optional parameters.\n\nNote that certain report types can only be run based on your live-mode data (not test-mode data), and will error when queried without a [live-mode API key](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#test-live-modes).\n\n## [Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/financial_connections/sessions)\n\nA Financial Connections Session is the secure way to programmatically launch the client-side Stripe.js modal that lets your users link their accounts.\n\n## [Verification Report](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_reports)\n\nA VerificationReport is the result of an attempt to collect and verify data from a user. The collection of verification checks performed is determined from the `type` and `options` parameters used. You can find the result of each verification check performed in the appropriate sub-resource: `document`, `id_number`, `selfie`.\n\nEach VerificationReport contains a copy of any data collected by the user as well as reference IDs which can be used to access collected images through the [FileUpload](https://docs.stripe.com/api/files) API. To configure and create VerificationReports, use the [VerificationSession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_sessions) API.\n\nRelated guide: [Accessing verification results](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verification-sessions#results).\n\n## [Crypto Onramp Quotes](https://docs.stripe.com/api/crypto/onramp_quotes)\n\nCrypto Onramp Quotes are estimated quotes for onramp conversions into all the different cryptocurrencies on different networks. The Quotes API allows you to display quotes in your product UI before directing the user to the onramp widget.\n\nRelated guide: [Quotes API](https://docs.stripe.com/crypto/quotes-api)\n\n## [Climate Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/climate/product)\n\nA Climate product represents a type of carbon removal unit available for reservation. You can retrieve it to see the current price and availability.\n\n## [Forwarding Request](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/request)\n\nInstructs Stripe to make a request on your behalf using the destination URL. The destination URL is activated by Stripe at the time of onboarding. Stripe verifies requests with your credentials provided during onboarding, and injects card details from the payment\\_method into the request.\n\nStripe redacts all sensitive fields and headers, including authentication credentials and card numbers, before storing the request and response data in the forwarding Request object, which are subject to a 30-day retention period.\n\nYou can provide a Stripe idempotency key to make sure that requests with the same key result in only one outbound request. The Stripe idempotency key provided should be unique and different from any idempotency keys provided on the underlying third-party request.\n\nForwarding Requests are synchronous requests that return a response or time out according to Stripe’s limits.\n\nRelated guide: [Forward card details to third-party API endpoints](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/forwarding).\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/create)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/retrieve)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/list)",

    "markdown": "# Card payments with Sources | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Card payments with SourcesDeprecated\n\n## Use Sources to accept card payments from around the world.\n\n#### Warning\n\nStripe users can process card payments from customers around the world using [Sources](https://docs.stripe.com/sources)—a single integration path for creating payments using any supported method. During the payment process, your integration creates a source representing the card information. This source is then used in a charge request to debit the card and complete the payment.\n\nWithin the scope of Sources, cards are a [pull](https://docs.stripe.com/sources#pull-or-push-of-funds)\\-based, [reusable](https://docs.stripe.com/sources#single-use-or-reusable) and [synchronous](https://docs.stripe.com/sources#synchronous-or-asynchronous-confirmation) method of payment. This means that, after capturing the customer’s card details, you can debit arbitrary amounts from the customer’s card without them having to take any additional action and there is immediate confirmation about the success or failure of a payment.\n\n## Handling card information![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nCard information is sensitive by nature. Card sources must be created client-side using [Stripe.js and Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/elements). This ensures that no sensitive card data passes through your server so your integration can operate in a [PCI compliant](https://stripe.com/guides/pci-compliance) way.\n\nWhen your customer submits their card information using your payment form, it is sent directly to Stripe, and a representative [Source](https://docs.stripe.com/api#sources) object is returned for you to use. The process is similar to the creation of [tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens). If you’re already using Elements to tokenize card information, switching to Sources is only a small change.\n\n[](#considerations)\n\nCard payments with Sources has fewer steps and requirements than other payment methods. As it’s a synchronous method and there is no additional customer action to take, the use of [webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks \"webhook\") isn’t necessary. If you only want to accept card payments, you can simply follow the steps within this documentation to begin accepting cards with Sources.\n\nHowever, accepting other methods of payment through Sources (for example, [iDEAL](https://docs.stripe.com/sources/ideal), [SEPA Direct Debit](https://docs.stripe.com/sources/sepa-debit), and so on) requires additional steps, making the use of webhooks necessary. You can refer to our [best practices](https://docs.stripe.com/sources/best-practices) for developing a flexible checkout flow that supports different payment methods.\n\n[](#create-source)\n\nTo create a card Source client-side, please refer to [Accept a payment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment-charges#web-create-token). You then create a `Source` object instead of a Token by calling the `createSource` instead of the `createToken` method.\n\nYou can also provide an optional [owner](https://docs.stripe.com/api#create_source-owner) dictionary containing additional cardholder information, such as their name and full billing address.\n\n`// Create a source or display an error when the form is submitted. const form = document.getElementById('payment-form'); const ownerInfo = {   owner: {     name: 'Jenny Rosen',     address: {       line1: 'Nollendorfstraße 27',       city: 'Berlin',       postal_code: '10777',       country: 'DE',     },     email: 'jenny.rosen@example.com'   }, }; form.addEventListener('submit', async (event) => {   event.preventDefault();    const {source, error} = await stripe.createSource(card, ownerInfo);    if (error) {     // Inform the user if there was an error     const errorElement = document.getElementById('card-errors');     errorElement.textContent = error.message;   } else {     // Send the source to your server     stripeSourceHandler(source);   } });`\n\nIf your Elements payment form collects a billing postal code, it’s used as the value for the `owner` field `address[postal_code]` during source creation. This also overrides any value that is being provided separately as part of `owner`. If you are already collecting your customer’s billing postal code elsewhere on your checkout page, we recommend including it as part of `owner` and hiding the Elements postal code field—set the [Element option](https://docs.stripe.com/js/elements_object/create_element?type=card#elements_create-options-hidePostalCode) of `hidePostalCode` to **true**.\n\nThe last steps of the [Accept a payment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment-charges#web-submit-payment) guide remain similar and consist of submitting the source, along with any additional information that has been collected, to your server.\n\n`const stripeSourceHandler = (source) => {   // Insert the source ID into the form so it gets submitted to the server   const form = document.getElementById('payment-form');   const hiddenInput = document.createElement('input');   hiddenInput.setAttribute('type', 'hidden');   hiddenInput.setAttribute('name', 'stripeSource');   hiddenInput.setAttribute('value', source.id);   form.appendChild(hiddenInput);    // Submit the form   form.submit(); }`\n\nWhen the source is created, its status immediately changes to `chargeable`. No additional customer action is needed so the source can be used right away. Information about the card is provided within the [card](https://docs.stripe.com/api#cards) subhash.\n\n`{   \"id\": \"src_1AhIN74iJb0CbkEwmbRYPsd4\",   \"object\": \"source\",   \"amount\": null,   \"client_secret\": \"src_client_secret_sSPHZ17iQG6j9uKFdAYqPErO\",   \"created\": 1500471469,   \"currency\": null,   \"flow\": \"none\",   \"livemode\": false,   \"metadata\": {`\n\nAs card payments are a pull-based payment method, there is no movement of funds during the creation of a source. Only when a successful charge request has been made is the customer’s card debited and you receive the funds.\n\n### Source creation in mobile applications![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nIf you’re building an iOS or Android app, you can implement sources using our mobile SDKs. Refer to our sources documentation for [iOS](https://docs.stripe.com/mobile/ios/sources) or [Android](https://docs.stripe.com/mobile/android/sources) to learn more.\n\n[](#charge-request)\n\nAfter creating a card Source, and before creating a charge request to complete the payment, attach it to a [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api#customers) for later reuse.\n\n### Attaching the Source to a Customer![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nAttaching the Source to a [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers \"Customers\") is required for you to reuse it for future payments. Please refer to our [Sources & Customers](https://docs.stripe.com/sources/customers) guide for more details on how to attach Sources to new or existing Customers and how the two objects interact together. The following snippet attaches the Source to a new Customer:\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/customers \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\   --data-urlencode email=\"paying.user@example.com\" \\  -d source=src_18eYalAHEMiOZZp1l9ZTjSU0`\n\n### Making a charge request to finalize the payment![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nOnce attached, you can use the `Source` object’s ID along with the `Customer` object’s ID to perform a charge request and finalize the payment.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/charges \\   -u` \n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`: \\   -d amount=\"1000\" \\   -d currency=\"usd\" \\   -d customer=cus_AFGbOSiITuJVDs \\   -d source=src_18eYalAHEMiOZZp1l9ZTjSU0`\n\nA card source must be used within a few minutes of its creation as CVC information is only available for a short amount of time. Card sources do not expire, but using them after a delay can result in a charge request that is performed without CVC information. The consequences of this can be higher decline rates and increased risk of fraud.\n\nAlthough the status of the source is `chargeable`, this does not mean that the payment is going to be successful. A charge request can still fail if the customer’s card issuer [declines](https://docs.stripe.com/declines) the payment.\n\n[](#charge-confirmation)\n\nCard payments are a [synchronous](https://docs.stripe.com/sources#synchronous-or-asynchronous-confirmation) method so confirmation of the charge’s status happens in real-time.\n\nYour integration immediately receives the result of the charge request—either a [Charge](https://docs.stripe.com/api#charges) object upon success or an exception upon failure. Once the charge has been confirmed as successful, the payment has been successfully completed and you can notify your customer and fulfill the order.\n\nIf you’re making use of [webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks), your integration also receives either of the following events:\n\n| Event | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `charge.succeeded` | The charge succeeded and the payment is complete. |\n| `charge.failed` | The charge has failed and the payment could not be completed. |\n\n### Disputed payments![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nCard networks provide a process for cardholders to [dispute](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes) payments made with their card. A dispute can be filed by the cardholder any time after a payment has been successful. It is still possible for a successful payment to be reversed if the card issuer investigates a dispute and decides it should be refunded.\n\nDisputes can be made for a variety of reasons. As such, you should make the appropriate decisions regarding your business and how you manage disputes, if they occur, and how to avoid them completely.\n\n### Updating a card source expiration date![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYou can update the `card[exp_month]` and `card[exp_year]` attributes of card sources, allowing you to update their expiration date:\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/sources/src_18cPLvAHEMiOZZp1YBngt6En \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d currency=usd \\  -d \"card[exp_month]\"=11 \\  -d \"card[exp_year]\"=2022`\n\n## See also![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n*   [Declines & failed payments](https://docs.stripe.com/declines)\n*   [Other supported payment methods](https://docs.stripe.com/sources)\n*   [Sources API reference](https://docs.stripe.com/api#sources)\n*   [Best practices](https://docs.stripe.com/sources/best-practices)",

You can use SetupAttempts to inspect details of a specific attempt at setting up a payment method using a SetupIntent.\n\n## [Confirmation Token](https://docs.stripe.com/api/confirmation_tokens)\n\nConfirmationTokens help transport client side data collected by Stripe JS over to your server for confirming a PaymentIntent or SetupIntent. If the confirmation is successful, values present on the ConfirmationToken are written onto the Intent.\n\nTo learn more about how to use ConfirmationToken, visit the related guides:\n\n*   [Finalize payments on the server](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/finalize-payments-on-the-server)\n*   [Build two-step confirmation](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/build-a-two-step-confirmation).\n\n## [Tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens)\n\nTokenization is the process Stripe uses to collect sensitive card or bank account details, or personally identifiable information (PII), directly from your customers in a secure manner. A token representing this information is returned to your server to use. Use our [recommended payments integrations](https://docs.stripe.com/payments) to perform this process on the client-side. This guarantees that no sensitive card data touches your server, and allows your integration to operate in a PCI-compliant way.\n\nIf you can’t use client-side tokenization, you can also create tokens using the API with either your publishable or secret API key. If your integration uses this method, you’re responsible for any PCI compliance that it might require, and you must keep your secret API key safe. Unlike with client-side tokenization, your customer’s information isn’t sent directly to Stripe, so we can’t determine how it’s handled or stored.\n\nYou can’t store or use tokens more than once. To store card or bank account information for later use, create [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api#customers) objects or [External accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/api#external_accounts). [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar), our integrated solution for automatic fraud protection, performs best with integrations that use client-side tokenization.\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_account)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_bank_account)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_card)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_cvc_update)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_person)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_pii)[GET/v1/tokens/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/retrieve)\n\n## [Cash Balance](https://docs.stripe.com/api/cash_balance)\n\nA customer’s `Cash balance` represents real funds. Customers can add funds to their cash balance by sending a bank transfer. These funds can be used for payment and can eventually be paid out to your bank account.\n\n## [Customer Portal Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customer_portal/sessions)\n\nThe Billing customer portal is a Stripe-hosted UI for subscription and billing management.\n\nA portal configuration describes the functionality and features that you want to provide to your customers through the portal.\n\nA portal session describes the instantiation of the customer portal for a particular customer. By visiting the session’s URL, the customer can manage their subscriptions and billing details. For security reasons, sessions are short-lived and will expire if the customer does not visit the URL. Create sessions on-demand when customers intend to manage their subscriptions and billing details.\n\nRelated guide: [Customer management](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management)\n\n## [Invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices)\n\nInvoices are statements of amounts owed by a customer, and are either generated one-off, or generated periodically from a subscription.\n\nThey contain [invoice items](#invoiceitems), and proration adjustments that may be caused by subscription upgrades/downgrades (if necessary).\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed through automatic charges, Stripe automatically finalizes your invoice and attempts payment. Note that finalizing the invoice, [when automatic](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/automatic-advancement-collection), does not happen immediately as the invoice is created. Stripe waits until one hour after the last webhook was successfully sent (or the last webhook timed out after failing). If you (and the platforms you may have connected to) have no webhooks configured, Stripe waits one hour after creation to finalize the invoice.\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed by sending an email, then based on your [email settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/billing/automatic), Stripe will email the invoice to your customer and await payment. These emails can contain a link to a hosted page to pay the invoice.\n\nStripe applies any customer credit on the account before determining the amount due for the invoice (i.e., the amount that will be actually charged). If the amount due for the invoice is less than Stripe’s [minimum allowed charge per currency](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts), the invoice is automatically marked paid, and we add the amount due to the customer’s credit balance which is applied to the next invoice.\n\nMore details on the customer’s credit balance are [here](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/customer/balance).\n\nRelated guide: [Send invoices to customers](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/invoices/sending)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create)[POST/v1/invoices/create\\_preview](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create_preview)[POST/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/lines/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_line)[GET/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/retrieve)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming)[GET/v1/invoices/:id/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming_invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/list)[DELETE/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/delete)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/add\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/add_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/remove\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/remove_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/update\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/finalize](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/finalize)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/mark\\_uncollectible](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/mark_uncollectible)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/pay](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/pay)[GET/v1/invoices/search](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/search)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/send](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/send)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/void](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/void)\n\n## [Meter Events](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event)\n\nA billing meter event represents a customer’s usage of a product. Meter events are used to bill a customer based on their usage. Meter events are associated with billing meters, which define the shape of the event’s payload and how those events are aggregated for billing.\n\n## [Meter Event Adjustment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_adjustment)\n\nA billing meter event adjustment is a resource that allows you to cancel a meter event. For example, you might create a billing meter event adjustment to cancel a meter event that was created in error or attached to the wrong customer.\n\n## [Meter Event Summary](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_summary)\n\nA billing meter event summary represents an aggregated view of a customer’s billing meter events within a specified timeframe. It indicates how much usage was accrued by a customer for that period.\n\n## [Plans](https://docs.stripe.com/api/plans)\n\nYou can now model subscriptions more flexibly using the [Prices API](#prices). It replaces the Plans API and is backwards compatible to simplify your migration.\n\nPlans define the base price, currency, and billing cycle for recurring purchases of products. [Products](#products) help you track inventory or provisioning, and plans help you track pricing. Different physical goods or levels of service should be represented by products, and pricing options should be represented by plans. This approach lets you change prices without having to change your provisioning scheme.\n\nFor example, you might have a single “gold” product that has plans for $10/month, $100/year, €9/month, and €90/year.\n\nRelated guides: [Set up a subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/set-up-subscription) and more about [products and prices](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/overview).\n\n## [Tax IDs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_create)[POST/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/create)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_retrieve)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/retrieve)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_list)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/list)[DELETE/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_delete)[DELETE/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/delete)\n\n## [Account Links](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_links)\n\nAccount Links are the means by which a Connect platform grants a connected account permission to access Stripe-hosted applications, such as Connect Onboarding.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect Onboarding](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom/hosted-onboarding)\n\n## [Account Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_sessions)\n\nAn AccountSession allows a Connect platform to grant access to a connected account in Connect embedded components.\n\nWe recommend that you create an AccountSession each time you need to display an embedded component to your user. Do not save AccountSessions to your database as they expire relatively quickly, and cannot be used more than once.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect embedded components](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-connect-embedded-components)\n\n## [Application Fees](https://docs.stripe.com/api/application_fees)\n\nWhen you collect a transaction fee on top of a charge made for your user (using [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)), an `Application Fee` object is created in your account. You can list, retrieve, and refund application fees.\n\nRelated guide: [Collecting application fees](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges#collect-fees)\n\n## [Country Specs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/country_specs)\n\nStripe needs to collect certain pieces of information about each account created. These requirements can differ depending on the account’s country. The Country Specs API makes these rules available to your integration.\n\nYou can also view the information from this API call as [an online guide](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information).\n\n## [Person](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/create)[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/update)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/retrieve)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/list)[DELETE/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/delete)\n\n## [Transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/transfers)\n\nA `Transfer` object is created when you move funds between Stripe accounts as part of Connect.\n\nBefore April 6, 2017, transfers also represented movement of funds from a Stripe account to a card or bank account. This behavior has since been split out into a [Payout](#payout_object) object, with corresponding payout endpoints. For more information, read about the [transfer/payout split](https://docs.stripe.com/transfer-payout-split).\n\nRelated guide: [Creating separate charges and transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n\n## [Secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/secret_management)\n\nSecret Store is an API that allows Stripe Apps developers to securely persist secrets for use by UI Extensions and app backends.\n\nThe primary resource in Secret Store is a `secret`. Other apps can’t view secrets created by an app. Additionally, secrets are scoped to provide further permission control.\n\nAll Dashboard users and the app backend share `account` scoped secrets. Use the `account` scope for secrets that don’t change per-user, like a third-party API key.\n\nA `user` scoped secret is accessible by the app backend and one specific Dashboard user. Use the `user` scope for per-user secrets like per-user OAuth tokens, where different users might have different permissions.\n\nRelated guide: [Store data between page reloads](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/store-auth-data-custom-objects)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[GET/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/list)[POST/v1/apps/secrets/delete](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/delete)[GET/v1/apps/secrets/find](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/find)[POST/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/set)\n\n## [Reviews](https://docs.stripe.com/api/radar/reviews)\n\nReviews can be used to supplement automated fraud detection with human expertise.\n\nLearn more about [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar) and reviewing payments [here](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/reviews).\n\n## [Authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/update)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/list)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/approve](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/approve)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/decline](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/decline)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_create)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/capture](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_capture)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/expire](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_expire)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/finalize\\_amount](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_finalize_amount)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/increment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_increment)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/fraud\\_challenges/respond](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/respond_to_fraud_challenges)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/reverse](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_reverse)\n\n## [Cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/create)[POST/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/update)[GET/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/list)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/deliver](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_deliver)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/fail](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_fail)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/return](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_return)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/ship](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_ship)\n\n## [Physical Bundles](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/physical_bundles)\n\nA Physical Bundle represents the bundle of physical items -

For example, WisePOS E is a TerminalHardwareProduct and a WisePOS E - US and WisePOS E - UK are TerminalHardwareSKUs.\n\n## [Terminal Hardware SKU](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_skus)Preview feature\n\nA TerminalHardwareSKU represents a SKU for Terminal hardware. A SKU is a representation of a product available for purchase, containing information such as the name, price, and images.\n\n## [Transaction Entries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/transaction_entries)\n\nTransactionEntries represent individual units of money movements within a single [Transaction](#transactions).\n\n## [Scheduled Queries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/sigma/scheduled_queries)\n\nIf you have [scheduled a Sigma query](https://docs.stripe.com/sigma/scheduled-queries), you’ll receive a `sigma.scheduled_query_run.created` webhook each time the query runs. The webhook contains a `ScheduledQueryRun` object, which you can use to retrieve the query results.\n\n## [Report Types](https://docs.stripe.com/api/reporting/report_type)\n\nThe Report Type resource corresponds to a particular type of report, such as the “Activity summary” or “Itemized payouts” reports. These objects are identified by an ID belonging to a set of enumerated values. See [API Access to Reports documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/reporting/statements/api) for those Report Type IDs, along with required and optional parameters.\n\nNote that certain report types can only be run based on your live-mode data (not test-mode data), and will error when queried without a [live-mode API key](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#test-live-modes).\n\n## [Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/financial_connections/sessions)\n\nA Financial Connections Session is the secure way to programmatically launch the client-side Stripe.js modal that lets your users link their accounts.\n\n## [Verification Report](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_reports)\n\nA VerificationReport is the result of an attempt to collect and verify data from a user. The collection of verification checks performed is determined from the `type` and `options` parameters used. You can find the result of each verification check performed in the appropriate sub-resource: `document`, `id_number`, `selfie`.\n\nEach VerificationReport contains a copy of any data collected by the user as well as reference IDs which can be used to access collected images through the [FileUpload](https://docs.stripe.com/api/files) API. To configure and create VerificationReports, use the [VerificationSession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_sessions) API.\n\nRelated guide: [Accessing verification results](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verification-sessions#results).\n\n## [Crypto Onramp Quotes](https://docs.stripe.com/api/crypto/onramp_quotes)\n\nCrypto Onramp Quotes are estimated quotes for onramp conversions into all the different cryptocurrencies on different networks. The Quotes API allows you to display quotes in your product UI before directing the user to the onramp widget.\n\nRelated guide: [Quotes API](https://docs.stripe.com/crypto/quotes-api)\n\n## [Climate Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/climate/product)\n\nA Climate product represents a type of carbon removal unit available for reservation. You can retrieve it to see the current price and availability.\n\n## [Forwarding Request](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/request)\n\nInstructs Stripe to make a request on your behalf using the destination URL. The destination URL is activated by Stripe at the time of onboarding. Stripe verifies requests with your credentials provided during onboarding, and injects card details from the payment\\_method into the request.\n\nStripe redacts all sensitive fields and headers, including authentication credentials and card numbers, before storing the request and response data in the forwarding Request object, which are subject to a 30-day retention period.\n\nYou can provide a Stripe idempotency key to make sure that requests with the same key result in only one outbound request. The Stripe idempotency key provided should be unique and different from any idempotency keys provided on the underlying third-party request.\n\nForwarding Requests are synchronous requests that return a response or time out according to Stripe’s limits.\n\nRelated guide: [Forward card details to third-party API endpoints](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/forwarding).\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/create)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/retrieve)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/list)",

You can use SetupAttempts to inspect details of a specific attempt at setting up a payment method using a SetupIntent.\n\n## [Confirmation Token](https://docs.stripe.com/api/confirmation_tokens)\n\nConfirmationTokens help transport client side data collected by Stripe JS over to your server for confirming a PaymentIntent or SetupIntent. If the confirmation is successful, values present on the ConfirmationToken are written onto the Intent.\n\nTo learn more about how to use ConfirmationToken, visit the related guides:\n\n*   [Finalize payments on the server](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/finalize-payments-on-the-server)\n*   [Build two-step confirmation](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/build-a-two-step-confirmation).\n\n## [Tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens)\n\nTokenization is the process Stripe uses to collect sensitive card or bank account details, or personally identifiable information (PII), directly from your customers in a secure manner. A token representing this information is returned to your server to use. Use our [recommended payments integrations](https://docs.stripe.com/payments) to perform this process on the client-side. This guarantees that no sensitive card data touches your server, and allows your integration to operate in a PCI-compliant way.\n\nIf you can’t use client-side tokenization, you can also create tokens using the API with either your publishable or secret API key. If your integration uses this method, you’re responsible for any PCI compliance that it might require, and you must keep your secret API key safe. Unlike with client-side tokenization, your customer’s information isn’t sent directly to Stripe, so we can’t determine how it’s handled or stored.\n\nYou can’t store or use tokens more than once. To store card or bank account information for later use, create [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api#customers) objects or [External accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/api#external_accounts). [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar), our integrated solution for automatic fraud protection, performs best with integrations that use client-side tokenization.\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_account)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_bank_account)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_card)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_cvc_update)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_person)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_pii)[GET/v1/tokens/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/retrieve)\n\n## [Cash Balance](https://docs.stripe.com/api/cash_balance)\n\nA customer’s `Cash balance` represents real funds. Customers can add funds to their cash balance by sending a bank transfer. These funds can be used for payment and can eventually be paid out to your bank account.\n\n## [Customer Portal Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customer_portal/sessions)\n\nThe Billing customer portal is a Stripe-hosted UI for subscription and billing management.\n\nA portal configuration describes the functionality and features that you want to provide to your customers through the portal.\n\nA portal session describes the instantiation of the customer portal for a particular customer. By visiting the session’s URL, the customer can manage their subscriptions and billing details. For security reasons, sessions are short-lived and will expire if the customer does not visit the URL. Create sessions on-demand when customers intend to manage their subscriptions and billing details.\n\nRelated guide: [Customer management](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management)\n\n## [Invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices)\n\nInvoices are statements of amounts owed by a customer, and are either generated one-off, or generated periodically from a subscription.\n\nThey contain [invoice items](#invoiceitems), and proration adjustments that may be caused by subscription upgrades/downgrades (if necessary).\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed through automatic charges, Stripe automatically finalizes your invoice and attempts payment. Note that finalizing the invoice, [when automatic](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/automatic-advancement-collection), does not happen immediately as the invoice is created. Stripe waits until one hour after the last webhook was successfully sent (or the last webhook timed out after failing). If you (and the platforms you may have connected to) have no webhooks configured, Stripe waits one hour after creation to finalize the invoice.\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed by sending an email, then based on your [email settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/billing/automatic), Stripe will email the invoice to your customer and await payment. These emails can contain a link to a hosted page to pay the invoice.\n\nStripe applies any customer credit on the account before determining the amount due for the invoice (i.e., the amount that will be actually charged). If the amount due for the invoice is less than Stripe’s [minimum allowed charge per currency](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts), the invoice is automatically marked paid, and we add the amount due to the customer’s credit balance which is applied to the next invoice.\n\nMore details on the customer’s credit balance are [here](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/customer/balance).\n\nRelated guide: [Send invoices to customers](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/invoices/sending)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create)[POST/v1/invoices/create\\_preview](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create_preview)[POST/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/lines/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_line)[GET/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/retrieve)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming)[GET/v1/invoices/:id/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming_invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/list)[DELETE/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/delete)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/add\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/add_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/remove\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/remove_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/update\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/finalize](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/finalize)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/mark\\_uncollectible](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/mark_uncollectible)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/pay](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/pay)[GET/v1/invoices/search](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/search)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/send](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/send)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/void](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/void)\n\n## [Meter Events](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event)\n\nA billing meter event represents a customer’s usage of a product.

Meter events are associated with billing meters, which define the shape of the event’s payload and how those events are aggregated for billing.\n\n## [Meter Event Adjustment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_adjustment)\n\nA billing meter event adjustment is a resource that allows you to cancel a meter event. For example, you might create a billing meter event adjustment to cancel a meter event that was created in error or attached to the wrong customer.\n\n## [Meter Event Summary](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_summary)\n\nA billing meter event summary represents an aggregated view of a customer’s billing meter events within a specified timeframe. It indicates how much usage was accrued by a customer for that period.\n\n## [Plans](https://docs.stripe.com/api/plans)\n\nYou can now model subscriptions more flexibly using the [Prices API](#prices). It replaces the Plans API and is backwards compatible to simplify your migration.\n\nPlans define the base price, currency, and billing cycle for recurring purchases of products. [Products](#products) help you track inventory or provisioning, and plans help you track pricing. Different physical goods or levels of service should be represented by products, and pricing options should be represented by plans. This approach lets you change prices without having to change your provisioning scheme.\n\nFor example, you might have a single “gold” product that has plans for $10/month, $100/year, €9/month, and €90/year.\n\nRelated guides: [Set up a subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/set-up-subscription) and more about [products and prices](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/overview).\n\n## [Tax IDs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_create)[POST/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/create)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_retrieve)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/retrieve)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_list)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/list)[DELETE/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_delete)[DELETE/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/delete)\n\n## [Account Links](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_links)\n\nAccount Links are the means by which a Connect platform grants a connected account permission to access Stripe-hosted applications, such as Connect Onboarding.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect Onboarding](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom/hosted-onboarding)\n\n## [Account Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_sessions)\n\nAn AccountSession allows a Connect platform to grant access to a connected account in Connect embedded components.\n\nWe recommend that you create an AccountSession each time you need to display an embedded component to your user. Do not save AccountSessions to your database as they expire relatively quickly, and cannot be used more than once.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect embedded components](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-connect-embedded-components)\n\n## [Application Fees](https://docs.stripe.com/api/application_fees)\n\nWhen you collect a transaction fee on top of a charge made for your user (using [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)), an `Application Fee` object is created in your account. You can list, retrieve, and refund application fees.\n\nRelated guide: [Collecting application fees](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges#collect-fees)\n\n## [Country Specs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/country_specs)\n\nStripe needs to collect certain pieces of information about each account created. These requirements can differ depending on the account’s country. The Country Specs API makes these rules available to your integration.\n\nYou can also view the information from this API call as [an online guide](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information).\n\n## [Person](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/create)[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/update)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/retrieve)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/list)[DELETE/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/delete)\n\n## [Transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/transfers)\n\nA `Transfer` object is created when you move funds between Stripe accounts as part of Connect.\n\nBefore April 6, 2017, transfers also represented movement of funds from a Stripe account to a card or bank account. This behavior has since been split out into a [Payout](#payout_object) object, with corresponding payout endpoints. For more information, read about the [transfer/payout split](https://docs.stripe.com/transfer-payout-split).\n\nRelated guide: [Creating separate charges and transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n\n## [Secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/secret_management)\n\nSecret Store is an API that allows Stripe Apps developers to securely persist secrets for use by UI Extensions and app backends.\n\nThe primary resource in Secret Store is a `secret`. Other apps can’t view secrets created by an app. Additionally, secrets are scoped to provide further permission control.\n\nAll Dashboard users and the app backend share `account` scoped secrets. Use the `account` scope for secrets that don’t change per-user, like a third-party API key.\n\nA `user` scoped secret is accessible by the app backend and one specific Dashboard user. Use the `user` scope for per-user secrets like per-user OAuth tokens, where different users might have different permissions.\n\nRelated guide: [Store data between page reloads](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/store-auth-data-custom-objects)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[GET/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/list)[POST/v1/apps/secrets/delete](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/delete)[GET/v1/apps/secrets/find](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/find)[POST/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/set)\n\n## [Reviews](https://docs.stripe.com/api/radar/reviews)\n\nReviews can be used to supplement automated fraud detection with human expertise.\n\nLearn more about [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar) and reviewing payments [here](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/reviews).\n\n## [Authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/update)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/list)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/approve](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/approve)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/decline](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/decline)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_create)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/capture](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_capture)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/expire](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_expire)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/finalize\\_amount](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_finalize_amount)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/increment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_increment)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/fraud\\_challenges/respond](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/respond_to_fraud_challenges)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/reverse](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_reverse)\n\n## [Cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/create)[POST/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/update)[GET/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/list)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/deliver](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_deliver)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/fail](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_fail)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/return](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_return)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/ship](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_ship)\n\n## [Physical Bundles](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/physical_bundles)\n\nA Physical Bundle represents the bundle of physical items - card stock, carrier letter, and envelope - that is shipped to a cardholder when you create a physical card.\n\n## [Reader](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/terminal/readers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/create)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/update)[GET/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/retrieve)[GET/v1/terminal/readers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/list)[DELETE/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/delete)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/cancel\\_action](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/cancel_action)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/collect\\_inputs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/collect_inputs)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/confirm\\_payment\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/confirm_payment_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/collect\\_payment\\_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/collect_payment_method)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/process\\_payment\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/process_payment_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/process\\_setup\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/process_setup_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/refund\\_payment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/refund_payment)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/set\\_reader\\_display](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/set_reader_display)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/terminal/readers/:id/present\\_payment\\_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/present_payment_method)\n\n## [Terminal Hardware Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_products)Preview feature\n\nA TerminalHardwareProduct is a category of hardware devices that are generally similar, but may have variations depending on the country it’s shipped to.\n\nTerminalHardwareSKUs represent variations within the same Product (for example, a country specific device). For example, WisePOS E is a TerminalHardwareProduct and a WisePOS E - US and WisePOS E - UK are TerminalHardwareSKUs.\n\n## [Terminal Hardware SKU](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_skus)Preview feature\n\nA TerminalHardwareSKU represents a SKU for Terminal hardware. A SKU is a representation of a product available for purchase, containing information such as the name, price, and images.\n\n## [Transaction Entries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/transaction_entries)\n\nTransactionEntries represent individual units of money movements within a single [Transaction](#transactions).\n\n## [Scheduled Queries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/sigma/scheduled_queries)\n\nIf you have [scheduled a Sigma query](https://docs.stripe.com/sigma/scheduled-queries), you’ll receive a `sigma.scheduled_query_run.created` webhook each time the query runs. The webhook contains a `ScheduledQueryRun` object, which you can use to retrieve the query results.\n\n## [Report Types](https://docs.stripe.com/api/reporting/report_type)\n\nThe Report Type resource corresponds to a particular type of report, such as the “Activity summary” or “Itemized payouts” reports. These objects are identified by an ID belonging to a set of enumerated values. See [API Access to Reports documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/reporting/statements/api) for those Report Type IDs, along with required and optional parameters.\n\nNote that certain report types can only be run based on your live-mode data (not test-mode data), and will error when queried without a [live-mode API key](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#test-live-modes).\n\n## [Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/financial_connections/sessions)\n\nA Financial Connections Session is the secure way to programmatically launch the client-side Stripe.js modal that lets your users link their accounts.\n\n## [Verification Report](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_reports)\n\nA VerificationReport is the result of an attempt to collect and verify data from a user. The collection of verification checks performed is determined from the `type` and `options` parameters used. You can find the result of each verification check performed in the appropriate sub-resource: `document`, `id_number`, `selfie`.\n\nEach VerificationReport contains a copy of any data collected by the user as well as reference IDs which can be used to access collected images through the [FileUpload](https://docs.stripe.com/api/files) API. To configure and create VerificationReports, use the [VerificationSession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_sessions) API.\n\nRelated guide: [Accessing verification results](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verification-sessions#results).\n\n## [Crypto Onramp Quotes](https://docs.stripe.com/api/crypto/onramp_quotes)\n\nCrypto Onramp Quotes are estimated quotes for onramp conversions into all the different cryptocurrencies on different networks. The Quotes API allows you to display quotes in your product UI before directing the user to the onramp widget.\n\nRelated guide: [Quotes API](https://docs.stripe.com/crypto/quotes-api)\n\n## [Climate Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/climate/product)\n\nA Climate product represents a type of carbon removal unit available for reservation. You can retrieve it to see the current price and availability.\n\n## [Forwarding Request](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/request)\n\nInstructs Stripe to make a request on your behalf using the destination URL. The destination URL is activated by Stripe at the time of onboarding. Stripe verifies requests with your credentials provided during onboarding, and injects card details from the payment\\_method into the request.\n\nStripe redacts all sensitive fields and headers, including authentication credentials and card numbers, before storing the request and response data in the forwarding Request object, which are subject to a 30-day retention period.\n\nYou can provide a Stripe idempotency key to make sure that requests with the same key result in only one outbound request. The Stripe idempotency key provided should be unique and different from any idempotency keys provided on the underlying third-party request.\n\nForwarding Requests are synchronous requests that return a response or time out according to Stripe’s limits.\n\nRelated guide: [Forward card details to third-party API endpoints](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/forwarding).\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/create)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/retrieve)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/list)",

You can use SetupAttempts to inspect details of a specific attempt at setting up a payment method using a SetupIntent.\n\n## [Confirmation Token](https://docs.stripe.com/api/confirmation_tokens)\n\nConfirmationTokens help transport client side data collected by Stripe JS over to your server for confirming a PaymentIntent or SetupIntent. If the confirmation is successful, values present on the ConfirmationToken are written onto the Intent.\n\nTo learn more about how to use ConfirmationToken, visit the related guides:\n\n*   [Finalize payments on the server](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/finalize-payments-on-the-server)\n*   [Build two-step confirmation](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/build-a-two-step-confirmation).\n\n## [Tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens)\n\nTokenization is the process Stripe uses to collect sensitive card or bank account details, or personally identifiable information (PII), directly from your customers in a secure manner. A token representing this information is returned to your server to use. Use our [recommended payments integrations](https://docs.stripe.com/payments) to perform this process on the client-side. This guarantees that no sensitive card data touches your server, and allows your integration to operate in a PCI-compliant way.\n\nIf you can’t use client-side tokenization, you can also create tokens using the API with either your publishable or secret API key. If your integration uses this method, you’re responsible for any PCI compliance that it might require, and you must keep your secret API key safe. Unlike with client-side tokenization, your customer’s information isn’t sent directly to Stripe, so we can’t determine how it’s handled or stored.\n\nYou can’t store or use tokens more than once. To store card or bank account information for later use, create [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api#customers) objects or [External accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/api#external_accounts). [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar), our integrated solution for automatic fraud protection, performs best with integrations that use client-side tokenization.\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_account)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_bank_account)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_card)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_cvc_update)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_person)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_pii)[GET/v1/tokens/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/retrieve)\n\n## [Cash Balance](https://docs.stripe.com/api/cash_balance)\n\nA customer’s `Cash balance` represents real funds. Customers can add funds to their cash balance by sending a bank transfer. These funds can be used for payment and can eventually be paid out to your bank account.\n\n## [Customer Portal Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customer_portal/sessions)\n\nThe Billing customer portal is a Stripe-hosted UI for subscription and billing management.\n\nA portal configuration describes the functionality and features that you want to provide to your customers through the portal.\n\nA portal session describes the instantiation of the customer portal for a particular customer. By visiting the session’s URL, the customer can manage their subscriptions and billing details. For security reasons, sessions are short-lived and will expire if the customer does not visit the URL. Create sessions on-demand when customers intend to manage their subscriptions and billing details.\n\nRelated guide: [Customer management](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management)\n\n## [Invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices)\n\nInvoices are statements of amounts owed by a customer, and are either generated one-off, or generated periodically from a subscription.\n\nThey contain [invoice items](#invoiceitems), and proration adjustments that may be caused by subscription upgrades/downgrades (if necessary).\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed through automatic charges, Stripe automatically finalizes your invoice and attempts payment. Note that finalizing the invoice, [when automatic](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/automatic-advancement-collection), does not happen immediately as the invoice is created. Stripe waits until one hour after the last webhook was successfully sent (or the last webhook timed out after failing). If you (and the platforms you may have connected to) have no webhooks configured, Stripe waits one hour after creation to finalize the invoice.\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed by sending an email, then based on your [email settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/billing/automatic), Stripe will email the invoice to your customer and await payment. These emails can contain a link to a hosted page to pay the invoice.\n\nStripe applies any customer credit on the account before determining the amount due for the invoice (i.e., the amount that will be actually charged). If the amount due for the invoice is less than Stripe’s [minimum allowed charge per currency](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts), the invoice is automatically marked paid, and we add the amount due to the customer’s credit balance which is applied to the next invoice.\n\nMore details on the customer’s credit balance are [here](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/customer/balance).\n\nRelated guide: [Send invoices to customers](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/invoices/sending)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create)[POST/v1/invoices/create\\_preview](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create_preview)[POST/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/lines/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_line)[GET/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/retrieve)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming)[GET/v1/invoices/:id/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming_invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/list)[DELETE/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/delete)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/add\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/add_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/remove\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/remove_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/update\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/finalize](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/finalize)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/mark\\_uncollectible](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/mark_uncollectible)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/pay](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/pay)[GET/v1/invoices/search](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/search)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/send](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/send)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/void](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/void)\n\n## [Meter Events](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event)\n\nA billing meter event represents a customer’s usage of a product. Meter events are used to bill a customer based on their usage. Meter events are associated with billing meters, which define the shape of the event’s payload and how those events are aggregated for billing.\n\n## [Meter Event Adjustment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_adjustment)\n\nA billing meter event adjustment is a resource that allows you to cancel a meter event. For example, you might create a billing meter event adjustment to cancel a meter event that was created in error or attached to the wrong customer.\n\n## [Meter Event Summary](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_summary)\n\nA billing meter event summary represents an aggregated view of a customer’s billing meter events within a specified timeframe. It indicates how much usage was accrued by a customer for that period.\n\n## [Plans](https://docs.stripe.com/api/plans)\n\nYou can now model subscriptions more flexibly using the [Prices API](#prices). It replaces the Plans API and is backwards compatible to simplify your migration.\n\nPlans define the base price, currency, and billing cycle for recurring purchases of products. [Products](#products) help you track inventory or provisioning, and plans help you track pricing. Different physical goods or levels of service should be represented by products, and pricing options should be represented by plans. This approach lets you change prices without having to change your provisioning scheme.\n\nFor example, you might have a single “gold” product that has plans for $10/month, $100/year, €9/month, and €90/year.\n\nRelated guides: [Set up a subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/set-up-subscription) and more about [products and prices](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/overview).\n\n## [Tax IDs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_create)[POST/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/create)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_retrieve)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/retrieve)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_list)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/list)[DELETE/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_delete)[DELETE/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/delete)\n\n## [Account Links](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_links)\n\nAccount Links are the means by which a Connect platform grants a connected account permission to access Stripe-hosted applications, such as Connect Onboarding.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect Onboarding](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom/hosted-onboarding)\n\n## [Account Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_sessions)\n\nAn AccountSession allows a Connect platform to grant access to a connected account in Connect embedded components.\n\nWe recommend that you create an AccountSession each time you need to display an embedded component to your user. Do not save AccountSessions to your database as they expire relatively quickly, and cannot be used more than once.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect embedded components](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-connect-embedded-components)\n\n## [Application Fees](https://docs.stripe.com/api/application_fees)\n\nWhen you collect a transaction fee on top of a charge made for your user (using [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)), an `Application Fee` object is created in your account. You can list, retrieve, and refund application fees.\n\nRelated guide: [Collecting application fees](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges#collect-fees)\n\n## [Country Specs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/country_specs)\n\nStripe needs to collect certain pieces of information about each account created. These requirements can differ depending on the account’s country. The Country Specs API makes these rules available to your integration.\n\nYou can also view the information from this API call as [an online guide](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information).\n\n## [Person](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/create)[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/update)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/retrieve)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/list)[DELETE/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/delete)\n\n## [Transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/transfers)\n\nA `Transfer` object is created when you move funds between Stripe accounts as part of Connect.\n\nBefore April 6, 2017, transfers also represented movement of funds from a Stripe account to a card or bank account. This behavior has since been split out into a [Payout](#payout_object) object, with corresponding payout endpoints. For more information, read about the [transfer/payout split](https://docs.stripe.com/transfer-payout-split).\n\nRelated guide: [Creating separate charges and transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n\n## [Secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/secret_management)\n\nSecret Store is an API that allows Stripe Apps developers to securely persist secrets for use by UI Extensions and app backends.\n\nThe primary resource in Secret Store is a `secret`. Other apps can’t view secrets created by an app. Additionally, secrets are scoped to provide further permission control.\n\nAll Dashboard users and the app backend share `account` scoped secrets. Use the `account` scope for secrets that don’t change per-user, like a third-party API key.\n\nA `user` scoped secret is accessible by the app backend and one specific Dashboard user. Use the `user` scope for per-user secrets like per-user OAuth tokens, where different users might have different permissions.\n\nRelated guide: [Store data between page reloads](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/store-auth-data-custom-objects)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[GET/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/list)[POST/v1/apps/secrets/delete](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/delete)[GET/v1/apps/secrets/find](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/find)[POST/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/set)\n\n## [Reviews](https://docs.stripe.com/api/radar/reviews)\n\nReviews can be used to supplement automated fraud detection with human expertise.\n\nLearn more about [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar) and reviewing payments [here](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/reviews).\n\n## [Authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/update)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/list)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/approve](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/approve)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/decline](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/decline)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_create)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/capture](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_capture)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/expire](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_expire)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/finalize\\_amount](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_finalize_amount)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/increment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_increment)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/fraud\\_challenges/respond](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/respond_to_fraud_challenges)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/reverse](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_reverse)\n\n## [Cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/create)[POST/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/update)[GET/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/list)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/deliver](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_deliver)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/fail](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_fail)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/return](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_return)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/ship](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_ship)\n\n## [Physical Bundles](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/physical_bundles)\n\nA Physical Bundle represents the bundle of physical items - card stock, carrier letter, and envelope - that is shipped to a cardholder when you create a physical card.\n\n## [Reader](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/terminal/readers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/create)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/update)[GET/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/retrieve)[GET/v1/terminal/readers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/list)[DELETE/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/delete)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/cancel\\_action](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/cancel_action)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/collect\\_inputs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/collect_inputs)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/confirm\\_payment\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/confirm_payment_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/collect\\_payment\\_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/collect_payment_method)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/process\\_payment\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/process_payment_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/process\\_setup\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/process_setup_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/refund\\_payment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/refund_payment)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/set\\_reader\\_display](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/set_reader_display)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/terminal/readers/:id/present\\_payment\\_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/present_payment_method)\n\n## [Terminal Hardware Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_products)Preview feature\n\nA TerminalHardwareProduct is a category of hardware devices that are generally similar, but may have variations depending on the country it’s shipped to.\n\nTerminalHardwareSKUs represent variations within the same Product (for example, a country specific device). For example, WisePOS E is a TerminalHardwareProduct and a WisePOS E - US and WisePOS E - UK are TerminalHardwareSKUs.\n\n## [Terminal Hardware SKU](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_skus)Preview feature\n\nA TerminalHardwareSKU represents a SKU for Terminal hardware. A SKU is a representation of a product available for purchase, containing information such as the name, price, and images.\n\n## [Transaction Entries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/transaction_entries)\n\nTransactionEntries represent individual units of money movements within a single [Transaction](#transactions).\n\n## [Scheduled Queries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/sigma/scheduled_queries)\n\nIf you have [scheduled a Sigma query](https://docs.stripe.com/sigma/scheduled-queries), you’ll receive a `sigma.scheduled_query_run.created` webhook each time the query runs. The webhook contains a `ScheduledQueryRun` object, which you can use to retrieve the query results.\n\n## [Report Types](https://docs.stripe.com/api/reporting/report_type)\n\nThe Report Type resource corresponds to a particular type of report, such as the “Activity summary” or “Itemized payouts” reports. These objects are identified by an ID belonging to a set of enumerated values. See [API Access to Reports documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/reporting/statements/api) for those Report Type IDs, along with required and optional parameters.\n\nNote that certain report types can only be run based on your live-mode data (not test-mode data), and will error when queried without a [live-mode API key](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#test-live-modes).\n\n## [Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/financial_connections/sessions)\n\nA Financial Connections Session is the secure way to programmatically launch the client-side Stripe.js modal that lets your users link their accounts.\n\n## [Verification Report](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_reports)\n\nA VerificationReport is the result of an attempt to collect and verify data from a user. The collection of verification checks performed is determined from the `type` and `options` parameters used. You can find the result of each verification check performed in the appropriate sub-resource: `document`, `id_number`, `selfie`.\n\nEach VerificationReport contains a copy of any data collected by the user as well as reference IDs which can be used to access collected images through the [FileUpload](https://docs.stripe.com/api/files) API. To configure and create VerificationReports, use the [VerificationSession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_sessions) API.\n\nRelated guide: [Accessing verification results](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verification-sessions#results).\n\n## [Crypto Onramp Quotes](https://docs.stripe.com/api/crypto/onramp_quotes)\n\nCrypto Onramp Quotes are estimated quotes for onramp conversions into all the different cryptocurrencies on different networks. The Quotes API allows you to display quotes in your product UI before directing the user to the onramp widget.\n\nRelated guide: [Quotes API](https://docs.stripe.com/crypto/quotes-api)\n\n## [Climate Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/climate/product)\n\nA Climate product represents a type of carbon removal unit available for reservation. You can retrieve it to see the current price and availability.\n\n## [Forwarding Request](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/request)\n\nInstructs Stripe to make a request on your behalf using the destination URL. The destination URL is activated by Stripe at the time of onboarding. Stripe verifies requests with your credentials provided during onboarding, and injects card details from the payment\\_method into the request.\n\nStripe redacts all sensitive fields and headers, including authentication credentials and card numbers, before storing the request and response data in the forwarding Request object, which are subject to a 30-day retention period.\n\nYou can provide a Stripe idempotency key to make sure that requests with the same key result in only one outbound request. The Stripe idempotency key provided should be unique and different from any idempotency keys provided on the underlying third-party request.\n\nForwarding Requests are synchronous requests that return a response or time out according to Stripe’s limits.\n\nRelated guide: [Forward card details to third-party API endpoints](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/forwarding).\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/create)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/retrieve)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/list)",

For example, you would confirm a SetupIntent when a customer hits the “Save” button on a payment method management page on your website.\n\nIf the selected payment method does not require any additional steps from the customer, the SetupIntent will transition to the `succeeded` status.\n\nOtherwise, it will transition to the `requires_action` status and suggest additional actions via `next_action`. If setup fails, the SetupIntent will transition to the `requires_payment_method` status or the `canceled` status if the confirmation limit is reached.\n\n### Parameters\n\n*   ID of the payment method (a PaymentMethod, Card, or saved Source object) to attach to this SetupIntent.\n    \n\n### More parameters\n\n*   #### \n    \n    payment\\_method\\_dataobject\n    \n*   #### \n    \n    payment\\_method\\_optionsobjectsecret key only\n    \n\n### Returns\n\nReturns the resulting SetupIntent after all possible transitions are applied.\n\nPOST /v1/setup\\_intents/:id/confirm\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/setup_intents/seti_1Mm2cBLkdIwHu7ixaiKW3ElR/confirm \\  -u \"sk_test_4eC39Hq...arjtT1zdp7dcsk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc:\" \\  -d payment_method=pm_card_visa\n```\n\n```\n{  \"id\": \"seti_1Mm2cBLkdIwHu7ixaiKW3ElR\",  \"object\": \"setup_intent\",  \"application\": null,  \"cancellation_reason\": null,  \"client_secret\": \"seti_1Mm2cBLkdIwHu7ixaiKW3ElR_secret_NX6phB7HbSmlkpqzKZ3Bxr7uXFRf9Jg\",  \"created\": 1678918571,  \"customer\": null,  \"description\": null,  \"flow_directions\": null,  \"last_setup_error\": null,  \"latest_attempt\": \"setatt_1Mm2cBLkdIwHu7ixdEp1VkXJ\",  \"livemode\": false,  \"mandate\": null,  \"metadata\": {},  \"next_action\": null,  \"on_behalf_of\": null,  \"payment_method\": \"pm_1Mm2cBLkdIwHu7ixGoOfZSsV\",  \"payment_method_options\": {    \"card\": {      \"mandate_options\": null,      \"network\": null,      \"request_three_d_secure\": \"automatic\"    }  },  \"payment_method_types\": [    \"card\"  ],  \"single_use_mandate\": null,  \"status\": \"succeeded\",  \"usage\": \"off_session\"}\n```\n\n## [Verify microdeposits on a SetupIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_intents/verify_microdeposits)\n\nVerifies microdeposits on a SetupIntent object.\n\n### Parameters\n\n*   Two positive integers, in _cents_, equal to the values of the microdeposits sent to the bank account.\n    \n*   A six-character code starting with SM present in the microdeposit sent to the bank account.\n    \n\n### Returns\n\nReturns a SetupIntent object.\n\nPOST /v1/setup\\_intents/:id/verify\\_microdeposits\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/setup_intents/seti_1Mm5yZLkdIwHu7ixm0sPzrx4/verify_microdeposits \\  -u \"sk_test_4eC39Hq...arjtT1zdp7dcsk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc:\" \\  -d \"amounts[]\"=32 \\  -d \"amounts[]\"=45\n```\n\n```\n{  \"id\": \"seti_1Mm5yZLkdIwHu7ixm0sPzrx4\",  \"object\": \"setup_intent\",  \"application\": null,  \"cancellation_reason\": null,  \"client_secret\": \"seti_1Mm5yZLkdIwHu7ixm0sPzrx4_secret_NXAJ5iPM38ITW1pI7o8VZZhoZyDrrWR\",  \"created\": 1678931491,  \"customer\": null,  \"description\": null,  \"flow_directions\": null,  \"last_setup_error\": null,  \"latest_attempt\": \"setatt_1Mm5yZLkdIwHu7ix7QtOkLAu\",  \"livemode\": false,  \"mandate\": \"mandate_1Mm5yaLkdIwHu7ixmNoLkKLC\",  \"metadata\": {},  \"next_action\": null,  \"on_behalf_of\": null,  \"payment_method\": \"pm_1Mm5yZLkdIwHu7ixf89jW57b\",  \"payment_method_options\": {    \"acss_debit\": {      \"currency\": \"cad\",      \"mandate_options\": {        \"interval_description\": \"First of every month\",        \"payment_schedule\": \"interval\",        \"transaction_type\": \"personal\"      },      \"verification_method\": \"automatic\"    }  },  \"payment_method_types\": [    \"acss_debit\"  ],  \"single_use_mandate\": null,  \"status\": \"succeeded\",  \"usage\": \"off_session\"}\n```\n\n## [Setup Attempts](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_attempts)\n\nA SetupAttempt describes one attempted confirmation of a SetupIntent, whether that confirmation is successful or unsuccessful. You can use SetupAttempts to inspect details of a specific attempt at setting up a payment method using a SetupIntent.\n\n## [Confirmation Token](https://docs.stripe.com/api/confirmation_tokens)\n\nConfirmationTokens help transport client side data collected by Stripe JS over to your server for confirming a PaymentIntent or SetupIntent. If the confirmation is successful, values present on the ConfirmationToken are written onto the Intent.\n\nTo learn more about how to use ConfirmationToken, visit the related guides:\n\n*   [Finalize payments on the server](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/finalize-payments-on-the-server)\n*   [Build two-step confirmation](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/build-a-two-step-confirmation).\n\n## [Tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens)\n\nTokenization is the process Stripe uses to collect sensitive card or bank account details, or personally identifiable information (PII), directly from your customers in a secure manner. A token representing this information is returned to your server to use. Use our [recommended payments integrations](https://docs.stripe.com/payments) to perform this process on the client-side. This guarantees that no sensitive card data touches your server, and allows your integration to operate in a PCI-compliant way.\n\nIf you can’t use client-side tokenization, you can also create tokens using the API with either your publishable or secret API key. If your integration uses this method, you’re responsible for any PCI compliance that it might require, and you must keep your secret API key safe. Unlike with client-side tokenization, your customer’s information isn’t sent directly to Stripe, so we can’t determine how it’s handled or stored.\n\nYou can’t store or use tokens more than once. To store card or bank account information for later use, create [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api#customers) objects or [External accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/api#external_accounts). [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar), our integrated solution for automatic fraud protection, performs best with integrations that use client-side tokenization.\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_account)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_bank_account)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_card)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_cvc_update)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_person)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_pii)[GET/v1/tokens/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/retrieve)\n\n## [Cash Balance](https://docs.stripe.com/api/cash_balance)\n\nA customer’s `Cash balance` represents real funds. Customers can add funds to their cash balance by sending a bank transfer. These funds can be used for payment and can eventually be paid out to your bank account.\n\n## [Customer Portal Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customer_portal/sessions)\n\nThe Billing customer portal is a Stripe-hosted UI for subscription and billing management.\n\nA portal configuration describes the functionality and features that you want to provide to your customers through the portal.\n\nA portal session describes the instantiation of the customer portal for a particular customer. By visiting the session’s URL, the customer can manage their subscriptions and billing details. For security reasons, sessions are short-lived and will expire if the customer does not visit the URL. Create sessions on-demand when customers intend to manage their subscriptions and billing details.\n\nRelated guide: [Customer management](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management)\n\n## [Invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices)\n\nInvoices are statements of amounts owed by a customer, and are either generated one-off, or generated periodically from a subscription.\n\nThey contain [invoice items](#invoiceitems), and proration adjustments that may be caused by subscription upgrades/downgrades (if necessary).\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed through automatic charges, Stripe automatically finalizes your invoice and attempts payment. Note that finalizing the invoice, [when automatic](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/automatic-advancement-collection), does not happen immediately as the invoice is created. Stripe waits until one hour after the last webhook was successfully sent (or the last webhook timed out after failing). If you (and the platforms you may have connected to) have no webhooks configured, Stripe waits one hour after creation to finalize the invoice.\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed by sending an email, then based on your [email settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/billing/automatic), Stripe will email the invoice to your customer and await payment. These emails can contain a link to a hosted page to pay the invoice.\n\nStripe applies any customer credit on the account before determining the amount due for the invoice (i.e., the amount that will be actually charged). If the amount due for the invoice is less than Stripe’s [minimum allowed charge per currency](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts), the invoice is automatically marked paid, and we add the amount due to the customer’s credit balance which is applied to the next invoice.\n\nMore details on the customer’s credit balance are [here](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/customer/balance).\n\nRelated guide: [Send invoices to customers](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/invoices/sending)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create)[POST/v1/invoices/create\\_preview](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create_preview)[POST/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/lines/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_line)[GET/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/retrieve)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming)[GET/v1/invoices/:id/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming_invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/list)[DELETE/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/delete)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/add\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/add_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/remove\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/remove_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/update\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/finalize](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/finalize)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/mark\\_uncollectible](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/mark_uncollectible)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/pay](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/pay)[GET/v1/invoices/search](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/search)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/send](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/send)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/void](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/void)\n\n## [Meter Events](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event)\n\nA billing meter event represents a customer’s usage of a product. Meter events are used to bill a customer based on their usage. Meter events are associated with billing meters, which define the shape of the event’s payload and how those events are aggregated for billing.\n\n## [Meter Event Adjustment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_adjustment)\n\nA billing meter event adjustment is a resource that allows you to cancel a meter event. For example, you might create a billing meter event adjustment to cancel a meter event that was created in error or attached to the wrong customer.\n\n## [Meter Event Summary](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_summary)\n\nA billing meter event summary represents an aggregated view of a customer’s billing meter events within a specified timeframe. It indicates how much usage was accrued by a customer for that period.\n\n## [Plans](https://docs.stripe.com/api/plans)\n\nYou can now model subscriptions more flexibly using the [Prices API](#prices). It replaces the Plans API and is backwards compatible to simplify your migration.\n\nPlans define the base price, currency, and billing cycle for recurring purchases of products. [Products](#products) help you track inventory or provisioning, and plans help you track pricing. Different physical goods or levels of service should be represented by products, and pricing options should be represented by plans. This approach lets you change prices without having to change your provisioning scheme.\n\nFor example, you might have a single “gold” product that has plans for $10/month, $100/year, €9/month, and €90/year.\n\nRelated guides: [Set up a subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/set-up-subscription) and more about [products and prices](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/overview).\n\n## [Tax IDs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_create)[POST/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/create)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_retrieve)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/retrieve)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_list)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/list)[DELETE/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_delete)[DELETE/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/delete)\n\n## [Account Links](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_links)\n\nAccount Links are the means by which a Connect platform grants a connected account permission to access Stripe-hosted applications, such as Connect Onboarding.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect Onboarding](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom/hosted-onboarding)\n\n## [Account Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_sessions)\n\nAn AccountSession allows a Connect platform to grant access to a connected account in Connect embedded components.\n\nWe recommend that you create an AccountSession each time you need to display an embedded component to your user. Do not save AccountSessions to your database as they expire relatively quickly, and cannot be used more than once.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect embedded components](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-connect-embedded-components)\n\n## [Application Fees](https://docs.stripe.com/api/application_fees)\n\nWhen you collect a transaction fee on top of a charge made for your user (using [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)), an `Application Fee` object is created in your account. You can list, retrieve, and refund application fees.\n\nRelated guide: [Collecting application fees](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges#collect-fees)\n\n## [Country Specs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/country_specs)\n\nStripe needs to collect certain pieces of information about each account created. These requirements can differ depending on the account’s country. The Country Specs API makes these rules available to your integration.\n\nYou can also view the information from this API call as [an online guide](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information).\n\n## [Person](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/create)[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/update)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/retrieve)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/list)[DELETE/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/delete)\n\n## [Transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/transfers)\n\nA `Transfer` object is created when you move funds between Stripe accounts as part of Connect.\n\nBefore April 6, 2017, transfers also represented movement of funds from a Stripe account to a card or bank account. This behavior has since been split out into a [Payout](#payout_object) object, with corresponding payout endpoints. For more information, read about the [transfer/payout split](https://docs.stripe.com/transfer-payout-split).\n\nRelated guide: [Creating separate charges and transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n\n## [Secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/secret_management)\n\nSecret Store is an API that allows Stripe Apps developers to securely persist secrets for use by UI Extensions and app backends.\n\nThe primary resource in Secret Store is a `secret`. Other apps can’t view secrets created by an app. Additionally, secrets are scoped to provide further permission control.\n\nAll Dashboard users and the app backend share `account` scoped secrets. Use the `account` scope for secrets that don’t change per-user, like a third-party API key.\n\nA `user` scoped secret is accessible by the app backend and one specific Dashboard user. Use the `user` scope for per-user secrets like per-user OAuth tokens, where different users might have different permissions.\n\nRelated guide: [Store data between page reloads](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/store-auth-data-custom-objects)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[GET/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/list)[POST/v1/apps/secrets/delete](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/delete)[GET/v1/apps/secrets/find](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/find)[POST/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/set)\n\n## [Reviews](https://docs.stripe.com/api/radar/reviews)\n\nReviews can be used to supplement automated fraud detection with human expertise.\n\nLearn more about [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar) and reviewing payments [here](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/reviews).\n\n## [Authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/update)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/list)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/approve](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/approve)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/decline](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/decline)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_create)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/capture](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_capture)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/expire](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_expire)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/finalize\\_amount](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_finalize_amount)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/increment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_increment)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/fraud\\_challenges/respond](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/respond_to_fraud_challenges)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/reverse](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_reverse)\n\n## [Cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/create)[POST/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/update)[GET/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/list)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/deliver](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_deliver)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/fail](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_fail)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/return](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_return)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/ship](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_ship)\n\n## [Physical Bundles](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/physical_bundles)\n\nA Physical Bundle represents the bundle of physical items - card stock, carrier letter, and envelope - that is shipped to a cardholder when you create a physical card.\n\n## [Reader](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/terminal/readers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/create)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/update)[GET/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/retrieve)[GET/v1/terminal/readers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/list)[DELETE/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/delete)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/cancel\\_action](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/cancel_action)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/collect\\_inputs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/collect_inputs)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/confirm\\_payment\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/confirm_payment_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/collect\\_payment\\_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/collect_payment_method)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/process\\_payment\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/process_payment_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/process\\_setup\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/process_setup_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/refund\\_payment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/refund_payment)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/set\\_reader\\_display](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/set_reader_display)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/terminal/readers/:id/present\\_payment\\_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/present_payment_method)\n\n## [Terminal Hardware Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_products)Preview feature\n\nA TerminalHardwareProduct is a category of hardware devices that are generally similar, but may have variations depending on the country it’s shipped to.\n\nTerminalHardwareSKUs represent variations within the same Product (for example, a country specific device). For example, WisePOS E is a TerminalHardwareProduct and a WisePOS E - US and WisePOS E - UK are TerminalHardwareSKUs.\n\n## [Terminal Hardware SKU](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_skus)Preview feature\n\nA TerminalHardwareSKU represents a SKU for Terminal hardware. A SKU is a representation of a product available for purchase, containing information such as the name, price, and images.\n\n## [Transaction Entries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/transaction_entries)\n\nTransactionEntries represent individual units of money movements within a single [Transaction](#transactions).\n\n## [Scheduled Queries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/sigma/scheduled_queries)\n\nIf you have [scheduled a Sigma query](https://docs.stripe.com/sigma/scheduled-queries), you’ll receive a `sigma.scheduled_query_run.created` webhook each time the query runs. The webhook contains a `ScheduledQueryRun` object, which you can use to retrieve the query results.\n\n## [Report Types](https://docs.stripe.com/api/reporting/report_type)\n\nThe Report Type resource corresponds to a particular type of report, such as the “Activity summary” or “Itemized payouts” reports. These objects are identified by an ID belonging to a set of enumerated values. See [API Access to Reports documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/reporting/statements/api) for those Report Type IDs, along with required and optional parameters.\n\nNote that certain report types can only be run based on your live-mode data (not test-mode data), and will error when queried without a [live-mode API key](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#test-live-modes).\n\n## [Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/financial_connections/sessions)\n\nA Financial Connections Session is the secure way to programmatically launch the client-side Stripe.js modal that lets your users link their accounts.\n\n## [Verification Report](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_reports)\n\nA VerificationReport is the result of an attempt to collect and verify data from a user. The collection of verification checks performed is determined from the `type` and `options` parameters used. You can find the result of each verification check performed in the appropriate sub-resource: `document`, `id_number`, `selfie`.\n\nEach VerificationReport contains a copy of any data collected by the user as well as reference IDs which can be used to access collected images through the [FileUpload](https://docs.stripe.com/api/files) API. To configure and create VerificationReports, use the [VerificationSession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_sessions) API.\n\nRelated guide: [Accessing verification results](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verification-sessions#results).\n\n## [Crypto Onramp Quotes](https://docs.stripe.com/api/crypto/onramp_quotes)\n\nCrypto Onramp Quotes are estimated quotes for onramp conversions into all the different cryptocurrencies on different networks. The Quotes API allows you to display quotes in your product UI before directing the user to the onramp widget.\n\nRelated guide: [Quotes API](https://docs.stripe.com/crypto/quotes-api)\n\n## [Climate Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/climate/product)\n\nA Climate product represents a type of carbon removal unit available for reservation. You can retrieve it to see the current price and availability.\n\n## [Forwarding Request](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/request)\n\nInstructs Stripe to make a request on your behalf using the destination URL. The destination URL is activated by Stripe at the time of onboarding. Stripe verifies requests with your credentials provided during onboarding, and injects card details from the payment\\_method into the request.\n\nStripe redacts all sensitive fields and headers, including authentication credentials and card numbers, before storing the request and response data in the forwarding Request object, which are subject to a 30-day retention period.\n\nYou can provide a Stripe idempotency key to make sure that requests with the same key result in only one outbound request. The Stripe idempotency key provided should be unique and different from any idempotency keys provided on the underlying third-party request.\n\nForwarding Requests are synchronous requests that return a response or time out according to Stripe’s limits.\n\nRelated guide: [Forward card details to third-party API endpoints](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/forwarding).\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/create)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/retrieve)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/list)",

These approaches will perform any necessary steps to set up the PaymentMethod for future payments. Using the `/v1/payment_methods/:id/attach` endpoint without first using a SetupIntent or PaymentIntent with `setup_future_usage` does not optimize the PaymentMethod for future use, which makes later declines and payment friction more likely. See [Optimizing cards for future payments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents#future-usage) for more information about setting up future payments.\n\nTo use this PaymentMethod as the default for invoice or subscription payments, set [`invoice_settings.default_payment_method`](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/update#update_customer-invoice_settings-default_payment_method), on the Customer to the PaymentMethod’s ID.\n\n### Parameters\n\n*   The ID of the customer to which to attach the PaymentMethod.\n    \n\n### Returns\n\nReturns a PaymentMethod object.\n\nPOST /v1/payment\\_methods/:id/attach\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/payment_methods/pm_1MqM05LkdIwHu7ixlDxxO6Mc/attach \\  -u \"sk_test_4eC39Hq...arjtT1zdp7dcsk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc:\" \\  -d customer=cus_NbZ8Ki3f322LNn\n```\n\n```\n{  \"id\": \"pm_1MqM05LkdIwHu7ixlDxxO6Mc\",  \"object\": \"payment_method\",  \"billing_details\": {    \"address\": {      \"city\": null,      \"country\": null,      \"line1\": null,      \"line2\": null,      \"postal_code\": null,      \"state\": null    },    \"email\": null,    \"name\": null,    \"phone\": null  },  \"card\": {    \"brand\": \"visa\",    \"checks\": {      \"address_line1_check\": null,      \"address_postal_code_check\": null,      \"cvc_check\": \"pass\"    },    \"country\": \"US\",    \"exp_month\": 8,    \"exp_year\": 2026,    \"fingerprint\": \"mToisGZ01V71BCos\",    \"funding\": \"credit\",    \"generated_from\": null,    \"last4\": \"4242\",    \"networks\": {      \"available\": [        \"visa\"      ],      \"preferred\": null    },    \"three_d_secure_usage\": {      \"supported\": true    },    \"wallet\": null  },  \"created\": 1679946402,  \"customer\": \"cus_NbZ8Ki3f322LNn\",  \"livemode\": false,  \"metadata\": {},  \"type\": \"card\"}\n```\n\n## [Detach a PaymentMethod from a Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods/detach)\n\nDetaches a PaymentMethod object from a Customer.

You can use SetupAttempts to inspect details of a specific attempt at setting up a payment method using a SetupIntent.\n\n## [Confirmation Token](https://docs.stripe.com/api/confirmation_tokens)\n\nConfirmationTokens help transport client side data collected by Stripe JS over to your server for confirming a PaymentIntent or SetupIntent. If the confirmation is successful, values present on the ConfirmationToken are written onto the Intent.\n\nTo learn more about how to use ConfirmationToken, visit the related guides:\n\n*   [Finalize payments on the server](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/finalize-payments-on-the-server)\n*   [Build two-step confirmation](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/build-a-two-step-confirmation).\n\n## [Tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens)\n\nTokenization is the process Stripe uses to collect sensitive card or bank account details, or personally identifiable information (PII), directly from your customers in a secure manner. A token representing this information is returned to your server to use. Use our [recommended payments integrations](https://docs.stripe.com/payments) to perform this process on the client-side. This guarantees that no sensitive card data touches your server, and allows your integration to operate in a PCI-compliant way.\n\nIf you can’t use client-side tokenization, you can also create tokens using the API with either your publishable or secret API key. If your integration uses this method, you’re responsible for any PCI compliance that it might require, and you must keep your secret API key safe. Unlike with client-side tokenization, your customer’s information isn’t sent directly to Stripe, so we can’t determine how it’s handled or stored.\n\nYou can’t store or use tokens more than once. To store card or bank account information for later use, create [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api#customers) objects or [External accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/api#external_accounts). [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar), our integrated solution for automatic fraud protection, performs best with integrations that use client-side tokenization.\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_account)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_bank_account)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_card)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_cvc_update)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_person)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_pii)[GET/v1/tokens/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/retrieve)\n\n## [Cash Balance](https://docs.stripe.com/api/cash_balance)\n\nA customer’s `Cash balance` represents real funds. Customers can add funds to their cash balance by sending a bank transfer. These funds can be used for payment and can eventually be paid out to your bank account.\n\n## [Customer Portal Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customer_portal/sessions)\n\nThe Billing customer portal is a Stripe-hosted UI for subscription and billing management.\n\nA portal configuration describes the functionality and features that you want to provide to your customers through the portal.\n\nA portal session describes the instantiation of the customer portal for a particular customer. By visiting the session’s URL, the customer can manage their subscriptions and billing details. For security reasons, sessions are short-lived and will expire if the customer does not visit the URL. Create sessions on-demand when customers intend to manage their subscriptions and billing details.\n\nRelated guide: [Customer management](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management)\n\n## [Invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices)\n\nInvoices are statements of amounts owed by a customer, and are either generated one-off, or generated periodically from a subscription.\n\nThey contain [invoice items](#invoiceitems), and proration adjustments that may be caused by subscription upgrades/downgrades (if necessary).\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed through automatic charges, Stripe automatically finalizes your invoice and attempts payment. Note that finalizing the invoice, [when automatic](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/automatic-advancement-collection), does not happen immediately as the invoice is created. Stripe waits until one hour after the last webhook was successfully sent (or the last webhook timed out after failing). If you (and the platforms you may have connected to) have no webhooks configured, Stripe waits one hour after creation to finalize the invoice.\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed by sending an email, then based on your [email settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/billing/automatic), Stripe will email the invoice to your customer and await payment. These emails can contain a link to a hosted page to pay the invoice.\n\nStripe applies any customer credit on the account before determining the amount due for the invoice (i.e., the amount that will be actually charged). If the amount due for the invoice is less than Stripe’s [minimum allowed charge per currency](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts), the invoice is automatically marked paid, and we add the amount due to the customer’s credit balance which is applied to the next invoice.\n\nMore details on the customer’s credit balance are [here](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/customer/balance).\n\nRelated guide: [Send invoices to customers](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/invoices/sending)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create)[POST/v1/invoices/create\\_preview](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create_preview)[POST/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/lines/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_line)[GET/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/retrieve)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming)[GET/v1/invoices/:id/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming_invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/list)[DELETE/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/delete)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/add\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/add_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/remove\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/remove_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/update\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/finalize](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/finalize)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/mark\\_uncollectible](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/mark_uncollectible)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/pay](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/pay)[GET/v1/invoices/search](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/search)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/send](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/send)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/void](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/void)\n\n## [Meter Events](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event)\n\nA billing meter event represents a customer’s usage of a product.

Meter events are associated with billing meters, which define the shape of the event’s payload and how those events are aggregated for billing.\n\n## [Meter Event Adjustment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_adjustment)\n\nA billing meter event adjustment is a resource that allows you to cancel a meter event. For example, you might create a billing meter event adjustment to cancel a meter event that was created in error or attached to the wrong customer.\n\n## [Meter Event Summary](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_summary)\n\nA billing meter event summary represents an aggregated view of a customer’s billing meter events within a specified timeframe. It indicates how much usage was accrued by a customer for that period.\n\n## [Plans](https://docs.stripe.com/api/plans)\n\nYou can now model subscriptions more flexibly using the [Prices API](#prices). It replaces the Plans API and is backwards compatible to simplify your migration.\n\nPlans define the base price, currency, and billing cycle for recurring purchases of products. [Products](#products) help you track inventory or provisioning, and plans help you track pricing. Different physical goods or levels of service should be represented by products, and pricing options should be represented by plans. This approach lets you change prices without having to change your provisioning scheme.\n\nFor example, you might have a single “gold” product that has plans for $10/month, $100/year, €9/month, and €90/year.\n\nRelated guides: [Set up a subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/set-up-subscription) and more about [products and prices](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/overview).\n\n## [Tax IDs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_create)[POST/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/create)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_retrieve)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/retrieve)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_list)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/list)[DELETE/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_delete)[DELETE/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/delete)\n\n## [Account Links](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_links)\n\nAccount Links are the means by which a Connect platform grants a connected account permission to access Stripe-hosted applications, such as Connect Onboarding.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect Onboarding](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom/hosted-onboarding)\n\n## [Account Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_sessions)\n\nAn AccountSession allows a Connect platform to grant access to a connected account in Connect embedded components.\n\nWe recommend that you create an AccountSession each time you need to display an embedded component to your user. Do not save AccountSessions to your database as they expire relatively quickly, and cannot be used more than once.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect embedded components](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-connect-embedded-components)\n\n## [Application Fees](https://docs.stripe.com/api/application_fees)\n\nWhen you collect a transaction fee on top of a charge made for your user (using [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)), an `Application Fee` object is created in your account. You can list, retrieve, and refund application fees.\n\nRelated guide: [Collecting application fees](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges#collect-fees)\n\n## [Country Specs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/country_specs)\n\nStripe needs to collect certain pieces of information about each account created. These requirements can differ depending on the account’s country. The Country Specs API makes these rules available to your integration.\n\nYou can also view the information from this API call as [an online guide](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information).\n\n## [Person](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/create)[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/update)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/retrieve)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/list)[DELETE/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/delete)\n\n## [Transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/transfers)\n\nA `Transfer` object is created when you move funds between Stripe accounts as part of Connect.\n\nBefore April 6, 2017, transfers also represented movement of funds from a Stripe account to a card or bank account. This behavior has since been split out into a [Payout](#payout_object) object, with corresponding payout endpoints. For more information, read about the [transfer/payout split](https://docs.stripe.com/transfer-payout-split).\n\nRelated guide: [Creating separate charges and transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n\n## [Secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/secret_management)\n\nSecret Store is an API that allows Stripe Apps developers to securely persist secrets for use by UI Extensions and app backends.\n\nThe primary resource in Secret Store is a `secret`. Other apps can’t view secrets created by an app. Additionally, secrets are scoped to provide further permission control.\n\nAll Dashboard users and the app backend share `account` scoped secrets. Use the `account` scope for secrets that don’t change per-user, like a third-party API key.\n\nA `user` scoped secret is accessible by the app backend and one specific Dashboard user. Use the `user` scope for per-user secrets like per-user OAuth tokens, where different users might have different permissions.\n\nRelated guide: [Store data between page reloads](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/store-auth-data-custom-objects)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[GET/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/list)[POST/v1/apps/secrets/delete](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/delete)[GET/v1/apps/secrets/find](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/find)[POST/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/set)\n\n## [Reviews](https://docs.stripe.com/api/radar/reviews)\n\nReviews can be used to supplement automated fraud detection with human expertise.\n\nLearn more about [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar) and reviewing payments [here](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/reviews).\n\n## [Authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/update)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/list)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/approve](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/approve)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/decline](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/decline)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_create)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/capture](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_capture)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/expire](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_expire)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/finalize\\_amount](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_finalize_amount)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/increment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_increment)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/fraud\\_challenges/respond](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/respond_to_fraud_challenges)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/reverse](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_reverse)\n\n## [Cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/create)[POST/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/update)[GET/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/list)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/deliver](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_deliver)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/fail](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_fail)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/return](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_return)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/ship](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_ship)\n\n## [Physical Bundles](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/physical_bundles)\n\nA Physical Bundle represents the bundle of physical items -

For example, WisePOS E is a TerminalHardwareProduct and a WisePOS E - US and WisePOS E - UK are TerminalHardwareSKUs.\n\n## [Terminal Hardware SKU](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_skus)Preview feature\n\nA TerminalHardwareSKU represents a SKU for Terminal hardware. A SKU is a representation of a product available for purchase, containing information such as the name, price, and images.\n\n## [Transaction Entries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/transaction_entries)\n\nTransactionEntries represent individual units of money movements within a single [Transaction](#transactions).\n\n## [Scheduled Queries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/sigma/scheduled_queries)\n\nIf you have [scheduled a Sigma query](https://docs.stripe.com/sigma/scheduled-queries), you’ll receive a `sigma.scheduled_query_run.created` webhook each time the query runs. The webhook contains a `ScheduledQueryRun` object, which you can use to retrieve the query results.\n\n## [Report Types](https://docs.stripe.com/api/reporting/report_type)\n\nThe Report Type resource corresponds to a particular type of report, such as the “Activity summary” or “Itemized payouts” reports. These objects are identified by an ID belonging to a set of enumerated values. See [API Access to Reports documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/reporting/statements/api) for those Report Type IDs, along with required and optional parameters.\n\nNote that certain report types can only be run based on your live-mode data (not test-mode data), and will error when queried without a [live-mode API key](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#test-live-modes).\n\n## [Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/financial_connections/sessions)\n\nA Financial Connections Session is the secure way to programmatically launch the client-side Stripe.js modal that lets your users link their accounts.\n\n## [Verification Report](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_reports)\n\nA VerificationReport is the result of an attempt to collect and verify data from a user. The collection of verification checks performed is determined from the `type` and `options` parameters used. You can find the result of each verification check performed in the appropriate sub-resource: `document`, `id_number`, `selfie`.\n\nEach VerificationReport contains a copy of any data collected by the user as well as reference IDs which can be used to access collected images through the [FileUpload](https://docs.stripe.com/api/files) API. To configure and create VerificationReports, use the [VerificationSession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_sessions) API.\n\nRelated guide: [Accessing verification results](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verification-sessions#results).\n\n## [Crypto Onramp Quotes](https://docs.stripe.com/api/crypto/onramp_quotes)\n\nCrypto Onramp Quotes are estimated quotes for onramp conversions into all the different cryptocurrencies on different networks. The Quotes API allows you to display quotes in your product UI before directing the user to the onramp widget.\n\nRelated guide: [Quotes API](https://docs.stripe.com/crypto/quotes-api)\n\n## [Climate Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/climate/product)\n\nA Climate product represents a type of carbon removal unit available for reservation. You can retrieve it to see the current price and availability.\n\n## [Forwarding Request](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/request)\n\nInstructs Stripe to make a request on your behalf using the destination URL. The destination URL is activated by Stripe at the time of onboarding. Stripe verifies requests with your credentials provided during onboarding, and injects card details from the payment\\_method into the request.\n\nStripe redacts all sensitive fields and headers, including authentication credentials and card numbers, before storing the request and response data in the forwarding Request object, which are subject to a 30-day retention period.\n\nYou can provide a Stripe idempotency key to make sure that requests with the same key result in only one outbound request. The Stripe idempotency key provided should be unique and different from any idempotency keys provided on the underlying third-party request.\n\nForwarding Requests are synchronous requests that return a response or time out according to Stripe’s limits.\n\nRelated guide: [Forward card details to third-party API endpoints](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/forwarding).\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/create)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/retrieve)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/list)",

You can use SetupAttempts to inspect details of a specific attempt at setting up a payment method using a SetupIntent.\n\n## [Confirmation Token](https://docs.stripe.com/api/confirmation_tokens)\n\nConfirmationTokens help transport client side data collected by Stripe JS over to your server for confirming a PaymentIntent or SetupIntent. If the confirmation is successful, values present on the ConfirmationToken are written onto the Intent.\n\nTo learn more about how to use ConfirmationToken, visit the related guides:\n\n*   [Finalize payments on the server](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/finalize-payments-on-the-server)\n*   [Build two-step confirmation](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/build-a-two-step-confirmation).\n\n## [Tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens)\n\nTokenization is the process Stripe uses to collect sensitive card or bank account details, or personally identifiable information (PII), directly from your customers in a secure manner. A token representing this information is returned to your server to use. Use our [recommended payments integrations](https://docs.stripe.com/payments) to perform this process on the client-side. This guarantees that no sensitive card data touches your server, and allows your integration to operate in a PCI-compliant way.\n\nIf you can’t use client-side tokenization, you can also create tokens using the API with either your publishable or secret API key. If your integration uses this method, you’re responsible for any PCI compliance that it might require, and you must keep your secret API key safe. Unlike with client-side tokenization, your customer’s information isn’t sent directly to Stripe, so we can’t determine how it’s handled or stored.\n\nYou can’t store or use tokens more than once. To store card or bank account information for later use, create [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api#customers) objects or [External accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/api#external_accounts). [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar), our integrated solution for automatic fraud protection, performs best with integrations that use client-side tokenization.\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_account)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_bank_account)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_card)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_cvc_update)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_person)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_pii)[GET/v1/tokens/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/retrieve)\n\n## [Cash Balance](https://docs.stripe.com/api/cash_balance)\n\nA customer’s `Cash balance` represents real funds. Customers can add funds to their cash balance by sending a bank transfer. These funds can be used for payment and can eventually be paid out to your bank account.\n\n## [Customer Portal Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customer_portal/sessions)\n\nThe Billing customer portal is a Stripe-hosted UI for subscription and billing management.\n\nA portal configuration describes the functionality and features that you want to provide to your customers through the portal.\n\nA portal session describes the instantiation of the customer portal for a particular customer. By visiting the session’s URL, the customer can manage their subscriptions and billing details. For security reasons, sessions are short-lived and will expire if the customer does not visit the URL. Create sessions on-demand when customers intend to manage their subscriptions and billing details.\n\nRelated guide: [Customer management](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management)\n\n## [Invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices)\n\nInvoices are statements of amounts owed by a customer, and are either generated one-off, or generated periodically from a subscription.\n\nThey contain [invoice items](#invoiceitems), and proration adjustments that may be caused by subscription upgrades/downgrades (if necessary).\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed through automatic charges, Stripe automatically finalizes your invoice and attempts payment. Note that finalizing the invoice, [when automatic](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/automatic-advancement-collection), does not happen immediately as the invoice is created. Stripe waits until one hour after the last webhook was successfully sent (or the last webhook timed out after failing). If you (and the platforms you may have connected to) have no webhooks configured, Stripe waits one hour after creation to finalize the invoice.\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed by sending an email, then based on your [email settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/billing/automatic), Stripe will email the invoice to your customer and await payment. These emails can contain a link to a hosted page to pay the invoice.\n\nStripe applies any customer credit on the account before determining the amount due for the invoice (i.e., the amount that will be actually charged). If the amount due for the invoice is less than Stripe’s [minimum allowed charge per currency](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts), the invoice is automatically marked paid, and we add the amount due to the customer’s credit balance which is applied to the next invoice.\n\nMore details on the customer’s credit balance are [here](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/customer/balance).\n\nRelated guide: [Send invoices to customers](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/invoices/sending)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create)[POST/v1/invoices/create\\_preview](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create_preview)[POST/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/lines/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_line)[GET/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/retrieve)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming)[GET/v1/invoices/:id/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming_invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/list)[DELETE/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/delete)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/add\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/add_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/remove\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/remove_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/update\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/finalize](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/finalize)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/mark\\_uncollectible](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/mark_uncollectible)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/pay](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/pay)[GET/v1/invoices/search](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/search)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/send](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/send)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/void](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/void)\n\n## [Meter Events](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event)\n\nA billing meter event represents a customer’s usage of a product. Meter events are used to bill a customer based on their usage. Meter events are associated with billing meters, which define the shape of the event’s payload and how those events are aggregated for billing.\n\n## [Meter Event Adjustment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_adjustment)\n\nA billing meter event adjustment is a resource that allows you to cancel a meter event. For example, you might create a billing meter event adjustment to cancel a meter event that was created in error or attached to the wrong customer.\n\n## [Meter Event Summary](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_summary)\n\nA billing meter event summary represents an aggregated view of a customer’s billing meter events within a specified timeframe. It indicates how much usage was accrued by a customer for that period.\n\n## [Plans](https://docs.stripe.com/api/plans)\n\nYou can now model subscriptions more flexibly using the [Prices API](#prices). It replaces the Plans API and is backwards compatible to simplify your migration.\n\nPlans define the base price, currency, and billing cycle for recurring purchases of products. [Products](#products) help you track inventory or provisioning, and plans help you track pricing. Different physical goods or levels of service should be represented by products, and pricing options should be represented by plans. This approach lets you change prices without having to change your provisioning scheme.\n\nFor example, you might have a single “gold” product that has plans for $10/month, $100/year, €9/month, and €90/year.\n\nRelated guides: [Set up a subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/set-up-subscription) and more about [products and prices](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/overview).\n\n## [Tax IDs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_create)[POST/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/create)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_retrieve)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/retrieve)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_list)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/list)[DELETE/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_delete)[DELETE/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/delete)\n\n## [Account Links](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_links)\n\nAccount Links are the means by which a Connect platform grants a connected account permission to access Stripe-hosted applications, such as Connect Onboarding.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect Onboarding](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom/hosted-onboarding)\n\n## [Account Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_sessions)\n\nAn AccountSession allows a Connect platform to grant access to a connected account in Connect embedded components.\n\nWe recommend that you create an AccountSession each time you need to display an embedded component to your user. Do not save AccountSessions to your database as they expire relatively quickly, and cannot be used more than once.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect embedded components](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-connect-embedded-components)\n\n## [Application Fees](https://docs.stripe.com/api/application_fees)\n\nWhen you collect a transaction fee on top of a charge made for your user (using [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)), an `Application Fee` object is created in your account. You can list, retrieve, and refund application fees.\n\nRelated guide: [Collecting application fees](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges#collect-fees)\n\n## [Country Specs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/country_specs)\n\nStripe needs to collect certain pieces of information about each account created. These requirements can differ depending on the account’s country. The Country Specs API makes these rules available to your integration.\n\nYou can also view the information from this API call as [an online guide](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information).\n\n## [Person](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/create)[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/update)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/retrieve)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/list)[DELETE/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/delete)\n\n## [Transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/transfers)\n\nA `Transfer` object is created when you move funds between Stripe accounts as part of Connect.\n\nBefore April 6, 2017, transfers also represented movement of funds from a Stripe account to a card or bank account. This behavior has since been split out into a [Payout](#payout_object) object, with corresponding payout endpoints. For more information, read about the [transfer/payout split](https://docs.stripe.com/transfer-payout-split).\n\nRelated guide: [Creating separate charges and transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n\n## [Secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/secret_management)\n\nSecret Store is an API that allows Stripe Apps developers to securely persist secrets for use by UI Extensions and app backends.\n\nThe primary resource in Secret Store is a `secret`. Other apps can’t view secrets created by an app. Additionally, secrets are scoped to provide further permission control.\n\nAll Dashboard users and the app backend share `account` scoped secrets. Use the `account` scope for secrets that don’t change per-user, like a third-party API key.\n\nA `user` scoped secret is accessible by the app backend and one specific Dashboard user. Use the `user` scope for per-user secrets like per-user OAuth tokens, where different users might have different permissions.\n\nRelated guide: [Store data between page reloads](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/store-auth-data-custom-objects)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[GET/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/list)[POST/v1/apps/secrets/delete](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/delete)[GET/v1/apps/secrets/find](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/find)[POST/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/set)\n\n## [Reviews](https://docs.stripe.com/api/radar/reviews)\n\nReviews can be used to supplement automated fraud detection with human expertise.\n\nLearn more about [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar) and reviewing payments [here](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/reviews).\n\n## [Authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/update)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/list)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/approve](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/approve)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/decline](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/decline)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_create)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/capture](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_capture)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/expire](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_expire)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/finalize\\_amount](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_finalize_amount)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/increment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_increment)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/fraud\\_challenges/respond](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/respond_to_fraud_challenges)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/reverse](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_reverse)\n\n## [Cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/create)[POST/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/update)[GET/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/list)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/deliver](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_deliver)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/fail](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_fail)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/return](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_return)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/ship](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_ship)\n\n## [Physical Bundles](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/physical_bundles)\n\nA Physical Bundle represents the bundle of physical items -

For example, WisePOS E is a TerminalHardwareProduct and a WisePOS E - US and WisePOS E - UK are TerminalHardwareSKUs.\n\n## [Terminal Hardware SKU](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_skus)Preview feature\n\nA TerminalHardwareSKU represents a SKU for Terminal hardware. A SKU is a representation of a product available for purchase, containing information such as the name, price, and images.\n\n## [Transaction Entries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/transaction_entries)\n\nTransactionEntries represent individual units of money movements within a single [Transaction](#transactions).\n\n## [Scheduled Queries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/sigma/scheduled_queries)\n\nIf you have [scheduled a Sigma query](https://docs.stripe.com/sigma/scheduled-queries), you’ll receive a `sigma.scheduled_query_run.created` webhook each time the query runs. The webhook contains a `ScheduledQueryRun` object, which you can use to retrieve the query results.\n\n## [Report Types](https://docs.stripe.com/api/reporting/report_type)\n\nThe Report Type resource corresponds to a particular type of report, such as the “Activity summary” or “Itemized payouts” reports. These objects are identified by an ID belonging to a set of enumerated values. See [API Access to Reports documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/reporting/statements/api) for those Report Type IDs, along with required and optional parameters.\n\nNote that certain report types can only be run based on your live-mode data (not test-mode data), and will error when queried without a [live-mode API key](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#test-live-modes).\n\n## [Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/financial_connections/sessions)\n\nA Financial Connections Session is the secure way to programmatically launch the client-side Stripe.js modal that lets your users link their accounts.\n\n## [Verification Report](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_reports)\n\nA VerificationReport is the result of an attempt to collect and verify data from a user. The collection of verification checks performed is determined from the `type` and `options` parameters used. You can find the result of each verification check performed in the appropriate sub-resource: `document`, `id_number`, `selfie`.\n\nEach VerificationReport contains a copy of any data collected by the user as well as reference IDs which can be used to access collected images through the [FileUpload](https://docs.stripe.com/api/files) API. To configure and create VerificationReports, use the [VerificationSession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_sessions) API.\n\nRelated guide: [Accessing verification results](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verification-sessions#results).\n\n## [Crypto Onramp Quotes](https://docs.stripe.com/api/crypto/onramp_quotes)\n\nCrypto Onramp Quotes are estimated quotes for onramp conversions into all the different cryptocurrencies on different networks. The Quotes API allows you to display quotes in your product UI before directing the user to the onramp widget.\n\nRelated guide: [Quotes API](https://docs.stripe.com/crypto/quotes-api)\n\n## [Climate Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/climate/product)\n\nA Climate product represents a type of carbon removal unit available for reservation. You can retrieve it to see the current price and availability.\n\n## [Forwarding Request](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/request)\n\nInstructs Stripe to make a request on your behalf using the destination URL. The destination URL is activated by Stripe at the time of onboarding. Stripe verifies requests with your credentials provided during onboarding, and injects card details from the payment\\_method into the request.\n\nStripe redacts all sensitive fields and headers, including authentication credentials and card numbers, before storing the request and response data in the forwarding Request object, which are subject to a 30-day retention period.\n\nYou can provide a Stripe idempotency key to make sure that requests with the same key result in only one outbound request. The Stripe idempotency key provided should be unique and different from any idempotency keys provided on the underlying third-party request.\n\nForwarding Requests are synchronous requests that return a response or time out according to Stripe’s limits.\n\nRelated guide: [Forward card details to third-party API endpoints](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/forwarding).\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/create)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/retrieve)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/list)",

If you delete a card that is currently the default source, then the most recently added source will become the new default. If you delete a card that is the last remaining source on the customer, then the default\\_source attribute will become null.\n\nFor recipients: if you delete the default card, then the most recently added card will become the new default. If you delete the last remaining card on a recipient, then the default\\_card attribute will become null.\n\nNote that for cards belonging to customers, you might want to prevent customers on paid subscriptions from deleting all cards on file, so that there is at least one default card for the next invoice payment attempt.\n\n### Parameters\n\nNo parameters.\n\n### Returns\n\nDELETE /v1/customers/:id/sources/:id\n\n```\ncurl -X DELETE https://api.stripe.com/v1/customers/acct_1032D82eZvKYlo2C/sources/card_1NGTaT2eZvKYlo2CZWSctn5n \\  -u \"sk_test_4eC39Hq...arjtT1zdp7dcsk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc:\"\n```\n\n```\n{  \"id\": \"card_1NGTaT2eZvKYlo2CZWSctn5n\",  \"object\": \"card\",  \"deleted\": true}\n```\n\n## [Customer Portal Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customer_portal/sessions)\n\nThe Billing customer portal is a Stripe-hosted UI for subscription and billing management.\n\nA portal configuration describes the functionality and features that you want to provide to your customers through the portal.\n\nA portal session describes the instantiation of the customer portal for a particular customer. By visiting the session’s URL, the customer can manage their subscriptions and billing details. For security reasons, sessions are short-lived and will expire if the customer does not visit the URL. Create sessions on-demand when customers intend to manage their subscriptions and billing details.\n\nRelated guide: [Customer management](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management)\n\n## [Invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices)\n\nInvoices are statements of amounts owed by a customer, and are either generated one-off, or generated periodically from a subscription.\n\nThey contain [invoice items](#invoiceitems), and proration adjustments that may be caused by subscription upgrades/downgrades (if necessary).\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed through automatic charges, Stripe automatically finalizes your invoice and attempts payment. Note that finalizing the invoice, [when automatic](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/automatic-advancement-collection), does not happen immediately as the invoice is created. Stripe waits until one hour after the last webhook was successfully sent (or the last webhook timed out after failing). If you (and the platforms you may have connected to) have no webhooks configured, Stripe waits one hour after creation to finalize the invoice.\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed by sending an email, then based on your [email settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/billing/automatic), Stripe will email the invoice to your customer and await payment. These emails can contain a link to a hosted page to pay the invoice.\n\nStripe applies any customer credit on the account before determining the amount due for the invoice (i.e., the amount that will be actually charged). If the amount due for the invoice is less than Stripe’s [minimum allowed charge per currency](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts), the invoice is automatically marked paid, and we add the amount due to the customer’s credit balance which is applied to the next invoice.\n\nMore details on the customer’s credit balance are [here](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/customer/balance).\n\nRelated guide: [Send invoices to customers](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/invoices/sending)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create)[POST/v1/invoices/create\\_preview](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create_preview)[POST/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/lines/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_line)[GET/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/retrieve)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming)[GET/v1/invoices/:id/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming_invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/list)[DELETE/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/delete)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/add\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/add_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/remove\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/remove_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/update\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/finalize](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/finalize)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/mark\\_uncollectible](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/mark_uncollectible)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/pay](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/pay)[GET/v1/invoices/search](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/search)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/send](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/send)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/void](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/void)\n\n## [Meter Events](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event)\n\nA billing meter event represents a customer’s usage of a product. Meter events are used to bill a customer based on their usage. Meter events are associated with billing meters, which define the shape of the event’s payload and how those events are aggregated for billing.\n\n## [Meter Event Adjustment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_adjustment)\n\nA billing meter event adjustment is a resource that allows you to cancel a meter event. For example, you might create a billing meter event adjustment to cancel a meter event that was created in error or attached to the wrong customer.\n\n## [Meter Event Summary](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_summary)\n\nA billing meter event summary represents an aggregated view of a customer’s billing meter events within a specified timeframe. It indicates how much usage was accrued by a customer for that period.\n\n## [Plans](https://docs.stripe.com/api/plans)\n\nYou can now model subscriptions more flexibly using the [Prices API](#prices). It replaces the Plans API and is backwards compatible to simplify your migration.\n\nPlans define the base price, currency, and billing cycle for recurring purchases of products. [Products](#products) help you track inventory or provisioning, and plans help you track pricing. Different physical goods or levels of service should be represented by products, and pricing options should be represented by plans. This approach lets you change prices without having to change your provisioning scheme.\n\nFor example, you might have a single “gold” product that has plans for $10/month, $100/year, €9/month, and €90/year.\n\nRelated guides: [Set up a subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/set-up-subscription) and more about [products and prices](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/overview).\n\n## [Tax IDs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_create)[POST/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/create)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_retrieve)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/retrieve)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_list)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/list)[DELETE/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_delete)[DELETE/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/delete)\n\n## [Account Links](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_links)\n\nAccount Links are the means by which a Connect platform grants a connected account permission to access Stripe-hosted applications, such as Connect Onboarding.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect Onboarding](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom/hosted-onboarding)\n\n## [Account Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_sessions)\n\nAn AccountSession allows a Connect platform to grant access to a connected account in Connect embedded components.\n\nWe recommend that you create an AccountSession each time you need to display an embedded component to your user. Do not save AccountSessions to your database as they expire relatively quickly, and cannot be used more than once.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect embedded components](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-connect-embedded-components)\n\n## [Application Fees](https://docs.stripe.com/api/application_fees)\n\nWhen you collect a transaction fee on top of a charge made for your user (using [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)), an `Application Fee` object is created in your account. You can list, retrieve, and refund application fees.\n\nRelated guide: [Collecting application fees](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges#collect-fees)\n\n## [Country Specs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/country_specs)\n\nStripe needs to collect certain pieces of information about each account created. These requirements can differ depending on the account’s country. The Country Specs API makes these rules available to your integration.\n\nYou can also view the information from this API call as [an online guide](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information).\n\n## [Person](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/create)[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/update)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/retrieve)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/list)[DELETE/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/delete)\n\n## [Transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/transfers)\n\nA `Transfer` object is created when you move funds between Stripe accounts as part of Connect.\n\nBefore April 6, 2017, transfers also represented movement of funds from a Stripe account to a card or bank account. This behavior has since been split out into a [Payout](#payout_object) object, with corresponding payout endpoints. For more information, read about the [transfer/payout split](https://docs.stripe.com/transfer-payout-split).\n\nRelated guide: [Creating separate charges and transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n\n## [Secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/secret_management)\n\nSecret Store is an API that allows Stripe Apps developers to securely persist secrets for use by UI Extensions and app backends.\n\nThe primary resource in Secret Store is a `secret`. Other apps can’t view secrets created by an app. Additionally, secrets are scoped to provide further permission control.\n\nAll Dashboard users and the app backend share `account` scoped secrets. Use the `account` scope for secrets that don’t change per-user, like a third-party API key.\n\nA `user` scoped secret is accessible by the app backend and one specific Dashboard user. Use the `user` scope for per-user secrets like per-user OAuth tokens, where different users might have different permissions.\n\nRelated guide: [Store data between page reloads](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/store-auth-data-custom-objects)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[GET/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/list)[POST/v1/apps/secrets/delete](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/delete)[GET/v1/apps/secrets/find](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/find)[POST/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/set)\n\n## [Reviews](https://docs.stripe.com/api/radar/reviews)\n\nReviews can be used to supplement automated fraud detection with human expertise.\n\nLearn more about [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar) and reviewing payments [here](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/reviews).\n\n## [Authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/update)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/list)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/approve](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/approve)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/decline](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/decline)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_create)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/capture](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_capture)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/expire](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_expire)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/finalize\\_amount](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_finalize_amount)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/increment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_increment)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/fraud\\_challenges/respond](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/respond_to_fraud_challenges)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/reverse](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_reverse)\n\n## [Cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/create)[POST/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/update)[GET/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/list)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/deliver](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_deliver)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/fail](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_fail)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/return](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_return)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/ship](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_ship)\n\n## [Physical Bundles](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/physical_bundles)\n\nA Physical Bundle represents the bundle of physical items - card stock, carrier letter, and envelope - that is shipped to a cardholder when you create a physical card.\n\n## [Reader](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/terminal/readers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/create)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/update)[GET/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/retrieve)[GET/v1/terminal/readers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/list)[DELETE/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/delete)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/cancel\\_action](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/cancel_action)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/collect\\_inputs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/collect_inputs)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/confirm\\_payment\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/confirm_payment_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/collect\\_payment\\_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/collect_payment_method)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/process\\_payment\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/process_payment_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/process\\_setup\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/process_setup_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/refund\\_payment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/refund_payment)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/set\\_reader\\_display](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/set_reader_display)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/terminal/readers/:id/present\\_payment\\_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/present_payment_method)\n\n## [Terminal Hardware Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_products)Preview feature\n\nA TerminalHardwareProduct is a category of hardware devices that are generally similar, but may have variations depending on the country it’s shipped to.\n\nTerminalHardwareSKUs represent variations within the same Product (for example, a country specific device). For example, WisePOS E is a TerminalHardwareProduct and a WisePOS E - US and WisePOS E - UK are TerminalHardwareSKUs.\n\n## [Terminal Hardware SKU](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_skus)Preview feature\n\nA TerminalHardwareSKU represents a SKU for Terminal hardware. A SKU is a representation of a product available for purchase, containing information such as the name, price, and images.\n\n## [Transaction Entries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/transaction_entries)\n\nTransactionEntries represent individual units of money movements within a single [Transaction](#transactions).\n\n## [Scheduled Queries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/sigma/scheduled_queries)\n\nIf you have [scheduled a Sigma query](https://docs.stripe.com/sigma/scheduled-queries), you’ll receive a `sigma.scheduled_query_run.created` webhook each time the query runs. The webhook contains a `ScheduledQueryRun` object, which you can use to retrieve the query results.\n\n## [Report Types](https://docs.stripe.com/api/reporting/report_type)\n\nThe Report Type resource corresponds to a particular type of report, such as the “Activity summary” or “Itemized payouts” reports. These objects are identified by an ID belonging to a set of enumerated values. See [API Access to Reports documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/reporting/statements/api) for those Report Type IDs, along with required and optional parameters.\n\nNote that certain report types can only be run based on your live-mode data (not test-mode data), and will error when queried without a [live-mode API key](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#test-live-modes).\n\n## [Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/financial_connections/sessions)\n\nA Financial Connections Session is the secure way to programmatically launch the client-side Stripe.js modal that lets your users link their accounts.\n\n## [Verification Report](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_reports)\n\nA VerificationReport is the result of an attempt to collect and verify data from a user. The collection of verification checks performed is determined from the `type` and `options` parameters used. You can find the result of each verification check performed in the appropriate sub-resource: `document`, `id_number`, `selfie`.\n\nEach VerificationReport contains a copy of any data collected by the user as well as reference IDs which can be used to access collected images through the [FileUpload](https://docs.stripe.com/api/files) API. To configure and create VerificationReports, use the [VerificationSession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_sessions) API.\n\nRelated guide: [Accessing verification results](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verification-sessions#results).\n\n## [Crypto Onramp Quotes](https://docs.stripe.com/api/crypto/onramp_quotes)\n\nCrypto Onramp Quotes are estimated quotes for onramp conversions into all the different cryptocurrencies on different networks. The Quotes API allows you to display quotes in your product UI before directing the user to the onramp widget.\n\nRelated guide: [Quotes API](https://docs.stripe.com/crypto/quotes-api)\n\n## [Climate Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/climate/product)\n\nA Climate product represents a type of carbon removal unit available for reservation. You can retrieve it to see the current price and availability.\n\n## [Forwarding Request](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/request)\n\nInstructs Stripe to make a request on your behalf using the destination URL. The destination URL is activated by Stripe at the time of onboarding. Stripe verifies requests with your credentials provided during onboarding, and injects card details from the payment\\_method into the request.\n\nStripe redacts all sensitive fields and headers, including authentication credentials and card numbers, before storing the request and response data in the forwarding Request object, which are subject to a 30-day retention period.\n\nYou can provide a Stripe idempotency key to make sure that requests with the same key result in only one outbound request. The Stripe idempotency key provided should be unique and different from any idempotency keys provided on the underlying third-party request.\n\nForwarding Requests are synchronous requests that return a response or time out according to Stripe’s limits.\n\nRelated guide: [Forward card details to third-party API endpoints](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/forwarding).\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/create)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/retrieve)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/list)",

These approaches will perform any necessary steps to set up the PaymentMethod for future payments. Using the `/v1/payment_methods/:id/attach` endpoint without first using a SetupIntent or PaymentIntent with `setup_future_usage` does not optimize the PaymentMethod for future use, which makes later declines and payment friction more likely. See [Optimizing cards for future payments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents#future-usage) for more information about setting up future payments.\n\nTo use this PaymentMethod as the default for invoice or subscription payments, set [`invoice_settings.default_payment_method`](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/update#update_customer-invoice_settings-default_payment_method), on the Customer to the PaymentMethod’s ID.\n\n### Parameters\n\n*   The ID of the customer to which to attach the PaymentMethod.\n    \n\n### Returns\n\nReturns a PaymentMethod object.\n\nPOST /v1/payment\\_methods/:id/attach\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/payment_methods/pm_1MqM05LkdIwHu7ixlDxxO6Mc/attach \\  -u \"sk_test_4eC39Hq...arjtT1zdp7dcsk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc:\" \\  -d customer=cus_NbZ8Ki3f322LNn\n```\n\n```\n{  \"id\": \"pm_1MqM05LkdIwHu7ixlDxxO6Mc\",  \"object\": \"payment_method\",  \"billing_details\": {    \"address\": {      \"city\": null,      \"country\": null,      \"line1\": null,      \"line2\": null,      \"postal_code\": null,      \"state\": null    },    \"email\": null,    \"name\": null,    \"phone\": null  },  \"card\": {    \"brand\": \"visa\",    \"checks\": {      \"address_line1_check\": null,      \"address_postal_code_check\": null,      \"cvc_check\": \"pass\"    },    \"country\": \"US\",    \"exp_month\": 8,    \"exp_year\": 2026,    \"fingerprint\": \"mToisGZ01V71BCos\",    \"funding\": \"credit\",    \"generated_from\": null,    \"last4\": \"4242\",    \"networks\": {      \"available\": [        \"visa\"      ],      \"preferred\": null    },    \"three_d_secure_usage\": {      \"supported\": true    },    \"wallet\": null  },  \"created\": 1679946402,  \"customer\": \"cus_NbZ8Ki3f322LNn\",  \"livemode\": false,  \"metadata\": {},  \"type\": \"card\"}\n```\n\n## [Detach a PaymentMethod from a Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods/detach)\n\nDetaches a PaymentMethod object from a Customer. After a PaymentMethod is detached, it can no longer be used for a payment or re-attached to a Customer.\n\n### Parameters\n\nNo parameters.\n\n### Returns\n\nReturns a PaymentMethod object.\n\nPOST /v1/payment\\_methods/:id/detach\n\n```\ncurl -X POST https://api.stripe.com/v1/payment_methods/pm_1MqLiJLkdIwHu7ixUEgbFdYF/detach \\  -u \"sk_test_4eC39Hq...arjtT1zdp7dcsk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc:\"\n```\n\n```\n{  \"id\": \"pm_1MqLiJLkdIwHu7ixUEgbFdYF\",  \"object\": \"payment_method\",  \"billing_details\": {    \"address\": {      \"city\": null,      \"country\": null,      \"line1\": null,      \"line2\": null,      \"postal_code\": null,      \"state\": null    },    \"email\": null,    \"name\": null,    \"phone\": null  },  \"card\": {    \"brand\": \"visa\",    \"checks\": {      \"address_line1_check\": null,      \"address_postal_code_check\": null,      \"cvc_check\": \"unchecked\"    },    \"country\": \"US\",    \"exp_month\": 8,    \"exp_year\": 2026,    \"fingerprint\": \"mToisGZ01V71BCos\",    \"funding\": \"credit\",    \"generated_from\": null,    \"last4\": \"4242\",    \"networks\": {      \"available\": [        \"visa\"      ],      \"preferred\": null    },    \"three_d_secure_usage\": {      \"supported\": true    },    \"wallet\": null  },  \"created\": 1679945299,  \"customer\": null,  \"livemode\": false,  \"metadata\": {},  \"type\": \"card\"}\n```\n\n## [Cash Balance](https://docs.stripe.com/api/cash_balance)\n\nA customer’s `Cash balance` represents real funds. Customers can add funds to their cash balance by sending a bank transfer. These funds can be used for payment and can eventually be paid out to your bank account.\n\n## [Customer Portal Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customer_portal/sessions)\n\nThe Billing customer portal is a Stripe-hosted UI for subscription and billing management.\n\nA portal configuration describes the functionality and features that you want to provide to your customers through the portal.\n\nA portal session describes the instantiation of the customer portal for a particular customer. By visiting the session’s URL, the customer can manage their subscriptions and billing details. For security reasons, sessions are short-lived and will expire if the customer does not visit the URL. Create sessions on-demand when customers intend to manage their subscriptions and billing details.\n\nRelated guide: [Customer management](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management)\n\n## [Invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices)\n\nInvoices are statements of amounts owed by a customer, and are either generated one-off, or generated periodically from a subscription.\n\nThey contain [invoice items](#invoiceitems), and proration adjustments that may be caused by subscription upgrades/downgrades (if necessary).\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed through automatic charges, Stripe automatically finalizes your invoice and attempts payment. Note that finalizing the invoice, [when automatic](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/automatic-advancement-collection), does not happen immediately as the invoice is created. Stripe waits until one hour after the last webhook was successfully sent (or the last webhook timed out after failing). If you (and the platforms you may have connected to) have no webhooks configured, Stripe waits one hour after creation to finalize the invoice.\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed by sending an email, then based on your [email settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/billing/automatic), Stripe will email the invoice to your customer and await payment. These emails can contain a link to a hosted page to pay the invoice.\n\nStripe applies any customer credit on the account before determining the amount due for the invoice (i.e., the amount that will be actually charged). If the amount due for the invoice is less than Stripe’s [minimum allowed charge per currency](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts), the invoice is automatically marked paid, and we add the amount due to the customer’s credit balance which is applied to the next invoice.\n\nMore details on the customer’s credit balance are [here](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/customer/balance).\n\nRelated guide: [Send invoices to customers](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/invoices/sending)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create)[POST/v1/invoices/create\\_preview](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create_preview)[POST/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/lines/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_line)[GET/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/retrieve)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming)[GET/v1/invoices/:id/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming_invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/list)[DELETE/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/delete)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/add\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/add_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/remove\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/remove_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/update\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/finalize](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/finalize)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/mark\\_uncollectible](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/mark_uncollectible)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/pay](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/pay)[GET/v1/invoices/search](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/search)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/send](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/send)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/void](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/void)\n\n## [Meter Events](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event)\n\nA billing meter event represents a customer’s usage of a product. Meter events are used to bill a customer based on their usage. Meter events are associated with billing meters, which define the shape of the event’s payload and how those events are aggregated for billing.\n\n## [Meter Event Adjustment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_adjustment)\n\nA billing meter event adjustment is a resource that allows you to cancel a meter event. For example, you might create a billing meter event adjustment to cancel a meter event that was created in error or attached to the wrong customer.\n\n## [Meter Event Summary](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_summary)\n\nA billing meter event summary represents an aggregated view of a customer’s billing meter events within a specified timeframe. It indicates how much usage was accrued by a customer for that period.\n\n## [Plans](https://docs.stripe.com/api/plans)\n\nYou can now model subscriptions more flexibly using the [Prices API](#prices). It replaces the Plans API and is backwards compatible to simplify your migration.\n\nPlans define the base price, currency, and billing cycle for recurring purchases of products. [Products](#products) help you track inventory or provisioning, and plans help you track pricing. Different physical goods or levels of service should be represented by products, and pricing options should be represented by plans. This approach lets you change prices without having to change your provisioning scheme.\n\nFor example, you might have a single “gold” product that has plans for $10/month, $100/year, €9/month, and €90/year.\n\nRelated guides: [Set up a subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/set-up-subscription) and more about [products and prices](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/overview).\n\n## [Tax IDs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_create)[POST/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/create)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_retrieve)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/retrieve)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_list)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/list)[DELETE/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_delete)[DELETE/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/delete)\n\n## [Account Links](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_links)\n\nAccount Links are the means by which a Connect platform grants a connected account permission to access Stripe-hosted applications, such as Connect Onboarding.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect Onboarding](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom/hosted-onboarding)\n\n## [Account Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_sessions)\n\nAn AccountSession allows a Connect platform to grant access to a connected account in Connect embedded components.\n\nWe recommend that you create an AccountSession each time you need to display an embedded component to your user. Do not save AccountSessions to your database as they expire relatively quickly, and cannot be used more than once.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect embedded components](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-connect-embedded-components)\n\n## [Application Fees](https://docs.stripe.com/api/application_fees)\n\nWhen you collect a transaction fee on top of a charge made for your user (using [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)), an `Application Fee` object is created in your account. You can list, retrieve, and refund application fees.\n\nRelated guide: [Collecting application fees](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges#collect-fees)\n\n## [Country Specs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/country_specs)\n\nStripe needs to collect certain pieces of information about each account created. These requirements can differ depending on the account’s country. The Country Specs API makes these rules available to your integration.\n\nYou can also view the information from this API call as [an online guide](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information).\n\n## [Person](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/create)[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/update)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/retrieve)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/list)[DELETE/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/delete)\n\n## [Transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/transfers)\n\nA `Transfer` object is created when you move funds between Stripe accounts as part of Connect.\n\nBefore April 6, 2017, transfers also represented movement of funds from a Stripe account to a card or bank account. This behavior has since been split out into a [Payout](#payout_object) object, with corresponding payout endpoints. For more information, read about the [transfer/payout split](https://docs.stripe.com/transfer-payout-split).\n\nRelated guide: [Creating separate charges and transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n\n## [Secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/secret_management)\n\nSecret Store is an API that allows Stripe Apps developers to securely persist secrets for use by UI Extensions and app backends.\n\nThe primary resource in Secret Store is a `secret`. Other apps can’t view secrets created by an app. Additionally, secrets are scoped to provide further permission control.\n\nAll Dashboard users and the app backend share `account` scoped secrets. Use the `account` scope for secrets that don’t change per-user, like a third-party API key.\n\nA `user` scoped secret is accessible by the app backend and one specific Dashboard user. Use the `user` scope for per-user secrets like per-user OAuth tokens, where different users might have different permissions.\n\nRelated guide: [Store data between page reloads](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/store-auth-data-custom-objects)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[GET/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/list)[POST/v1/apps/secrets/delete](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/delete)[GET/v1/apps/secrets/find](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/find)[POST/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/set)\n\n## [Reviews](https://docs.stripe.com/api/radar/reviews)\n\nReviews can be used to supplement automated fraud detection with human expertise.\n\nLearn more about [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar) and reviewing payments [here](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/reviews).\n\n## [Authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/update)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/list)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/approve](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/approve)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/decline](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/decline)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_create)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/capture](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_capture)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/expire](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_expire)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/finalize\\_amount](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_finalize_amount)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/increment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_increment)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/fraud\\_challenges/respond](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/respond_to_fraud_challenges)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/reverse](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_reverse)\n\n## [Cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/create)[POST/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/update)[GET/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/list)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/deliver](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_deliver)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/fail](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_fail)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/return](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_return)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/ship](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_ship)\n\n## [Physical Bundles](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/physical_bundles)\n\nA Physical Bundle represents the bundle of physical items - card stock, carrier letter, and envelope - that is shipped to a cardholder when you create a physical card.\n\n## [Reader](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/terminal/readers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/create)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/update)[GET/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/retrieve)[GET/v1/terminal/readers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/list)[DELETE/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/delete)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/cancel\\_action](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/cancel_action)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/collect\\_inputs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/collect_inputs)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/confirm\\_payment\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/confirm_payment_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/collect\\_payment\\_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/collect_payment_method)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/process\\_payment\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/process_payment_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/process\\_setup\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/process_setup_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/refund\\_payment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/refund_payment)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/set\\_reader\\_display](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/set_reader_display)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/terminal/readers/:id/present\\_payment\\_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/present_payment_method)\n\n## [Terminal Hardware Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_products)Preview feature\n\nA TerminalHardwareProduct is a category of hardware devices that are generally similar, but may have variations depending on the country it’s shipped to.\n\nTerminalHardwareSKUs represent variations within the same Product (for example, a country specific device). For example, WisePOS E is a TerminalHardwareProduct and a WisePOS E - US and WisePOS E - UK are TerminalHardwareSKUs.\n\n## [Terminal Hardware SKU](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_skus)Preview feature\n\nA TerminalHardwareSKU represents a SKU for Terminal hardware. A SKU is a representation of a product available for purchase, containing information such as the name, price, and images.\n\n## [Transaction Entries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/transaction_entries)\n\nTransactionEntries represent individual units of money movements within a single [Transaction](#transactions).\n\n## [Scheduled Queries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/sigma/scheduled_queries)\n\nIf you have [scheduled a Sigma query](https://docs.stripe.com/sigma/scheduled-queries), you’ll receive a `sigma.scheduled_query_run.created` webhook each time the query runs. The webhook contains a `ScheduledQueryRun` object, which you can use to retrieve the query results.\n\n## [Report Types](https://docs.stripe.com/api/reporting/report_type)\n\nThe Report Type resource corresponds to a particular type of report, such as the “Activity summary” or “Itemized payouts” reports. These objects are identified by an ID belonging to a set of enumerated values. See [API Access to Reports documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/reporting/statements/api) for those Report Type IDs, along with required and optional parameters.\n\nNote that certain report types can only be run based on your live-mode data (not test-mode data), and will error when queried without a [live-mode API key](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#test-live-modes).\n\n## [Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/financial_connections/sessions)\n\nA Financial Connections Session is the secure way to programmatically launch the client-side Stripe.js modal that lets your users link their accounts.\n\n## [Verification Report](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_reports)\n\nA VerificationReport is the result of an attempt to collect and verify data from a user. The collection of verification checks performed is determined from the `type` and `options` parameters used. You can find the result of each verification check performed in the appropriate sub-resource: `document`, `id_number`, `selfie`.\n\nEach VerificationReport contains a copy of any data collected by the user as well as reference IDs which can be used to access collected images through the [FileUpload](https://docs.stripe.com/api/files) API. To configure and create VerificationReports, use the [VerificationSession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_sessions) API.\n\nRelated guide: [Accessing verification results](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verification-sessions#results).\n\n## [Crypto Onramp Quotes](https://docs.stripe.com/api/crypto/onramp_quotes)\n\nCrypto Onramp Quotes are estimated quotes for onramp conversions into all the different cryptocurrencies on different networks. The Quotes API allows you to display quotes in your product UI before directing the user to the onramp widget.\n\nRelated guide: [Quotes API](https://docs.stripe.com/crypto/quotes-api)\n\n## [Climate Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/climate/product)\n\nA Climate product represents a type of carbon removal unit available for reservation. You can retrieve it to see the current price and availability.\n\n## [Forwarding Request](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/request)\n\nInstructs Stripe to make a request on your behalf using the destination URL. The destination URL is activated by Stripe at the time of onboarding. Stripe verifies requests with your credentials provided during onboarding, and injects card details from the payment\\_method into the request.\n\nStripe redacts all sensitive fields and headers, including authentication credentials and card numbers, before storing the request and response data in the forwarding Request object, which are subject to a 30-day retention period.\n\nYou can provide a Stripe idempotency key to make sure that requests with the same key result in only one outbound request. The Stripe idempotency key provided should be unique and different from any idempotency keys provided on the underlying third-party request.\n\nForwarding Requests are synchronous requests that return a response or time out according to Stripe’s limits.\n\nRelated guide: [Forward card details to third-party API endpoints](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/forwarding).\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/create)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/retrieve)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/list)",

You can use SetupAttempts to inspect details of a specific attempt at setting up a payment method using a SetupIntent.\n\n## [Confirmation Token](https://docs.stripe.com/api/confirmation_tokens)\n\nConfirmationTokens help transport client side data collected by Stripe JS over to your server for confirming a PaymentIntent or SetupIntent. If the confirmation is successful, values present on the ConfirmationToken are written onto the Intent.\n\nTo learn more about how to use ConfirmationToken, visit the related guides:\n\n*   [Finalize payments on the server](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/finalize-payments-on-the-server)\n*   [Build two-step confirmation](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/build-a-two-step-confirmation).\n\n## [Tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens)\n\nTokenization is the process Stripe uses to collect sensitive card or bank account details, or personally identifiable information (PII), directly from your customers in a secure manner. A token representing this information is returned to your server to use. Use our [recommended payments integrations](https://docs.stripe.com/payments) to perform this process on the client-side. This guarantees that no sensitive card data touches your server, and allows your integration to operate in a PCI-compliant way.\n\nIf you can’t use client-side tokenization, you can also create tokens using the API with either your publishable or secret API key. If your integration uses this method, you’re responsible for any PCI compliance that it might require, and you must keep your secret API key safe. Unlike with client-side tokenization, your customer’s information isn’t sent directly to Stripe, so we can’t determine how it’s handled or stored.\n\nYou can’t store or use tokens more than once. To store card or bank account information for later use, create [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api#customers) objects or [External accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/api#external_accounts). [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar), our integrated solution for automatic fraud protection, performs best with integrations that use client-side tokenization.\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_account)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_bank_account)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_card)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_cvc_update)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_person)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_pii)[GET/v1/tokens/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/retrieve)\n\n## [Cash Balance](https://docs.stripe.com/api/cash_balance)\n\nA customer’s `Cash balance` represents real funds. Customers can add funds to their cash balance by sending a bank transfer. These funds can be used for payment and can eventually be paid out to your bank account.\n\n## [Customer Portal Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customer_portal/sessions)\n\nThe Billing customer portal is a Stripe-hosted UI for subscription and billing management.\n\nA portal configuration describes the functionality and features that you want to provide to your customers through the portal.\n\nA portal session describes the instantiation of the customer portal for a particular customer. By visiting the session’s URL, the customer can manage their subscriptions and billing details. For security reasons, sessions are short-lived and will expire if the customer does not visit the URL. Create sessions on-demand when customers intend to manage their subscriptions and billing details.\n\nRelated guide: [Customer management](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management)\n\n## [Invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices)\n\nInvoices are statements of amounts owed by a customer, and are either generated one-off, or generated periodically from a subscription.\n\nThey contain [invoice items](#invoiceitems), and proration adjustments that may be caused by subscription upgrades/downgrades (if necessary).\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed through automatic charges, Stripe automatically finalizes your invoice and attempts payment. Note that finalizing the invoice, [when automatic](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/automatic-advancement-collection), does not happen immediately as the invoice is created. Stripe waits until one hour after the last webhook was successfully sent (or the last webhook timed out after failing). If you (and the platforms you may have connected to) have no webhooks configured, Stripe waits one hour after creation to finalize the invoice.\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed by sending an email, then based on your [email settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/billing/automatic), Stripe will email the invoice to your customer and await payment. These emails can contain a link to a hosted page to pay the invoice.\n\nStripe applies any customer credit on the account before determining the amount due for the invoice (i.e., the amount that will be actually charged). If the amount due for the invoice is less than Stripe’s [minimum allowed charge per currency](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts), the invoice is automatically marked paid, and we add the amount due to the customer’s credit balance which is applied to the next invoice.\n\nMore details on the customer’s credit balance are [here](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/customer/balance).\n\nRelated guide: [Send invoices to customers](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/invoices/sending)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create)[POST/v1/invoices/create\\_preview](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create_preview)[POST/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/lines/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_line)[GET/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/retrieve)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming)[GET/v1/invoices/:id/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming_invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/list)[DELETE/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/delete)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/add\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/add_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/remove\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/remove_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/update\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/finalize](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/finalize)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/mark\\_uncollectible](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/mark_uncollectible)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/pay](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/pay)[GET/v1/invoices/search](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/search)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/send](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/send)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/void](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/void)\n\n## [Meter Events](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event)\n\nA billing meter event represents a customer’s usage of a product. Meter events are used to bill a customer based on their usage. Meter events are associated with billing meters, which define the shape of the event’s payload and how those events are aggregated for billing.\n\n## [Meter Event Adjustment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_adjustment)\n\nA billing meter event adjustment is a resource that allows you to cancel a meter event. For example, you might create a billing meter event adjustment to cancel a meter event that was created in error or attached to the wrong customer.\n\n## [Meter Event Summary](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_summary)\n\nA billing meter event summary represents an aggregated view of a customer’s billing meter events within a specified timeframe. It indicates how much usage was accrued by a customer for that period.\n\n## [Plans](https://docs.stripe.com/api/plans)\n\nYou can now model subscriptions more flexibly using the [Prices API](#prices). It replaces the Plans API and is backwards compatible to simplify your migration.\n\nPlans define the base price, currency, and billing cycle for recurring purchases of products. [Products](#products) help you track inventory or provisioning, and plans help you track pricing. Different physical goods or levels of service should be represented by products, and pricing options should be represented by plans. This approach lets you change prices without having to change your provisioning scheme.\n\nFor example, you might have a single “gold” product that has plans for $10/month, $100/year, €9/month, and €90/year.\n\nRelated guides: [Set up a subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/set-up-subscription) and more about [products and prices](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/overview).\n\n## [Tax IDs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_create)[POST/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/create)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_retrieve)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/retrieve)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_list)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/list)[DELETE/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_delete)[DELETE/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/delete)\n\n## [Account Links](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_links)\n\nAccount Links are the means by which a Connect platform grants a connected account permission to access Stripe-hosted applications, such as Connect Onboarding.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect Onboarding](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom/hosted-onboarding)\n\n## [Account Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_sessions)\n\nAn AccountSession allows a Connect platform to grant access to a connected account in Connect embedded components.\n\nWe recommend that you create an AccountSession each time you need to display an embedded component to your user. Do not save AccountSessions to your database as they expire relatively quickly, and cannot be used more than once.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect embedded components](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-connect-embedded-components)\n\n## [Application Fees](https://docs.stripe.com/api/application_fees)\n\nWhen you collect a transaction fee on top of a charge made for your user (using [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)), an `Application Fee` object is created in your account. You can list, retrieve, and refund application fees.\n\nRelated guide: [Collecting application fees](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges#collect-fees)\n\n## [Country Specs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/country_specs)\n\nStripe needs to collect certain pieces of information about each account created. These requirements can differ depending on the account’s country. The Country Specs API makes these rules available to your integration.\n\nYou can also view the information from this API call as [an online guide](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information).\n\n## [Person](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/create)[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/update)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/retrieve)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/list)[DELETE/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/delete)\n\n## [Transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/transfers)\n\nA `Transfer` object is created when you move funds between Stripe accounts as part of Connect.\n\nBefore April 6, 2017, transfers also represented movement of funds from a Stripe account to a card or bank account. This behavior has since been split out into a [Payout](#payout_object) object, with corresponding payout endpoints. For more information, read about the [transfer/payout split](https://docs.stripe.com/transfer-payout-split).\n\nRelated guide: [Creating separate charges and transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n\n## [Secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/secret_management)\n\nSecret Store is an API that allows Stripe Apps developers to securely persist secrets for use by UI Extensions and app backends.\n\nThe primary resource in Secret Store is a `secret`. Other apps can’t view secrets created by an app. Additionally, secrets are scoped to provide further permission control.\n\nAll Dashboard users and the app backend share `account` scoped secrets. Use the `account` scope for secrets that don’t change per-user, like a third-party API key.\n\nA `user` scoped secret is accessible by the app backend and one specific Dashboard user. Use the `user` scope for per-user secrets like per-user OAuth tokens, where different users might have different permissions.\n\nRelated guide: [Store data between page reloads](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/store-auth-data-custom-objects)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[GET/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/list)[POST/v1/apps/secrets/delete](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/delete)[GET/v1/apps/secrets/find](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/find)[POST/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/set)\n\n## [Reviews](https://docs.stripe.com/api/radar/reviews)\n\nReviews can be used to supplement automated fraud detection with human expertise.\n\nLearn more about [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar) and reviewing payments [here](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/reviews).\n\n## [Authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/update)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/list)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/approve](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/approve)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/decline](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/decline)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_create)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/capture](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_capture)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/expire](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_expire)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/finalize\\_amount](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_finalize_amount)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/increment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_increment)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/fraud\\_challenges/respond](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/respond_to_fraud_challenges)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/reverse](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_reverse)\n\n## [Cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/create)[POST/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/update)[GET/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/list)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/deliver](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_deliver)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/fail](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_fail)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/return](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_return)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/ship](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_ship)\n\n## [Physical Bundles](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/physical_bundles)\n\nA Physical Bundle represents the bundle of physical items - card stock, carrier letter, and envelope - that is shipped to a cardholder when you create a physical card.\n\n## [Reader](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/terminal/readers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/create)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/update)[GET/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/retrieve)[GET/v1/terminal/readers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/list)[DELETE/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/delete)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/cancel\\_action](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/cancel_action)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/collect\\_inputs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/collect_inputs)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/confirm\\_payment\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/confirm_payment_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/collect\\_payment\\_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/collect_payment_method)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/process\\_payment\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/process_payment_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/process\\_setup\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/process_setup_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/refund\\_payment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/refund_payment)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/set\\_reader\\_display](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/set_reader_display)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/terminal/readers/:id/present\\_payment\\_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/present_payment_method)\n\n## [Terminal Hardware Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_products)Preview feature\n\nA TerminalHardwareProduct is a category of hardware devices that are generally similar, but may have variations depending on the country it’s shipped to.\n\nTerminalHardwareSKUs represent variations within the same Product (for example, a country specific device). For example, WisePOS E is a TerminalHardwareProduct and a WisePOS E - US and WisePOS E - UK are TerminalHardwareSKUs.\n\n## [Terminal Hardware SKU](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_skus)Preview feature\n\nA TerminalHardwareSKU represents a SKU for Terminal hardware. A SKU is a representation of a product available for purchase, containing information such as the name, price, and images.\n\n## [Transaction Entries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/transaction_entries)\n\nTransactionEntries represent individual units of money movements within a single [Transaction](#transactions).\n\n## [Scheduled Queries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/sigma/scheduled_queries)\n\nIf you have [scheduled a Sigma query](https://docs.stripe.com/sigma/scheduled-queries), you’ll receive a `sigma.scheduled_query_run.created` webhook each time the query runs. The webhook contains a `ScheduledQueryRun` object, which you can use to retrieve the query results.\n\n## [Report Types](https://docs.stripe.com/api/reporting/report_type)\n\nThe Report Type resource corresponds to a particular type of report, such as the “Activity summary” or “Itemized payouts” reports. These objects are identified by an ID belonging to a set of enumerated values. See [API Access to Reports documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/reporting/statements/api) for those Report Type IDs, along with required and optional parameters.\n\nNote that certain report types can only be run based on your live-mode data (not test-mode data), and will error when queried without a [live-mode API key](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#test-live-modes).\n\n## [Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/financial_connections/sessions)\n\nA Financial Connections Session is the secure way to programmatically launch the client-side Stripe.js modal that lets your users link their accounts.\n\n## [Verification Report](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_reports)\n\nA VerificationReport is the result of an attempt to collect and verify data from a user. The collection of verification checks performed is determined from the `type` and `options` parameters used. You can find the result of each verification check performed in the appropriate sub-resource: `document`, `id_number`, `selfie`.\n\nEach VerificationReport contains a copy of any data collected by the user as well as reference IDs which can be used to access collected images through the [FileUpload](https://docs.stripe.com/api/files) API. To configure and create VerificationReports, use the [VerificationSession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_sessions) API.\n\nRelated guide: [Accessing verification results](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verification-sessions#results).\n\n## [Crypto Onramp Quotes](https://docs.stripe.com/api/crypto/onramp_quotes)\n\nCrypto Onramp Quotes are estimated quotes for onramp conversions into all the different cryptocurrencies on different networks. The Quotes API allows you to display quotes in your product UI before directing the user to the onramp widget.\n\nRelated guide: [Quotes API](https://docs.stripe.com/crypto/quotes-api)\n\n## [Climate Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/climate/product)\n\nA Climate product represents a type of carbon removal unit available for reservation. You can retrieve it to see the current price and availability.\n\n## [Forwarding Request](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/request)\n\nInstructs Stripe to make a request on your behalf using the destination URL. The destination URL is activated by Stripe at the time of onboarding. Stripe verifies requests with your credentials provided during onboarding, and injects card details from the payment\\_method into the request.\n\nStripe redacts all sensitive fields and headers, including authentication credentials and card numbers, before storing the request and response data in the forwarding Request object, which are subject to a 30-day retention period.\n\nYou can provide a Stripe idempotency key to make sure that requests with the same key result in only one outbound request. The Stripe idempotency key provided should be unique and different from any idempotency keys provided on the underlying third-party request.\n\nForwarding Requests are synchronous requests that return a response or time out according to Stripe’s limits.\n\nRelated guide: [Forward card details to third-party API endpoints](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/forwarding).\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/create)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/retrieve)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/list)",

If you delete the last remaining card on a recipient, then the default\\_card attribute will become null.\n\nNote that for cards belonging to customers, you might want to prevent customers on paid subscriptions from deleting all cards on file, so that there is at least one default card for the next invoice payment attempt.\n\n### Parameters\n\nNo parameters.\n\n### Returns\n\nDELETE /v1/customers/:id/sources/:id\n\n```\ncurl -X DELETE https://api.stripe.com/v1/customers/acct_1032D82eZvKYlo2C/sources/card_1NGTaT2eZvKYlo2CZWSctn5n \\  -u \"sk_test_4eC39Hq...arjtT1zdp7dcsk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc:\"\n```\n\n```\n{  \"id\": \"card_1NGTaT2eZvKYlo2CZWSctn5n\",  \"object\": \"card\",  \"deleted\": true}\n```\n\n## [Customer Portal Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customer_portal/sessions)\n\nThe Billing customer portal is a Stripe-hosted UI for subscription and billing management.\n\nA portal configuration describes the functionality and features that you want to provide to your customers through the portal.\n\nA portal session describes the instantiation of the customer portal for a particular customer. By visiting the session’s URL, the customer can manage their subscriptions and billing details. For security reasons, sessions are short-lived and will expire if the customer does not visit the URL. Create sessions on-demand when customers intend to manage their subscriptions and billing details.\n\nRelated guide: [Customer management](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management)\n\n## [Invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices)\n\nInvoices are statements of amounts owed by a customer, and are either generated one-off, or generated periodically from a subscription.\n\nThey contain [invoice items](#invoiceitems), and proration adjustments that may be caused by subscription upgrades/downgrades (if necessary).\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed through automatic charges, Stripe automatically finalizes your invoice and attempts payment. Note that finalizing the invoice, [when automatic](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/automatic-advancement-collection), does not happen immediately as the invoice is created. Stripe waits until one hour after the last webhook was successfully sent (or the last webhook timed out after failing). If you (and the platforms you may have connected to) have no webhooks configured, Stripe waits one hour after creation to finalize the invoice.\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed by sending an email, then based on your [email settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/billing/automatic), Stripe will email the invoice to your customer and await payment. These emails can contain a link to a hosted page to pay the invoice.\n\nStripe applies any customer credit on the account before determining the amount due for the invoice (i.e., the amount that will be actually charged). If the amount due for the invoice is less than Stripe’s [minimum allowed charge per currency](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts), the invoice is automatically marked paid, and we add the amount due to the customer’s credit balance which is applied to the next invoice.\n\nMore details on the customer’s credit balance are [here](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/customer/balance).\n\nRelated guide: [Send invoices to customers](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/invoices/sending)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create)[POST/v1/invoices/create\\_preview](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create_preview)[POST/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/lines/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_line)[GET/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/retrieve)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming)[GET/v1/invoices/:id/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming_invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/list)[DELETE/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/delete)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/add\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/add_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/remove\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/remove_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/update\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/finalize](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/finalize)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/mark\\_uncollectible](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/mark_uncollectible)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/pay](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/pay)[GET/v1/invoices/search](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/search)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/send](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/send)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/void](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/void)\n\n## [Meter Events](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event)\n\nA billing meter event represents a customer’s usage of a product. Meter events are used to bill a customer based on their usage. Meter events are associated with billing meters, which define the shape of the event’s payload and how those events are aggregated for billing.\n\n## [Meter Event Adjustment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_adjustment)\n\nA billing meter event adjustment is a resource that allows you to cancel a meter event. For example, you might create a billing meter event adjustment to cancel a meter event that was created in error or attached to the wrong customer.\n\n## [Meter Event Summary](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_summary)\n\nA billing meter event summary represents an aggregated view of a customer’s billing meter events within a specified timeframe. It indicates how much usage was accrued by a customer for that period.\n\n## [Plans](https://docs.stripe.com/api/plans)\n\nYou can now model subscriptions more flexibly using the [Prices API](#prices). It replaces the Plans API and is backwards compatible to simplify your migration.\n\nPlans define the base price, currency, and billing cycle for recurring purchases of products. [Products](#products) help you track inventory or provisioning, and plans help you track pricing. Different physical goods or levels of service should be represented by products, and pricing options should be represented by plans. This approach lets you change prices without having to change your provisioning scheme.\n\nFor example, you might have a single “gold” product that has plans for $10/month, $100/year, €9/month, and €90/year.\n\nRelated guides: [Set up a subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/set-up-subscription) and more about [products and prices](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/overview).\n\n## [Tax IDs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_create)[POST/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/create)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_retrieve)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/retrieve)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_list)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/list)[DELETE/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_delete)[DELETE/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/delete)\n\n## [Account Links](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_links)\n\nAccount Links are the means by which a Connect platform grants a connected account permission to access Stripe-hosted applications, such as Connect Onboarding.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect Onboarding](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom/hosted-onboarding)\n\n## [Account Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_sessions)\n\nAn AccountSession allows a Connect platform to grant access to a connected account in Connect embedded components.\n\nWe recommend that you create an AccountSession each time you need to display an embedded component to your user. Do not save AccountSessions to your database as they expire relatively quickly, and cannot be used more than once.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect embedded components](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-connect-embedded-components)\n\n## [Application Fees](https://docs.stripe.com/api/application_fees)\n\nWhen you collect a transaction fee on top of a charge made for your user (using [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)), an `Application Fee` object is created in your account. You can list, retrieve, and refund application fees.\n\nRelated guide: [Collecting application fees](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges#collect-fees)\n\n## [Country Specs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/country_specs)\n\nStripe needs to collect certain pieces of information about each account created. These requirements can differ depending on the account’s country. The Country Specs API makes these rules available to your integration.\n\nYou can also view the information from this API call as [an online guide](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information).\n\n## [Person](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/create)[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/update)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/retrieve)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/list)[DELETE/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/delete)\n\n## [Transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/transfers)\n\nA `Transfer` object is created when you move funds between Stripe accounts as part of Connect.\n\nBefore April 6, 2017, transfers also represented movement of funds from a Stripe account to a card or bank account. This behavior has since been split out into a [Payout](#payout_object) object, with corresponding payout endpoints. For more information, read about the [transfer/payout split](https://docs.stripe.com/transfer-payout-split).\n\nRelated guide: [Creating separate charges and transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n\n## [Secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/secret_management)\n\nSecret Store is an API that allows Stripe Apps developers to securely persist secrets for use by UI Extensions and app backends.\n\nThe primary resource in Secret Store is a `secret`. Other apps can’t view secrets created by an app. Additionally, secrets are scoped to provide further permission control.\n\nAll Dashboard users and the app backend share `account` scoped secrets. Use the `account` scope for secrets that don’t change per-user, like a third-party API key.\n\nA `user` scoped secret is accessible by the app backend and one specific Dashboard user. Use the `user` scope for per-user secrets like per-user OAuth tokens, where different users might have different permissions.\n\nRelated guide: [Store data between page reloads](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/store-auth-data-custom-objects)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[GET/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/list)[POST/v1/apps/secrets/delete](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/delete)[GET/v1/apps/secrets/find](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/find)[POST/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/set)\n\n## [Reviews](https://docs.stripe.com/api/radar/reviews)\n\nReviews can be used to supplement automated fraud detection with human expertise.\n\nLearn more about [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar) and reviewing payments [here](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/reviews).\n\n## [Authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/update)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/list)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/approve](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/approve)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/decline](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/decline)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_create)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/capture](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_capture)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/expire](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_expire)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/finalize\\_amount](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_finalize_amount)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/increment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_increment)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/fraud\\_challenges/respond](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/respond_to_fraud_challenges)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/reverse](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_reverse)\n\n## [Cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/create)[POST/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/update)[GET/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/list)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/deliver](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_deliver)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/fail](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_fail)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/return](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_return)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/ship](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_ship)\n\n## [Physical Bundles](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/physical_bundles)\n\nA Physical Bundle represents the bundle of physical items - card stock, carrier letter, and envelope - that is shipped to a cardholder when you create a physical card.\n\n## [Reader](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/terminal/readers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/create)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/update)[GET/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/retrieve)[GET/v1/terminal/readers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/list)[DELETE/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/delete)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/cancel\\_action](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/cancel_action)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/collect\\_inputs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/collect_inputs)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/confirm\\_payment\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/confirm_payment_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/collect\\_payment\\_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/collect_payment_method)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/process\\_payment\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/process_payment_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/process\\_setup\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/process_setup_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/refund\\_payment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/refund_payment)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/set\\_reader\\_display](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/set_reader_display)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/terminal/readers/:id/present\\_payment\\_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/present_payment_method)\n\n## [Terminal Hardware Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_products)Preview feature\n\nA TerminalHardwareProduct is a category of hardware devices that are generally similar, but may have variations depending on the country it’s shipped to.\n\nTerminalHardwareSKUs represent variations within the same Product (for example, a country specific device). For example, WisePOS E is a TerminalHardwareProduct and a WisePOS E - US and WisePOS E - UK are TerminalHardwareSKUs.\n\n## [Terminal Hardware SKU](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_skus)Preview feature\n\nA TerminalHardwareSKU represents a SKU for Terminal hardware. A SKU is a representation of a product available for purchase, containing information such as the name, price, and images.\n\n## [Transaction Entries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/transaction_entries)\n\nTransactionEntries represent individual units of money movements within a single [Transaction](#transactions).\n\n## [Scheduled Queries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/sigma/scheduled_queries)\n\nIf you have [scheduled a Sigma query](https://docs.stripe.com/sigma/scheduled-queries), you’ll receive a `sigma.scheduled_query_run.created` webhook each time the query runs. The webhook contains a `ScheduledQueryRun` object, which you can use to retrieve the query results.\n\n## [Report Types](https://docs.stripe.com/api/reporting/report_type)\n\nThe Report Type resource corresponds to a particular type of report, such as the “Activity summary” or “Itemized payouts” reports. These objects are identified by an ID belonging to a set of enumerated values. See [API Access to Reports documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/reporting/statements/api) for those Report Type IDs, along with required and optional parameters.\n\nNote that certain report types can only be run based on your live-mode data (not test-mode data), and will error when queried without a [live-mode API key](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#test-live-modes).\n\n## [Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/financial_connections/sessions)\n\nA Financial Connections Session is the secure way to programmatically launch the client-side Stripe.js modal that lets your users link their accounts.\n\n## [Verification Report](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_reports)\n\nA VerificationReport is the result of an attempt to collect and verify data from a user. The collection of verification checks performed is determined from the `type` and `options` parameters used. You can find the result of each verification check performed in the appropriate sub-resource: `document`, `id_number`, `selfie`.\n\nEach VerificationReport contains a copy of any data collected by the user as well as reference IDs which can be used to access collected images through the [FileUpload](https://docs.stripe.com/api/files) API. To configure and create VerificationReports, use the [VerificationSession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_sessions) API.\n\nRelated guide: [Accessing verification results](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verification-sessions#results).\n\n## [Crypto Onramp Quotes](https://docs.stripe.com/api/crypto/onramp_quotes)\n\nCrypto Onramp Quotes are estimated quotes for onramp conversions into all the different cryptocurrencies on different networks. The Quotes API allows you to display quotes in your product UI before directing the user to the onramp widget.\n\nRelated guide: [Quotes API](https://docs.stripe.com/crypto/quotes-api)\n\n## [Climate Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/climate/product)\n\nA Climate product represents a type of carbon removal unit available for reservation. You can retrieve it to see the current price and availability.\n\n## [Forwarding Request](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/request)\n\nInstructs Stripe to make a request on your behalf using the destination URL. The destination URL is activated by Stripe at the time of onboarding. Stripe verifies requests with your credentials provided during onboarding, and injects card details from the payment\\_method into the request.\n\nStripe redacts all sensitive fields and headers, including authentication credentials and card numbers, before storing the request and response data in the forwarding Request object, which are subject to a 30-day retention period.\n\nYou can provide a Stripe idempotency key to make sure that requests with the same key result in only one outbound request. The Stripe idempotency key provided should be unique and different from any idempotency keys provided on the underlying third-party request.\n\nForwarding Requests are synchronous requests that return a response or time out according to Stripe’s limits.\n\nRelated guide: [Forward card details to third-party API endpoints](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/forwarding).\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/create)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/retrieve)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/list)",

You can use SetupAttempts to inspect details of a specific attempt at setting up a payment method using a SetupIntent.\n\n## [Confirmation Token](https://docs.stripe.com/api/confirmation_tokens)\n\nConfirmationTokens help transport client side data collected by Stripe JS over to your server for confirming a PaymentIntent or SetupIntent. If the confirmation is successful, values present on the ConfirmationToken are written onto the Intent.\n\nTo learn more about how to use ConfirmationToken, visit the related guides:\n\n*   [Finalize payments on the server](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/finalize-payments-on-the-server)\n*   [Build two-step confirmation](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/build-a-two-step-confirmation).\n\n## [Tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens)\n\nTokenization is the process Stripe uses to collect sensitive card or bank account details, or personally identifiable information (PII), directly from your customers in a secure manner. A token representing this information is returned to your server to use. Use our [recommended payments integrations](https://docs.stripe.com/payments) to perform this process on the client-side. This guarantees that no sensitive card data touches your server, and allows your integration to operate in a PCI-compliant way.\n\nIf you can’t use client-side tokenization, you can also create tokens using the API with either your publishable or secret API key. If your integration uses this method, you’re responsible for any PCI compliance that it might require, and you must keep your secret API key safe. Unlike with client-side tokenization, your customer’s information isn’t sent directly to Stripe, so we can’t determine how it’s handled or stored.\n\nYou can’t store or use tokens more than once. To store card or bank account information for later use, create [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api#customers) objects or [External accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/api#external_accounts). [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar), our integrated solution for automatic fraud protection, performs best with integrations that use client-side tokenization.\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_account)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_bank_account)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_card)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_cvc_update)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_person)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_pii)[GET/v1/tokens/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/retrieve)\n\n## [Cash Balance](https://docs.stripe.com/api/cash_balance)\n\nA customer’s `Cash balance` represents real funds. Customers can add funds to their cash balance by sending a bank transfer. These funds can be used for payment and can eventually be paid out to your bank account.\n\n## [Customer Portal Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customer_portal/sessions)\n\nThe Billing customer portal is a Stripe-hosted UI for subscription and billing management.\n\nA portal configuration describes the functionality and features that you want to provide to your customers through the portal.\n\nA portal session describes the instantiation of the customer portal for a particular customer. By visiting the session’s URL, the customer can manage their subscriptions and billing details. For security reasons, sessions are short-lived and will expire if the customer does not visit the URL. Create sessions on-demand when customers intend to manage their subscriptions and billing details.\n\nRelated guide: [Customer management](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management)\n\n## [Invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices)\n\nInvoices are statements of amounts owed by a customer, and are either generated one-off, or generated periodically from a subscription.\n\nThey contain [invoice items](#invoiceitems), and proration adjustments that may be caused by subscription upgrades/downgrades (if necessary).\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed through automatic charges, Stripe automatically finalizes your invoice and attempts payment. Note that finalizing the invoice, [when automatic](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/automatic-advancement-collection), does not happen immediately as the invoice is created. Stripe waits until one hour after the last webhook was successfully sent (or the last webhook timed out after failing). If you (and the platforms you may have connected to) have no webhooks configured, Stripe waits one hour after creation to finalize the invoice.\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed by sending an email, then based on your [email settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/billing/automatic), Stripe will email the invoice to your customer and await payment. These emails can contain a link to a hosted page to pay the invoice.\n\nStripe applies any customer credit on the account before determining the amount due for the invoice (i.e., the amount that will be actually charged). If the amount due for the invoice is less than Stripe’s [minimum allowed charge per currency](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts), the invoice is automatically marked paid, and we add the amount due to the customer’s credit balance which is applied to the next invoice.\n\nMore details on the customer’s credit balance are [here](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/customer/balance).\n\nRelated guide: [Send invoices to customers](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/invoices/sending)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create)[POST/v1/invoices/create\\_preview](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create_preview)[POST/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/lines/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_line)[GET/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/retrieve)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming)[GET/v1/invoices/:id/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming_invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/list)[DELETE/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/delete)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/add\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/add_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/remove\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/remove_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/update\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/finalize](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/finalize)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/mark\\_uncollectible](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/mark_uncollectible)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/pay](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/pay)[GET/v1/invoices/search](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/search)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/send](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/send)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/void](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/void)\n\n## [Meter Events](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event)\n\nA billing meter event represents a customer’s usage of a product. Meter events are used to bill a customer based on their usage. Meter events are associated with billing meters, which define the shape of the event’s payload and how those events are aggregated for billing.\n\n## [Meter Event Adjustment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_adjustment)\n\nA billing meter event adjustment is a resource that allows you to cancel a meter event. For example, you might create a billing meter event adjustment to cancel a meter event that was created in error or attached to the wrong customer.\n\n## [Meter Event Summary](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_summary)\n\nA billing meter event summary represents an aggregated view of a customer’s billing meter events within a specified timeframe. It indicates how much usage was accrued by a customer for that period.\n\n## [Plans](https://docs.stripe.com/api/plans)\n\nYou can now model subscriptions more flexibly using the [Prices API](#prices). It replaces the Plans API and is backwards compatible to simplify your migration.\n\nPlans define the base price, currency, and billing cycle for recurring purchases of products. [Products](#products) help you track inventory or provisioning, and plans help you track pricing. Different physical goods or levels of service should be represented by products, and pricing options should be represented by plans. This approach lets you change prices without having to change your provisioning scheme.\n\nFor example, you might have a single “gold” product that has plans for $10/month, $100/year, €9/month, and €90/year.\n\nRelated guides: [Set up a subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/set-up-subscription) and more about [products and prices](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/overview).\n\n## [Tax IDs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_create)[POST/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/create)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_retrieve)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/retrieve)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_list)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/list)[DELETE/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_delete)[DELETE/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/delete)\n\n## [Account Links](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_links)\n\nAccount Links are the means by which a Connect platform grants a connected account permission to access Stripe-hosted applications, such as Connect Onboarding.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect Onboarding](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom/hosted-onboarding)\n\n## [Account Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_sessions)\n\nAn AccountSession allows a Connect platform to grant access to a connected account in Connect embedded components.\n\nWe recommend that you create an AccountSession each time you need to display an embedded component to your user. Do not save AccountSessions to your database as they expire relatively quickly, and cannot be used more than once.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect embedded components](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-connect-embedded-components)\n\n## [Application Fees](https://docs.stripe.com/api/application_fees)\n\nWhen you collect a transaction fee on top of a charge made for your user (using [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)), an `Application Fee` object is created in your account. You can list, retrieve, and refund application fees.\n\nRelated guide: [Collecting application fees](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges#collect-fees)\n\n## [Country Specs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/country_specs)\n\nStripe needs to collect certain pieces of information about each account created. These requirements can differ depending on the account’s country. The Country Specs API makes these rules available to your integration.\n\nYou can also view the information from this API call as [an online guide](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information).\n\n## [Person](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/create)[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/update)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/retrieve)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/list)[DELETE/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/delete)\n\n## [Transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/transfers)\n\nA `Transfer` object is created when you move funds between Stripe accounts as part of Connect.\n\nBefore April 6, 2017, transfers also represented movement of funds from a Stripe account to a card or bank account. This behavior has since been split out into a [Payout](#payout_object) object, with corresponding payout endpoints. For more information, read about the [transfer/payout split](https://docs.stripe.com/transfer-payout-split).\n\nRelated guide: [Creating separate charges and transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n\n## [Secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/secret_management)\n\nSecret Store is an API that allows Stripe Apps developers to securely persist secrets for use by UI Extensions and app backends.\n\nThe primary resource in Secret Store is a `secret`. Other apps can’t view secrets created by an app. Additionally, secrets are scoped to provide further permission control.\n\nAll Dashboard users and the app backend share `account` scoped secrets. Use the `account` scope for secrets that don’t change per-user, like a third-party API key.\n\nA `user` scoped secret is accessible by the app backend and one specific Dashboard user. Use the `user` scope for per-user secrets like per-user OAuth tokens, where different users might have different permissions.\n\nRelated guide: [Store data between page reloads](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/store-auth-data-custom-objects)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[GET/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/list)[POST/v1/apps/secrets/delete](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/delete)[GET/v1/apps/secrets/find](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/find)[POST/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/set)\n\n## [Reviews](https://docs.stripe.com/api/radar/reviews)\n\nReviews can be used to supplement automated fraud detection with human expertise.\n\nLearn more about [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar) and reviewing payments [here](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/reviews).\n\n## [Authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/update)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/list)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/approve](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/approve)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/decline](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/decline)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_create)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/capture](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_capture)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/expire](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_expire)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/finalize\\_amount](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_finalize_amount)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/increment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_increment)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/fraud\\_challenges/respond](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/respond_to_fraud_challenges)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/reverse](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_reverse)\n\n## [Cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/create)[POST/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/update)[GET/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/list)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/deliver](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_deliver)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/fail](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_fail)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/return](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_return)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/ship](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_ship)\n\n## [Physical Bundles](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/physical_bundles)\n\nA Physical Bundle represents the bundle of physical items - card stock, carrier letter, and envelope - that is shipped to a cardholder when you create a physical card.\n\n## [Reader](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/terminal/readers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/create)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/update)[GET/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/retrieve)[GET/v1/terminal/readers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/list)[DELETE/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/delete)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/cancel\\_action](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/cancel_action)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/collect\\_inputs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/collect_inputs)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/confirm\\_payment\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/confirm_payment_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/collect\\_payment\\_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/collect_payment_method)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/process\\_payment\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/process_payment_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/process\\_setup\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/process_setup_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/refund\\_payment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/refund_payment)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/set\\_reader\\_display](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/set_reader_display)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/terminal/readers/:id/present\\_payment\\_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/present_payment_method)\n\n## [Terminal Hardware Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_products)Preview feature\n\nA TerminalHardwareProduct is a category of hardware devices that are generally similar, but may have variations depending on the country it’s shipped to.\n\nTerminalHardwareSKUs represent variations within the same Product (for example, a country specific device). For example, WisePOS E is a TerminalHardwareProduct and a WisePOS E - US and WisePOS E - UK are TerminalHardwareSKUs.\n\n## [Terminal Hardware SKU](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_skus)Preview feature\n\nA TerminalHardwareSKU represents a SKU for Terminal hardware. A SKU is a representation of a product available for purchase, containing information such as the name, price, and images.\n\n## [Transaction Entries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/transaction_entries)\n\nTransactionEntries represent individual units of money movements within a single [Transaction](#transactions).\n\n## [Scheduled Queries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/sigma/scheduled_queries)\n\nIf you have [scheduled a Sigma query](https://docs.stripe.com/sigma/scheduled-queries), you’ll receive a `sigma.scheduled_query_run.created` webhook each time the query runs. The webhook contains a `ScheduledQueryRun` object, which you can use to retrieve the query results.\n\n## [Report Types](https://docs.stripe.com/api/reporting/report_type)\n\nThe Report Type resource corresponds to a particular type of report, such as the “Activity summary” or “Itemized payouts” reports. These objects are identified by an ID belonging to a set of enumerated values. See [API Access to Reports documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/reporting/statements/api) for those Report Type IDs, along with required and optional parameters.\n\nNote that certain report types can only be run based on your live-mode data (not test-mode data), and will error when queried without a [live-mode API key](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#test-live-modes).\n\n## [Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/financial_connections/sessions)\n\nA Financial Connections Session is the secure way to programmatically launch the client-side Stripe.js modal that lets your users link their accounts.\n\n## [Verification Report](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_reports)\n\nA VerificationReport is the result of an attempt to collect and verify data from a user. The collection of verification checks performed is determined from the `type` and `options` parameters used. You can find the result of each verification check performed in the appropriate sub-resource: `document`, `id_number`, `selfie`.\n\nEach VerificationReport contains a copy of any data collected by the user as well as reference IDs which can be used to access collected images through the [FileUpload](https://docs.stripe.com/api/files) API. To configure and create VerificationReports, use the [VerificationSession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_sessions) API.\n\nRelated guide: [Accessing verification results](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verification-sessions#results).\n\n## [Crypto Onramp Quotes](https://docs.stripe.com/api/crypto/onramp_quotes)\n\nCrypto Onramp Quotes are estimated quotes for onramp conversions into all the different cryptocurrencies on different networks. The Quotes API allows you to display quotes in your product UI before directing the user to the onramp widget.\n\nRelated guide: [Quotes API](https://docs.stripe.com/crypto/quotes-api)\n\n## [Climate Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/climate/product)\n\nA Climate product represents a type of carbon removal unit available for reservation. You can retrieve it to see the current price and availability.\n\n## [Forwarding Request](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/request)\n\nInstructs Stripe to make a request on your behalf using the destination URL. The destination URL is activated by Stripe at the time of onboarding. Stripe verifies requests with your credentials provided during onboarding, and injects card details from the payment\\_method into the request.\n\nStripe redacts all sensitive fields and headers, including authentication credentials and card numbers, before storing the request and response data in the forwarding Request object, which are subject to a 30-day retention period.\n\nYou can provide a Stripe idempotency key to make sure that requests with the same key result in only one outbound request. The Stripe idempotency key provided should be unique and different from any idempotency keys provided on the underlying third-party request.\n\nForwarding Requests are synchronous requests that return a response or time out according to Stripe’s limits.\n\nRelated guide: [Forward card details to third-party API endpoints](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/forwarding).\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/create)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/retrieve)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/list)",

These approaches will perform any necessary steps to set up the PaymentMethod for future payments. Using the `/v1/payment_methods/:id/attach` endpoint without first using a SetupIntent or PaymentIntent with `setup_future_usage` does not optimize the PaymentMethod for future use, which makes later declines and payment friction more likely. See [Optimizing cards for future payments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents#future-usage) for more information about setting up future payments.\n\nTo use this PaymentMethod as the default for invoice or subscription payments, set [`invoice_settings.default_payment_method`](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/update#update_customer-invoice_settings-default_payment_method), on the Customer to the PaymentMethod’s ID.\n\n### Parameters\n\n*   The ID of the customer to which to attach the PaymentMethod.\n    \n\n### Returns\n\nReturns a PaymentMethod object.\n\nPOST /v1/payment\\_methods/:id/attach\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/payment_methods/pm_1MqM05LkdIwHu7ixlDxxO6Mc/attach \\  -u \"sk_test_4eC39Hq...arjtT1zdp7dcsk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc:\" \\  -d customer=cus_NbZ8Ki3f322LNn\n```\n\n```\n{  \"id\": \"pm_1MqM05LkdIwHu7ixlDxxO6Mc\",  \"object\": \"payment_method\",  \"billing_details\": {    \"address\": {      \"city\": null,      \"country\": null,      \"line1\": null,      \"line2\": null,      \"postal_code\": null,      \"state\": null    },    \"email\": null,    \"name\": null,    \"phone\": null  },  \"card\": {    \"brand\": \"visa\",    \"checks\": {      \"address_line1_check\": null,      \"address_postal_code_check\": null,      \"cvc_check\": \"pass\"    },    \"country\": \"US\",    \"exp_month\": 8,    \"exp_year\": 2026,    \"fingerprint\": \"mToisGZ01V71BCos\",    \"funding\": \"credit\",    \"generated_from\": null,    \"last4\": \"4242\",    \"networks\": {      \"available\": [        \"visa\"      ],      \"preferred\": null    },    \"three_d_secure_usage\": {      \"supported\": true    },    \"wallet\": null  },  \"created\": 1679946402,  \"customer\": \"cus_NbZ8Ki3f322LNn\",  \"livemode\": false,  \"metadata\": {},  \"type\": \"card\"}\n```\n\n## [Detach a PaymentMethod from a Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods/detach)\n\nDetaches a PaymentMethod object from a Customer. After a PaymentMethod is detached, it can no longer be used for a payment or re-attached to a Customer.\n\n### Parameters\n\nNo parameters.\n\n### Returns\n\nReturns a PaymentMethod object.\n\nPOST /v1/payment\\_methods/:id/detach\n\n```\ncurl -X POST https://api.stripe.com/v1/payment_methods/pm_1MqLiJLkdIwHu7ixUEgbFdYF/detach \\  -u \"sk_test_4eC39Hq...arjtT1zdp7dcsk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc:\"\n```\n\n```\n{  \"id\": \"pm_1MqLiJLkdIwHu7ixUEgbFdYF\",  \"object\": \"payment_method\",  \"billing_details\": {    \"address\": {      \"city\": null,      \"country\": null,      \"line1\": null,      \"line2\": null,      \"postal_code\": null,      \"state\": null    },    \"email\": null,    \"name\": null,    \"phone\": null  },  \"card\": {    \"brand\": \"visa\",    \"checks\": {      \"address_line1_check\": null,      \"address_postal_code_check\": null,      \"cvc_check\": \"unchecked\"    },    \"country\": \"US\",    \"exp_month\": 8,    \"exp_year\": 2026,    \"fingerprint\": \"mToisGZ01V71BCos\",    \"funding\": \"credit\",    \"generated_from\": null,    \"last4\": \"4242\",    \"networks\": {      \"available\": [        \"visa\"      ],      \"preferred\": null    },    \"three_d_secure_usage\": {      \"supported\": true    },    \"wallet\": null  },  \"created\": 1679945299,  \"customer\": null,  \"livemode\": false,  \"metadata\": {},  \"type\": \"card\"}\n```\n\n## [Cash Balance](https://docs.stripe.com/api/cash_balance)\n\nA customer’s `Cash balance` represents real funds. Customers can add funds to their cash balance by sending a bank transfer. These funds can be used for payment and can eventually be paid out to your bank account.\n\n## [Customer Portal Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customer_portal/sessions)\n\nThe Billing customer portal is a Stripe-hosted UI for subscription and billing management.\n\nA portal configuration describes the functionality and features that you want to provide to your customers through the portal.\n\nA portal session describes the instantiation of the customer portal for a particular customer. By visiting the session’s URL, the customer can manage their subscriptions and billing details. For security reasons, sessions are short-lived and will expire if the customer does not visit the URL. Create sessions on-demand when customers intend to manage their subscriptions and billing details.\n\nRelated guide: [Customer management](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management)\n\n## [Invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices)\n\nInvoices are statements of amounts owed by a customer, and are either generated one-off, or generated periodically from a subscription.\n\nThey contain [invoice items](#invoiceitems), and proration adjustments that may be caused by subscription upgrades/downgrades (if necessary).\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed through automatic charges, Stripe automatically finalizes your invoice and attempts payment. Note that finalizing the invoice, [when automatic](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/automatic-advancement-collection), does not happen immediately as the invoice is created. Stripe waits until one hour after the last webhook was successfully sent (or the last webhook timed out after failing). If you (and the platforms you may have connected to) have no webhooks configured, Stripe waits one hour after creation to finalize the invoice.\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed by sending an email, then based on your [email settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/billing/automatic), Stripe will email the invoice to your customer and await payment. These emails can contain a link to a hosted page to pay the invoice.\n\nStripe applies any customer credit on the account before determining the amount due for the invoice (i.e., the amount that will be actually charged). If the amount due for the invoice is less than Stripe’s [minimum allowed charge per currency](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts), the invoice is automatically marked paid, and we add the amount due to the customer’s credit balance which is applied to the next invoice.\n\nMore details on the customer’s credit balance are [here](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/customer/balance).\n\nRelated guide: [Send invoices to customers](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/invoices/sending)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create)[POST/v1/invoices/create\\_preview](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create_preview)[POST/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/lines/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_line)[GET/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/retrieve)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming)[GET/v1/invoices/:id/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming_invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/list)[DELETE/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/delete)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/add\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/add_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/remove\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/remove_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/update\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/finalize](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/finalize)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/mark\\_uncollectible](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/mark_uncollectible)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/pay](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/pay)[GET/v1/invoices/search](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/search)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/send](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/send)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/void](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/void)\n\n## [Meter Events](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event)\n\nA billing meter event represents a customer’s usage of a product. Meter events are used to bill a customer based on their usage. Meter events are associated with billing meters, which define the shape of the event’s payload and how those events are aggregated for billing.\n\n## [Meter Event Adjustment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_adjustment)\n\nA billing meter event adjustment is a resource that allows you to cancel a meter event. For example, you might create a billing meter event adjustment to cancel a meter event that was created in error or attached to the wrong customer.\n\n## [Meter Event Summary](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_summary)\n\nA billing meter event summary represents an aggregated view of a customer’s billing meter events within a specified timeframe. It indicates how much usage was accrued by a customer for that period.\n\n## [Plans](https://docs.stripe.com/api/plans)\n\nYou can now model subscriptions more flexibly using the [Prices API](#prices). It replaces the Plans API and is backwards compatible to simplify your migration.\n\nPlans define the base price, currency, and billing cycle for recurring purchases of products. [Products](#products) help you track inventory or provisioning, and plans help you track pricing. Different physical goods or levels of service should be represented by products, and pricing options should be represented by plans. This approach lets you change prices without having to change your provisioning scheme.\n\nFor example, you might have a single “gold” product that has plans for $10/month, $100/year, €9/month, and €90/year.\n\nRelated guides: [Set up a subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/set-up-subscription) and more about [products and prices](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/overview).\n\n## [Tax IDs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_create)[POST/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/create)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_retrieve)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/retrieve)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_list)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/list)[DELETE/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_delete)[DELETE/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/delete)\n\n## [Account Links](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_links)\n\nAccount Links are the means by which a Connect platform grants a connected account permission to access Stripe-hosted applications, such as Connect Onboarding.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect Onboarding](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom/hosted-onboarding)\n\n## [Account Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_sessions)\n\nAn AccountSession allows a Connect platform to grant access to a connected account in Connect embedded components.\n\nWe recommend that you create an AccountSession each time you need to display an embedded component to your user. Do not save AccountSessions to your database as they expire relatively quickly, and cannot be used more than once.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect embedded components](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-connect-embedded-components)\n\n## [Application Fees](https://docs.stripe.com/api/application_fees)\n\nWhen you collect a transaction fee on top of a charge made for your user (using [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)), an `Application Fee` object is created in your account. You can list, retrieve, and refund application fees.\n\nRelated guide: [Collecting application fees](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges#collect-fees)\n\n## [Country Specs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/country_specs)\n\nStripe needs to collect certain pieces of information about each account created. These requirements can differ depending on the account’s country. The Country Specs API makes these rules available to your integration.\n\nYou can also view the information from this API call as [an online guide](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information).\n\n## [Person](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/create)[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/update)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/retrieve)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/list)[DELETE/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/delete)\n\n## [Transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/transfers)\n\nA `Transfer` object is created when you move funds between Stripe accounts as part of Connect.\n\nBefore April 6, 2017, transfers also represented movement of funds from a Stripe account to a card or bank account. This behavior has since been split out into a [Payout](#payout_object) object, with corresponding payout endpoints. For more information, read about the [transfer/payout split](https://docs.stripe.com/transfer-payout-split).\n\nRelated guide: [Creating separate charges and transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n\n## [Secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/secret_management)\n\nSecret Store is an API that allows Stripe Apps developers to securely persist secrets for use by UI Extensions and app backends.\n\nThe primary resource in Secret Store is a `secret`. Other apps can’t view secrets created by an app. Additionally, secrets are scoped to provide further permission control.\n\nAll Dashboard users and the app backend share `account` scoped secrets. Use the `account` scope for secrets that don’t change per-user, like a third-party API key.\n\nA `user` scoped secret is accessible by the app backend and one specific Dashboard user. Use the `user` scope for per-user secrets like per-user OAuth tokens, where different users might have different permissions.\n\nRelated guide: [Store data between page reloads](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/store-auth-data-custom-objects)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[GET/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/list)[POST/v1/apps/secrets/delete](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/delete)[GET/v1/apps/secrets/find](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/find)[POST/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/set)\n\n## [Reviews](https://docs.stripe.com/api/radar/reviews)\n\nReviews can be used to supplement automated fraud detection with human expertise.\n\nLearn more about [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar) and reviewing payments [here](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/reviews).\n\n## [Authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/update)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/list)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/approve](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/approve)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/decline](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/decline)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_create)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/capture](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_capture)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/expire](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_expire)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/finalize\\_amount](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_finalize_amount)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/increment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_increment)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/fraud\\_challenges/respond](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/respond_to_fraud_challenges)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/reverse](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_reverse)\n\n## [Cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/create)[POST/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/update)[GET/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/list)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/deliver](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_deliver)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/fail](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_fail)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/return](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_return)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/ship](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_ship)\n\n## [Physical Bundles](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/physical_bundles)\n\nA Physical Bundle represents the bundle of physical items - card stock, carrier letter, and envelope - that is shipped to a cardholder when you create a physical card.\n\n## [Reader](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/terminal/readers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/create)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/update)[GET/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/retrieve)[GET/v1/terminal/readers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/list)[DELETE/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/delete)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/cancel\\_action](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/cancel_action)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/collect\\_inputs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/collect_inputs)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/confirm\\_payment\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/confirm_payment_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/collect\\_payment\\_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/collect_payment_method)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/process\\_payment\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/process_payment_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/process\\_setup\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/process_setup_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/refund\\_payment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/refund_payment)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/set\\_reader\\_display](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/set_reader_display)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/terminal/readers/:id/present\\_payment\\_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/present_payment_method)\n\n## [Terminal Hardware Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_products)Preview feature\n\nA TerminalHardwareProduct is a category of hardware devices that are generally similar, but may have variations depending on the country it’s shipped to.\n\nTerminalHardwareSKUs represent variations within the same Product (for example, a country specific device). For example, WisePOS E is a TerminalHardwareProduct and a WisePOS E - US and WisePOS E - UK are TerminalHardwareSKUs.\n\n## [Terminal Hardware SKU](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_skus)Preview feature\n\nA TerminalHardwareSKU represents a SKU for Terminal hardware. A SKU is a representation of a product available for purchase, containing information such as the name, price, and images.\n\n## [Transaction Entries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/transaction_entries)\n\nTransactionEntries represent individual units of money movements within a single [Transaction](#transactions).\n\n## [Scheduled Queries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/sigma/scheduled_queries)\n\nIf you have [scheduled a Sigma query](https://docs.stripe.com/sigma/scheduled-queries), you’ll receive a `sigma.scheduled_query_run.created` webhook each time the query runs. The webhook contains a `ScheduledQueryRun` object, which you can use to retrieve the query results.\n\n## [Report Types](https://docs.stripe.com/api/reporting/report_type)\n\nThe Report Type resource corresponds to a particular type of report, such as the “Activity summary” or “Itemized payouts” reports. These objects are identified by an ID belonging to a set of enumerated values. See [API Access to Reports documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/reporting/statements/api) for those Report Type IDs, along with required and optional parameters.\n\nNote that certain report types can only be run based on your live-mode data (not test-mode data), and will error when queried without a [live-mode API key](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#test-live-modes).\n\n## [Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/financial_connections/sessions)\n\nA Financial Connections Session is the secure way to programmatically launch the client-side Stripe.js modal that lets your users link their accounts.\n\n## [Verification Report](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_reports)\n\nA VerificationReport is the result of an attempt to collect and verify data from a user. The collection of verification checks performed is determined from the `type` and `options` parameters used. You can find the result of each verification check performed in the appropriate sub-resource: `document`, `id_number`, `selfie`.\n\nEach VerificationReport contains a copy of any data collected by the user as well as reference IDs which can be used to access collected images through the [FileUpload](https://docs.stripe.com/api/files) API. To configure and create VerificationReports, use the [VerificationSession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_sessions) API.\n\nRelated guide: [Accessing verification results](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verification-sessions#results).\n\n## [Crypto Onramp Quotes](https://docs.stripe.com/api/crypto/onramp_quotes)\n\nCrypto Onramp Quotes are estimated quotes for onramp conversions into all the different cryptocurrencies on different networks. The Quotes API allows you to display quotes in your product UI before directing the user to the onramp widget.\n\nRelated guide: [Quotes API](https://docs.stripe.com/crypto/quotes-api)\n\n## [Climate Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/climate/product)\n\nA Climate product represents a type of carbon removal unit available for reservation. You can retrieve it to see the current price and availability.\n\n## [Forwarding Request](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/request)\n\nInstructs Stripe to make a request on your behalf using the destination URL. The destination URL is activated by Stripe at the time of onboarding. Stripe verifies requests with your credentials provided during onboarding, and injects card details from the payment\\_method into the request.\n\nStripe redacts all sensitive fields and headers, including authentication credentials and card numbers, before storing the request and response data in the forwarding Request object, which are subject to a 30-day retention period.\n\nYou can provide a Stripe idempotency key to make sure that requests with the same key result in only one outbound request. The Stripe idempotency key provided should be unique and different from any idempotency keys provided on the underlying third-party request.\n\nForwarding Requests are synchronous requests that return a response or time out according to Stripe’s limits.\n\nRelated guide: [Forward card details to third-party API endpoints](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/forwarding).\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/create)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/retrieve)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/list)",

If you delete the last remaining card on a recipient, then the default\\_card attribute will become null.\n\nNote that for cards belonging to customers, you might want to prevent customers on paid subscriptions from deleting all cards on file, so that there is at least one default card for the next invoice payment attempt.\n\n### Parameters\n\nNo parameters.\n\n### Returns\n\nDELETE /v1/customers/:id/sources/:id\n\n```\ncurl -X DELETE https://api.stripe.com/v1/customers/acct_1032D82eZvKYlo2C/sources/card_1NGTaT2eZvKYlo2CZWSctn5n \\  -u \"sk_test_4eC39Hq...arjtT1zdp7dcsk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc:\"\n```\n\n```\n{  \"id\": \"card_1NGTaT2eZvKYlo2CZWSctn5n\",  \"object\": \"card\",  \"deleted\": true}\n```\n\n## [Customer Portal Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customer_portal/sessions)\n\nThe Billing customer portal is a Stripe-hosted UI for subscription and billing management.\n\nA portal configuration describes the functionality and features that you want to provide to your customers through the portal.\n\nA portal session describes the instantiation of the customer portal for a particular customer. By visiting the session’s URL, the customer can manage their subscriptions and billing details. For security reasons, sessions are short-lived and will expire if the customer does not visit the URL. Create sessions on-demand when customers intend to manage their subscriptions and billing details.\n\nRelated guide: [Customer management](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management)\n\n## [Invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices)\n\nInvoices are statements of amounts owed by a customer, and are either generated one-off, or generated periodically from a subscription.\n\nThey contain [invoice items](#invoiceitems), and proration adjustments that may be caused by subscription upgrades/downgrades (if necessary).\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed through automatic charges, Stripe automatically finalizes your invoice and attempts payment. Note that finalizing the invoice, [when automatic](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/automatic-advancement-collection), does not happen immediately as the invoice is created. Stripe waits until one hour after the last webhook was successfully sent (or the last webhook timed out after failing). If you (and the platforms you may have connected to) have no webhooks configured, Stripe waits one hour after creation to finalize the invoice.\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed by sending an email, then based on your [email settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/billing/automatic), Stripe will email the invoice to your customer and await payment. These emails can contain a link to a hosted page to pay the invoice.\n\nStripe applies any customer credit on the account before determining the amount due for the invoice (i.e., the amount that will be actually charged). If the amount due for the invoice is less than Stripe’s [minimum allowed charge per currency](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts), the invoice is automatically marked paid, and we add the amount due to the customer’s credit balance which is applied to the next invoice.\n\nMore details on the customer’s credit balance are [here](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/customer/balance).\n\nRelated guide: [Send invoices to customers](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/invoices/sending)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create)[POST/v1/invoices/create\\_preview](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create_preview)[POST/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/lines/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_line)[GET/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/retrieve)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming)[GET/v1/invoices/:id/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming_invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/list)[DELETE/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/delete)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/add\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/add_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/remove\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/remove_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/update\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/finalize](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/finalize)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/mark\\_uncollectible](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/mark_uncollectible)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/pay](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/pay)[GET/v1/invoices/search](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/search)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/send](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/send)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/void](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/void)\n\n## [Meter Events](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event)\n\nA billing meter event represents a customer’s usage of a product. Meter events are used to bill a customer based on their usage. Meter events are associated with billing meters, which define the shape of the event’s payload and how those events are aggregated for billing.\n\n## [Meter Event Adjustment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_adjustment)\n\nA billing meter event adjustment is a resource that allows you to cancel a meter event. For example, you might create a billing meter event adjustment to cancel a meter event that was created in error or attached to the wrong customer.\n\n## [Meter Event Summary](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_summary)\n\nA billing meter event summary represents an aggregated view of a customer’s billing meter events within a specified timeframe. It indicates how much usage was accrued by a customer for that period.\n\n## [Plans](https://docs.stripe.com/api/plans)\n\nYou can now model subscriptions more flexibly using the [Prices API](#prices). It replaces the Plans API and is backwards compatible to simplify your migration.\n\nPlans define the base price, currency, and billing cycle for recurring purchases of products. [Products](#products) help you track inventory or provisioning, and plans help you track pricing. Different physical goods or levels of service should be represented by products, and pricing options should be represented by plans. This approach lets you change prices without having to change your provisioning scheme.\n\nFor example, you might have a single “gold” product that has plans for $10/month, $100/year, €9/month, and €90/year.\n\nRelated guides: [Set up a subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/set-up-subscription) and more about [products and prices](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/overview).\n\n## [Tax IDs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_create)[POST/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/create)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_retrieve)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/retrieve)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_list)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/list)[DELETE/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_delete)[DELETE/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/delete)\n\n## [Account Links](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_links)\n\nAccount Links are the means by which a Connect platform grants a connected account permission to access Stripe-hosted applications, such as Connect Onboarding.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect Onboarding](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom/hosted-onboarding)\n\n## [Account Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_sessions)\n\nAn AccountSession allows a Connect platform to grant access to a connected account in Connect embedded components.\n\nWe recommend that you create an AccountSession each time you need to display an embedded component to your user. Do not save AccountSessions to your database as they expire relatively quickly, and cannot be used more than once.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect embedded components](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-connect-embedded-components)\n\n## [Application Fees](https://docs.stripe.com/api/application_fees)\n\nWhen you collect a transaction fee on top of a charge made for your user (using [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)), an `Application Fee` object is created in your account. You can list, retrieve, and refund application fees.\n\nRelated guide: [Collecting application fees](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges#collect-fees)\n\n## [Country Specs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/country_specs)\n\nStripe needs to collect certain pieces of information about each account created. These requirements can differ depending on the account’s country. The Country Specs API makes these rules available to your integration.\n\nYou can also view the information from this API call as [an online guide](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information).\n\n## [Person](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/create)[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/update)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/retrieve)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/list)[DELETE/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/delete)\n\n## [Transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/transfers)\n\nA `Transfer` object is created when you move funds between Stripe accounts as part of Connect.\n\nBefore April 6, 2017, transfers also represented movement of funds from a Stripe account to a card or bank account. This behavior has since been split out into a [Payout](#payout_object) object, with corresponding payout endpoints. For more information, read about the [transfer/payout split](https://docs.stripe.com/transfer-payout-split).\n\nRelated guide: [Creating separate charges and transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n\n## [Secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/secret_management)\n\nSecret Store is an API that allows Stripe Apps developers to securely persist secrets for use by UI Extensions and app backends.\n\nThe primary resource in Secret Store is a `secret`. Other apps can’t view secrets created by an app. Additionally, secrets are scoped to provide further permission control.\n\nAll Dashboard users and the app backend share `account` scoped secrets. Use the `account` scope for secrets that don’t change per-user, like a third-party API key.\n\nA `user` scoped secret is accessible by the app backend and one specific Dashboard user. Use the `user` scope for per-user secrets like per-user OAuth tokens, where different users might have different permissions.\n\nRelated guide: [Store data between page reloads](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/store-auth-data-custom-objects)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[GET/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/list)[POST/v1/apps/secrets/delete](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/delete)[GET/v1/apps/secrets/find](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/find)[POST/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/set)\n\n## [Reviews](https://docs.stripe.com/api/radar/reviews)\n\nReviews can be used to supplement automated fraud detection with human expertise.\n\nLearn more about [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar) and reviewing payments [here](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/reviews).\n\n## [Authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/update)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/list)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/approve](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/approve)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/decline](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/decline)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_create)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/capture](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_capture)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/expire](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_expire)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/finalize\\_amount](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_finalize_amount)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/increment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_increment)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/fraud\\_challenges/respond](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/respond_to_fraud_challenges)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/reverse](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_reverse)\n\n## [Cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/create)[POST/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/update)[GET/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/list)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/deliver](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_deliver)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/fail](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_fail)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/return](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_return)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/ship](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_ship)\n\n## [Physical Bundles](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/physical_bundles)\n\nA Physical Bundle represents the bundle of physical items - card stock, carrier letter, and envelope - that is shipped to a cardholder when you create a physical card.\n\n## [Reader](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/terminal/readers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/create)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/update)[GET/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/retrieve)[GET/v1/terminal/readers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/list)[DELETE/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/delete)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/cancel\\_action](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/cancel_action)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/collect\\_inputs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/collect_inputs)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/confirm\\_payment\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/confirm_payment_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/collect\\_payment\\_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/collect_payment_method)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/process\\_payment\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/process_payment_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/process\\_setup\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/process_setup_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/refund\\_payment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/refund_payment)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/set\\_reader\\_display](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/set_reader_display)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/terminal/readers/:id/present\\_payment\\_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/present_payment_method)\n\n## [Terminal Hardware Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_products)Preview feature\n\nA TerminalHardwareProduct is a category of hardware devices that are generally similar, but may have variations depending on the country it’s shipped to.\n\nTerminalHardwareSKUs represent variations within the same Product (for example, a country specific device). For example, WisePOS E is a TerminalHardwareProduct and a WisePOS E - US and WisePOS E - UK are TerminalHardwareSKUs.\n\n## [Terminal Hardware SKU](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_skus)Preview feature\n\nA TerminalHardwareSKU represents a SKU for Terminal hardware. A SKU is a representation of a product available for purchase, containing information such as the name, price, and images.\n\n## [Transaction Entries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/transaction_entries)\n\nTransactionEntries represent individual units of money movements within a single [Transaction](#transactions).\n\n## [Scheduled Queries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/sigma/scheduled_queries)\n\nIf you have [scheduled a Sigma query](https://docs.stripe.com/sigma/scheduled-queries), you’ll receive a `sigma.scheduled_query_run.created` webhook each time the query runs. The webhook contains a `ScheduledQueryRun` object, which you can use to retrieve the query results.\n\n## [Report Types](https://docs.stripe.com/api/reporting/report_type)\n\nThe Report Type resource corresponds to a particular type of report, such as the “Activity summary” or “Itemized payouts” reports. These objects are identified by an ID belonging to a set of enumerated values. See [API Access to Reports documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/reporting/statements/api) for those Report Type IDs, along with required and optional parameters.\n\nNote that certain report types can only be run based on your live-mode data (not test-mode data), and will error when queried without a [live-mode API key](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#test-live-modes).\n\n## [Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/financial_connections/sessions)\n\nA Financial Connections Session is the secure way to programmatically launch the client-side Stripe.js modal that lets your users link their accounts.\n\n## [Verification Report](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_reports)\n\nA VerificationReport is the result of an attempt to collect and verify data from a user. The collection of verification checks performed is determined from the `type` and `options` parameters used. You can find the result of each verification check performed in the appropriate sub-resource: `document`, `id_number`, `selfie`.\n\nEach VerificationReport contains a copy of any data collected by the user as well as reference IDs which can be used to access collected images through the [FileUpload](https://docs.stripe.com/api/files) API. To configure and create VerificationReports, use the [VerificationSession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_sessions) API.\n\nRelated guide: [Accessing verification results](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verification-sessions#results).\n\n## [Crypto Onramp Quotes](https://docs.stripe.com/api/crypto/onramp_quotes)\n\nCrypto Onramp Quotes are estimated quotes for onramp conversions into all the different cryptocurrencies on different networks. The Quotes API allows you to display quotes in your product UI before directing the user to the onramp widget.\n\nRelated guide: [Quotes API](https://docs.stripe.com/crypto/quotes-api)\n\n## [Climate Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/climate/product)\n\nA Climate product represents a type of carbon removal unit available for reservation. You can retrieve it to see the current price and availability.\n\n## [Forwarding Request](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/request)\n\nInstructs Stripe to make a request on your behalf using the destination URL. The destination URL is activated by Stripe at the time of onboarding. Stripe verifies requests with your credentials provided during onboarding, and injects card details from the payment\\_method into the request.\n\nStripe redacts all sensitive fields and headers, including authentication credentials and card numbers, before storing the request and response data in the forwarding Request object, which are subject to a 30-day retention period.\n\nYou can provide a Stripe idempotency key to make sure that requests with the same key result in only one outbound request. The Stripe idempotency key provided should be unique and different from any idempotency keys provided on the underlying third-party request.\n\nForwarding Requests are synchronous requests that return a response or time out according to Stripe’s limits.\n\nRelated guide: [Forward card details to third-party API endpoints](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/forwarding).\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/create)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/retrieve)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/list)",

You can use SetupAttempts to inspect details of a specific attempt at setting up a payment method using a SetupIntent.\n\n## [Confirmation Token](https://docs.stripe.com/api/confirmation_tokens)\n\nConfirmationTokens help transport client side data collected by Stripe JS over to your server for confirming a PaymentIntent or SetupIntent. If the confirmation is successful, values present on the ConfirmationToken are written onto the Intent.\n\nTo learn more about how to use ConfirmationToken, visit the related guides:\n\n*   [Finalize payments on the server](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/finalize-payments-on-the-server)\n*   [Build two-step confirmation](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/build-a-two-step-confirmation).\n\n## [Tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens)\n\nTokenization is the process Stripe uses to collect sensitive card or bank account details, or personally identifiable information (PII), directly from your customers in a secure manner. A token representing this information is returned to your server to use. Use our [recommended payments integrations](https://docs.stripe.com/payments) to perform this process on the client-side. This guarantees that no sensitive card data touches your server, and allows your integration to operate in a PCI-compliant way.\n\nIf you can’t use client-side tokenization, you can also create tokens using the API with either your publishable or secret API key. If your integration uses this method, you’re responsible for any PCI compliance that it might require, and you must keep your secret API key safe. Unlike with client-side tokenization, your customer’s information isn’t sent directly to Stripe, so we can’t determine how it’s handled or stored.\n\nYou can’t store or use tokens more than once. To store card or bank account information for later use, create [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api#customers) objects or [External accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/api#external_accounts). [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar), our integrated solution for automatic fraud protection, performs best with integrations that use client-side tokenization.\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_account)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_bank_account)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_card)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_cvc_update)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_person)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_pii)[GET/v1/tokens/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/retrieve)\n\n## [Cash Balance](https://docs.stripe.com/api/cash_balance)\n\nA customer’s `Cash balance` represents real funds. Customers can add funds to their cash balance by sending a bank transfer. These funds can be used for payment and can eventually be paid out to your bank account.\n\n## [Customer Portal Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customer_portal/sessions)\n\nThe Billing customer portal is a Stripe-hosted UI for subscription and billing management.\n\nA portal configuration describes the functionality and features that you want to provide to your customers through the portal.\n\nA portal session describes the instantiation of the customer portal for a particular customer. By visiting the session’s URL, the customer can manage their subscriptions and billing details. For security reasons, sessions are short-lived and will expire if the customer does not visit the URL. Create sessions on-demand when customers intend to manage their subscriptions and billing details.\n\nRelated guide: [Customer management](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management)\n\n## [Invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices)\n\nInvoices are statements of amounts owed by a customer, and are either generated one-off, or generated periodically from a subscription.\n\nThey contain [invoice items](#invoiceitems), and proration adjustments that may be caused by subscription upgrades/downgrades (if necessary).\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed through automatic charges, Stripe automatically finalizes your invoice and attempts payment. Note that finalizing the invoice, [when automatic](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/automatic-advancement-collection), does not happen immediately as the invoice is created.

These emails can contain a link to a hosted page to pay the invoice.\n\nStripe applies any customer credit on the account before determining the amount due for the invoice (i.e., the amount that will be actually charged). If the amount due for the invoice is less than Stripe’s [minimum allowed charge per currency](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts), the invoice is automatically marked paid, and we add the amount due to the customer’s credit balance which is applied to the next invoice.\n\nMore details on the customer’s credit balance are [here](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/customer/balance).\n\nRelated guide: [Send invoices to customers](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/invoices/sending)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create)[POST/v1/invoices/create\\_preview](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create_preview)[POST/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/lines/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_line)[GET/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/retrieve)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming)[GET/v1/invoices/:id/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming_invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/list)[DELETE/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/delete)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/add\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/add_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/remove\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/remove_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/update\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/finalize](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/finalize)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/mark\\_uncollectible](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/mark_uncollectible)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/pay](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/pay)[GET/v1/invoices/search](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/search)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/send](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/send)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/void](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/void)\n\n## [Meter Events](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event)\n\nA billing meter event represents a customer’s usage of a product. Meter events are used to bill a customer based on their usage. Meter events are associated with billing meters, which define the shape of the event’s payload and how those events are aggregated for billing.\n\n## [Meter Event Adjustment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_adjustment)\n\nA billing meter event adjustment is a resource that allows you to cancel a meter event. For example, you might create a billing meter event adjustment to cancel a meter event that was created in error or attached to the wrong customer.\n\n## [Meter Event Summary](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_summary)\n\nA billing meter event summary represents an aggregated view of a customer’s billing meter events within a specified timeframe. It indicates how much usage was accrued by a customer for that period.\n\n## [Plans](https://docs.stripe.com/api/plans)\n\nYou can now model subscriptions more flexibly using the [Prices API](#prices). It replaces the Plans API and is backwards compatible to simplify your migration.\n\nPlans define the base price, currency, and billing cycle for recurring purchases of products. [Products](#products) help you track inventory or provisioning, and plans help you track pricing. Different physical goods or levels of service should be represented by products, and pricing options should be represented by plans. This approach lets you change prices without having to change your provisioning scheme.\n\nFor example, you might have a single “gold” product that has plans for $10/month, $100/year, €9/month, and €90/year.\n\nRelated guides: [Set up a subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/set-up-subscription) and more about [products and prices](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/overview).\n\n## [Tax IDs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_create)[POST/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/create)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_retrieve)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/retrieve)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_list)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/list)[DELETE/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_delete)[DELETE/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/delete)\n\n## [Account Links](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_links)\n\nAccount Links are the means by which a Connect platform grants a connected account permission to access Stripe-hosted applications, such as Connect Onboarding.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect Onboarding](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom/hosted-onboarding)\n\n## [Account Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_sessions)\n\nAn AccountSession allows a Connect platform to grant access to a connected account in Connect embedded components.\n\nWe recommend that you create an AccountSession each time you need to display an embedded component to your user. Do not save AccountSessions to your database as they expire relatively quickly, and cannot be used more than once.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect embedded components](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-connect-embedded-components)\n\n## [Application Fees](https://docs.stripe.com/api/application_fees)\n\nWhen you collect a transaction fee on top of a charge made for your user (using [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)), an `Application Fee` object is created in your account.

These requirements can differ depending on the account’s country. The Country Specs API makes these rules available to your integration.\n\nYou can also view the information from this API call as [an online guide](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information).\n\n## [Person](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/create)[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/update)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/retrieve)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/list)[DELETE/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/delete)\n\n## [Transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/transfers)\n\nA `Transfer` object is created when you move funds between Stripe accounts as part of Connect.\n\nBefore April 6, 2017, transfers also represented movement of funds from a Stripe account to a card or bank account. This behavior has since been split out into a [Payout](#payout_object) object, with corresponding payout endpoints. For more information, read about the [transfer/payout split](https://docs.stripe.com/transfer-payout-split).\n\nRelated guide: [Creating separate charges and transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n\n## [Secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/secret_management)\n\nSecret Store is an API that allows Stripe Apps developers to securely persist secrets for use by UI Extensions and app backends.\n\nThe primary resource in Secret Store is a `secret`. Other apps can’t view secrets created by an app. Additionally, secrets are scoped to provide further permission control.\n\nAll Dashboard users and the app backend share `account` scoped secrets. Use the `account` scope for secrets that don’t change per-user, like a third-party API key.\n\nA `user` scoped secret is accessible by the app backend and one specific Dashboard user. Use the `user` scope for per-user secrets like per-user OAuth tokens, where different users might have different permissions.\n\nRelated guide: [Store data between page reloads](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/store-auth-data-custom-objects)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[GET/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/list)[POST/v1/apps/secrets/delete](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/delete)[GET/v1/apps/secrets/find](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/find)[POST/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/set)\n\n## [Reviews](https://docs.stripe.com/api/radar/reviews)\n\nReviews can be used to supplement automated fraud detection with human expertise.\n\nLearn more about [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar) and reviewing payments [here](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/reviews).\n\n## [Authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/update)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/list)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/approve](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/approve)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/decline](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/decline)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_create)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/capture](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_capture)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/expire](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_expire)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/finalize\\_amount](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_finalize_amount)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/increment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_increment)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/fraud\\_challenges/respond](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/respond_to_fraud_challenges)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/reverse](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_reverse)\n\n## [Cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/create)[POST/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/update)[GET/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/list)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/deliver](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_deliver)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/fail](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_fail)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/return](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_return)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/ship](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_ship)\n\n## [Physical Bundles](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/physical_bundles)\n\nA Physical Bundle represents the bundle of physical items -

For example, WisePOS E is a TerminalHardwareProduct and a WisePOS E - US and WisePOS E - UK are TerminalHardwareSKUs.\n\n## [Terminal Hardware SKU](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_skus)Preview feature\n\nA TerminalHardwareSKU represents a SKU for Terminal hardware. A SKU is a representation of a product available for purchase, containing information such as the name, price, and images.\n\n## [Transaction Entries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/transaction_entries)\n\nTransactionEntries represent individual units of money movements within a single [Transaction](#transactions).\n\n## [Scheduled Queries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/sigma/scheduled_queries)\n\nIf you have [scheduled a Sigma query](https://docs.stripe.com/sigma/scheduled-queries), you’ll receive a `sigma.scheduled_query_run.created` webhook each time the query runs. The webhook contains a `ScheduledQueryRun` object, which you can use to retrieve the query results.\n\n## [Report Types](https://docs.stripe.com/api/reporting/report_type)\n\nThe Report Type resource corresponds to a particular type of report, such as the “Activity summary” or “Itemized payouts” reports. These objects are identified by an ID belonging to a set of enumerated values. See [API Access to Reports documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/reporting/statements/api) for those Report Type IDs, along with required and optional parameters.\n\nNote that certain report types can only be run based on your live-mode data (not test-mode data), and will error when queried without a [live-mode API key](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#test-live-modes).\n\n## [Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/financial_connections/sessions)\n\nA Financial Connections Session is the secure way to programmatically launch the client-side Stripe.js modal that lets your users link their accounts.\n\n## [Verification Report](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_reports)\n\nA VerificationReport is the result of an attempt to collect and verify data from a user. The collection of verification checks performed is determined from the `type` and `options` parameters used. You can find the result of each verification check performed in the appropriate sub-resource: `document`, `id_number`, `selfie`.\n\nEach VerificationReport contains a copy of any data collected by the user as well as reference IDs which can be used to access collected images through the [FileUpload](https://docs.stripe.com/api/files) API. To configure and create VerificationReports, use the [VerificationSession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_sessions) API.\n\nRelated guide: [Accessing verification results](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verification-sessions#results).\n\n## [Crypto Onramp Quotes](https://docs.stripe.com/api/crypto/onramp_quotes)\n\nCrypto Onramp Quotes are estimated quotes for onramp conversions into all the different cryptocurrencies on different networks.

If you delete a card that is currently the default source, then the most recently added source will become the new default. If you delete a card that is the last remaining source on the customer, then the default\\_source attribute will become null.\n\nFor recipients: if you delete the default card, then the most recently added card will become the new default. If you delete the last remaining card on a recipient, then the default\\_card attribute will become null.\n\nNote that for cards belonging to customers, you might want to prevent customers on paid subscriptions from deleting all cards on file, so that there is at least one default card for the next invoice payment attempt.\n\n### Parameters\n\nNo parameters.\n\n### Returns\n\nDELETE /v1/customers/:id/sources/:id\n\n```\ncurl -X DELETE https://api.stripe.com/v1/customers/acct_1032D82eZvKYlo2C/sources/card_1NGTaT2eZvKYlo2CZWSctn5n \\  -u \"sk_test_4eC39Hq...arjtT1zdp7dcsk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc:\"\n```\n\n```\n{  \"id\": \"card_1NGTaT2eZvKYlo2CZWSctn5n\",  \"object\": \"card\",  \"deleted\": true}\n```\n\n## [Customer Portal Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customer_portal/sessions)\n\nThe Billing customer portal is a Stripe-hosted UI for subscription and billing management.\n\nA portal configuration describes the functionality and features that you want to provide to your customers through the portal.\n\nA portal session describes the instantiation of the customer portal for a particular customer. By visiting the session’s URL, the customer can manage their subscriptions and billing details. For security reasons, sessions are short-lived and will expire if the customer does not visit the URL. Create sessions on-demand when customers intend to manage their subscriptions and billing details.\n\nRelated guide: [Customer management](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management)\n\n## [Invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices)\n\nInvoices are statements of amounts owed by a customer, and are either generated one-off, or generated periodically from a subscription.\n\nThey contain [invoice items](#invoiceitems), and proration adjustments that may be caused by subscription upgrades/downgrades (if necessary).\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed through automatic charges, Stripe automatically finalizes your invoice and attempts payment. Note that finalizing the invoice, [when automatic](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/automatic-advancement-collection), does not happen immediately as the invoice is created. Stripe waits until one hour after the last webhook was successfully sent (or the last webhook timed out after failing). If you (and the platforms you may have connected to) have no webhooks configured, Stripe waits one hour after creation to finalize the invoice.\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed by sending an email, then based on your [email settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/billing/automatic), Stripe will email the invoice to your customer and await payment. These emails can contain a link to a hosted page to pay the invoice.\n\nStripe applies any customer credit on the account before determining the amount due for the invoice (i.e., the amount that will be actually charged).

This behavior has since been split out into a [Payout](#payout_object) object, with corresponding payout endpoints. For more information, read about the [transfer/payout split](https://docs.stripe.com/transfer-payout-split).\n\nRelated guide: [Creating separate charges and transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n\n## [Secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/secret_management)\n\nSecret Store is an API that allows Stripe Apps developers to securely persist secrets for use by UI Extensions and app backends.\n\nThe primary resource in Secret Store is a `secret`. Other apps can’t view secrets created by an app. Additionally, secrets are scoped to provide further permission control.\n\nAll Dashboard users and the app backend share `account` scoped secrets. Use the `account` scope for secrets that don’t change per-user, like a third-party API key.\n\nA `user` scoped secret is accessible by the app backend and one specific Dashboard user. Use the `user` scope for per-user secrets like per-user OAuth tokens, where different users might have different permissions.\n\nRelated guide: [Store data between page reloads](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/store-auth-data-custom-objects)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[GET/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/list)[POST/v1/apps/secrets/delete](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/delete)[GET/v1/apps/secrets/find](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/find)[POST/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/set)\n\n## [Reviews](https://docs.stripe.com/api/radar/reviews)\n\nReviews can be used to supplement automated fraud detection with human expertise.\n\nLearn more about [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar) and reviewing payments [here](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/reviews).\n\n## [Authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/update)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/list)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/approve](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/approve)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/decline](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/decline)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_create)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/capture](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_capture)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/expire](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_expire)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/finalize\\_amount](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_finalize_amount)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/increment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_increment)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/fraud\\_challenges/respond](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/respond_to_fraud_challenges)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/reverse](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_reverse)\n\n## [Cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/create)[POST/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/update)[GET/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/list)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/deliver](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_deliver)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/fail](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_fail)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/return](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_return)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/ship](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_ship)\n\n## [Physical Bundles](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/physical_bundles)\n\nA Physical Bundle represents the bundle of physical items - card stock, carrier letter, and envelope - that is shipped to a cardholder when you create a physical card.\n\n## [Reader](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/terminal/readers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/create)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/update)[GET/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/retrieve)[GET/v1/terminal/readers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/list)[DELETE/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/delete)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/cancel\\_action](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/cancel_action)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/collect\\_inputs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/collect_inputs)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/confirm\\_payment\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/confirm_payment_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/collect\\_payment\\_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/collect_payment_method)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/process\\_payment\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/process_payment_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/process\\_setup\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/process_setup_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/refund\\_payment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/refund_payment)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/set\\_reader\\_display](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/set_reader_display)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/terminal/readers/:id/present\\_payment\\_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/present_payment_method)\n\n## [Terminal Hardware Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_products)Preview feature\n\nA TerminalHardwareProduct is a category of hardware devices that are generally similar, but may have variations depending on the country it’s shipped to.\n\nTerminalHardwareSKUs represent variations within the same Product (for example, a country specific device). For example, WisePOS E is a TerminalHardwareProduct and a WisePOS E - US and WisePOS E - UK are TerminalHardwareSKUs.\n\n## [Terminal Hardware SKU](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_skus)Preview feature\n\nA TerminalHardwareSKU represents a SKU for Terminal hardware. A SKU is a representation of a product available for purchase, containing information such as the name, price, and images.\n\n## [Transaction Entries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/transaction_entries)\n\nTransactionEntries represent individual units of money movements within a single [Transaction](#transactions).\n\n## [Scheduled Queries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/sigma/scheduled_queries)\n\nIf you have [scheduled a Sigma query](https://docs.stripe.com/sigma/scheduled-queries), you’ll receive a `sigma.scheduled_query_run.created` webhook each time the query runs. The webhook contains a `ScheduledQueryRun` object, which you can use to retrieve the query results.\n\n## [Report Types](https://docs.stripe.com/api/reporting/report_type)\n\nThe Report Type resource corresponds to a particular type of report, such as the “Activity summary” or “Itemized payouts” reports. These objects are identified by an ID belonging to a set of enumerated values. See [API Access to Reports documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/reporting/statements/api) for those Report Type IDs, along with required and optional parameters.\n\nNote that certain report types can only be run based on your live-mode data (not test-mode data), and will error when queried without a [live-mode API key](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#test-live-modes).\n\n## [Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/financial_connections/sessions)\n\nA Financial Connections Session is the secure way to programmatically launch the client-side Stripe.js modal that lets your users link their accounts.\n\n## [Verification Report](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_reports)\n\nA VerificationReport is the result of an attempt to collect and verify data from a user. The collection of verification checks performed is determined from the `type` and `options` parameters used. You can find the result of each verification check performed in the appropriate sub-resource: `document`, `id_number`, `selfie`.\n\nEach VerificationReport contains a copy of any data collected by the user as well as reference IDs which can be used to access collected images through the [FileUpload](https://docs.stripe.com/api/files) API. To configure and create VerificationReports, use the [VerificationSession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_sessions) API.\n\nRelated guide: [Accessing verification results](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verification-sessions#results).\n\n## [Crypto Onramp Quotes](https://docs.stripe.com/api/crypto/onramp_quotes)\n\nCrypto Onramp Quotes are estimated quotes for onramp conversions into all the different cryptocurrencies on different networks. The Quotes API allows you to display quotes in your product UI before directing the user to the onramp widget.\n\nRelated guide: [Quotes API](https://docs.stripe.com/crypto/quotes-api)\n\n## [Climate Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/climate/product)\n\nA Climate product represents a type of carbon removal unit available for reservation. You can retrieve it to see the current price and availability.\n\n## [Forwarding Request](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/request)\n\nInstructs Stripe to make a request on your behalf using the destination URL. The destination URL is activated by Stripe at the time of onboarding. Stripe verifies requests with your credentials provided during onboarding, and injects card details from the payment\\_method into the request.\n\nStripe redacts all sensitive fields and headers, including authentication credentials and card numbers, before storing the request and response data in the forwarding Request object, which are subject to a 30-day retention period.\n\nYou can provide a Stripe idempotency key to make sure that requests with the same key result in only one outbound request. The Stripe idempotency key provided should be unique and different from any idempotency keys provided on the underlying third-party request.\n\nForwarding Requests are synchronous requests that return a response or time out according to Stripe’s limits.\n\nRelated guide: [Forward card details to third-party API endpoints](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/forwarding).\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/create)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/retrieve)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/list)",

If the confirmation is successful, values present on the ConfirmationToken are written onto the Intent.\n\nTo learn more about how to use ConfirmationToken, visit the related guides:\n\n*   [Finalize payments on the server](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/finalize-payments-on-the-server)\n*   [Build two-step confirmation](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/build-a-two-step-confirmation).\n\n## [Tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens)\n\nTokenization is the process Stripe uses to collect sensitive card or bank account details, or personally identifiable information (PII), directly from your customers in a secure manner. A token representing this information is returned to your server to use. Use our [recommended payments integrations](https://docs.stripe.com/payments) to perform this process on the client-side. This guarantees that no sensitive card data touches your server, and allows your integration to operate in a PCI-compliant way.\n\nIf you can’t use client-side tokenization, you can also create tokens using the API with either your publishable or secret API key. If your integration uses this method, you’re responsible for any PCI compliance that it might require, and you must keep your secret API key safe. Unlike with client-side tokenization, your customer’s information isn’t sent directly to Stripe, so we can’t determine how it’s handled or stored.\n\nYou can’t store or use tokens more than once. To store card or bank account information for later use, create [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api#customers) objects or [External accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/api#external_accounts). [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar), our integrated solution for automatic fraud protection, performs best with integrations that use client-side tokenization.\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_account)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_bank_account)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_card)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_cvc_update)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_person)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_pii)[GET/v1/tokens/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/retrieve)\n\n## [Cash Balance](https://docs.stripe.com/api/cash_balance)\n\nA customer’s `Cash balance` represents real funds. Customers can add funds to their cash balance by sending a bank transfer. These funds can be used for payment and can eventually be paid out to your bank account.\n\n## [Customer Portal Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customer_portal/sessions)\n\nThe Billing customer portal is a Stripe-hosted UI for subscription and billing management.\n\nA portal configuration describes the functionality and features that you want to provide to your customers through the portal.\n\nA portal session describes the instantiation of the customer portal for a particular customer. By visiting the session’s URL, the customer can manage their subscriptions and billing details. For security reasons, sessions are short-lived and will expire if the customer does not visit the URL. Create sessions on-demand when customers intend to manage their subscriptions and billing details.\n\nRelated guide: [Customer management](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management)\n\n## [Invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices)\n\nInvoices are statements of amounts owed by a customer, and are either generated one-off, or generated periodically from a subscription.\n\nThey contain [invoice items](#invoiceitems), and proration adjustments that may be caused by subscription upgrades/downgrades (if necessary).\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed through automatic charges, Stripe automatically finalizes your invoice and attempts payment. Note that finalizing the invoice, [when automatic](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/automatic-advancement-collection), does not happen immediately as the invoice is created. Stripe waits until one hour after the last webhook was successfully sent (or the last webhook timed out after failing). If you (and the platforms you may have connected to) have no webhooks configured, Stripe waits one hour after creation to finalize the invoice.\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed by sending an email, then based on your [email settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/billing/automatic), Stripe will email the invoice to your customer and await payment. These emails can contain a link to a hosted page to pay the invoice.\n\nStripe applies any customer credit on the account before determining the amount due for the invoice (i.e., the amount that will be actually charged). If the amount due for the invoice is less than Stripe’s [minimum allowed charge per currency](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts), the invoice is automatically marked paid, and we add the amount due to the customer’s credit balance which is applied to the next invoice.\n\nMore details on the customer’s credit balance are [here](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/customer/balance).\n\nRelated guide: [Send invoices to customers](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/invoices/sending)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create)[POST/v1/invoices/create\\_preview](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create_preview)[POST/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/lines/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_line)[GET/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/retrieve)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming)[GET/v1/invoices/:id/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming_invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/list)[DELETE/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/delete)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/add\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/add_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/remove\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/remove_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/update\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/finalize](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/finalize)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/mark\\_uncollectible](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/mark_uncollectible)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/pay](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/pay)[GET/v1/invoices/search](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/search)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/send](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/send)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/void](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/void)\n\n## [Meter Events](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event)\n\nA billing meter event represents a customer’s usage of a product. Meter events are used to bill a customer based on their usage. Meter events are associated with billing meters, which define the shape of the event’s payload and how those events are aggregated for billing.\n\n## [Meter Event Adjustment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_adjustment)\n\nA billing meter event adjustment is a resource that allows you to cancel a meter event. For example, you might create a billing meter event adjustment to cancel a meter event that was created in error or attached to the wrong customer.\n\n## [Meter Event Summary](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_summary)\n\nA billing meter event summary represents an aggregated view of a customer’s billing meter events within a specified timeframe. It indicates how much usage was accrued by a customer for that period.\n\n## [Plans](https://docs.stripe.com/api/plans)\n\nYou can now model subscriptions more flexibly using the [Prices API](#prices). It replaces the Plans API and is backwards compatible to simplify your migration.\n\nPlans define the base price, currency, and billing cycle for recurring purchases of products. [Products](#products) help you track inventory or provisioning, and plans help you track pricing. Different physical goods or levels of service should be represented by products, and pricing options should be represented by plans. This approach lets you change prices without having to change your provisioning scheme.\n\nFor example, you might have a single “gold” product that has plans for $10/month, $100/year, €9/month, and €90/year.\n\nRelated guides: [Set up a subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/set-up-subscription) and more about [products and prices](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/overview).\n\n## [Tax IDs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_create)[POST/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/create)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_retrieve)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/retrieve)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_list)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/list)[DELETE/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_delete)[DELETE/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/delete)\n\n## [Account Links](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_links)\n\nAccount Links are the means by which a Connect platform grants a connected account permission to access Stripe-hosted applications, such as Connect Onboarding.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect Onboarding](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom/hosted-onboarding)\n\n## [Account Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_sessions)\n\nAn AccountSession allows a Connect platform to grant access to a connected account in Connect embedded components.\n\nWe recommend that you create an AccountSession each time you need to display an embedded component to your user. Do not save AccountSessions to your database as they expire relatively quickly, and cannot be used more than once.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect embedded components](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-connect-embedded-components)\n\n## [Application Fees](https://docs.stripe.com/api/application_fees)\n\nWhen you collect a transaction fee on top of a charge made for your user (using [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)), an `Application Fee` object is created in your account. You can list, retrieve, and refund application fees.\n\nRelated guide: [Collecting application fees](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges#collect-fees)\n\n## [Country Specs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/country_specs)\n\nStripe needs to collect certain pieces of information about each account created. These requirements can differ depending on the account’s country. The Country Specs API makes these rules available to your integration.\n\nYou can also view the information from this API call as [an online guide](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information).\n\n## [Person](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/create)[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/update)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/retrieve)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/list)[DELETE/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/delete)\n\n## [Transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/transfers)\n\nA `Transfer` object is created when you move funds between Stripe accounts as part of Connect.\n\nBefore April 6, 2017, transfers also represented movement of funds from a Stripe account to a card or bank account. This behavior has since been split out into a [Payout](#payout_object) object, with corresponding payout endpoints. For more information, read about the [transfer/payout split](https://docs.stripe.com/transfer-payout-split).\n\nRelated guide: [Creating separate charges and transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n\n## [Secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/secret_management)\n\nSecret Store is an API that allows Stripe Apps developers to securely persist secrets for use by UI Extensions and app backends.\n\nThe primary resource in Secret Store is a `secret`. Other apps can’t view secrets created by an app. Additionally, secrets are scoped to provide further permission control.\n\nAll Dashboard users and the app backend share `account` scoped secrets. Use the `account` scope for secrets that don’t change per-user, like a third-party API key.\n\nA `user` scoped secret is accessible by the app backend and one specific Dashboard user. Use the `user` scope for per-user secrets like per-user OAuth tokens, where different users might have different permissions.\n\nRelated guide: [Store data between page reloads](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/store-auth-data-custom-objects)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[GET/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/list)[POST/v1/apps/secrets/delete](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/delete)[GET/v1/apps/secrets/find](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/find)[POST/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/set)\n\n## [Reviews](https://docs.stripe.com/api/radar/reviews)\n\nReviews can be used to supplement automated fraud detection with human expertise.\n\nLearn more about [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar) and reviewing payments [here](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/reviews).\n\n## [Authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/update)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/list)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/approve](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/approve)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/decline](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/decline)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_create)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/capture](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_capture)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/expire](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_expire)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/finalize\\_amount](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_finalize_amount)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/increment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_increment)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/fraud\\_challenges/respond](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/respond_to_fraud_challenges)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/reverse](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_reverse)\n\n## [Cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/create)[POST/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/update)[GET/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/list)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/deliver](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_deliver)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/fail](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_fail)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/return](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_return)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/ship](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_ship)\n\n## [Physical Bundles](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/physical_bundles)\n\nA Physical Bundle represents the bundle of physical items -

For example, WisePOS E is a TerminalHardwareProduct and a WisePOS E - US and WisePOS E - UK are TerminalHardwareSKUs.\n\n## [Terminal Hardware SKU](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_skus)Preview feature\n\nA TerminalHardwareSKU represents a SKU for Terminal hardware. A SKU is a representation of a product available for purchase, containing information such as the name, price, and images.\n\n## [Transaction Entries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/transaction_entries)\n\nTransactionEntries represent individual units of money movements within a single [Transaction](#transactions).\n\n## [Scheduled Queries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/sigma/scheduled_queries)\n\nIf you have [scheduled a Sigma query](https://docs.stripe.com/sigma/scheduled-queries), you’ll receive a `sigma.scheduled_query_run.created` webhook each time the query runs. The webhook contains a `ScheduledQueryRun` object, which you can use to retrieve the query results.\n\n## [Report Types](https://docs.stripe.com/api/reporting/report_type)\n\nThe Report Type resource corresponds to a particular type of report, such as the “Activity summary” or “Itemized payouts” reports. These objects are identified by an ID belonging to a set of enumerated values. See [API Access to Reports documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/reporting/statements/api) for those Report Type IDs, along with required and optional parameters.\n\nNote that certain report types can only be run based on your live-mode data (not test-mode data), and will error when queried without a [live-mode API key](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#test-live-modes).\n\n## [Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/financial_connections/sessions)\n\nA Financial Connections Session is the secure way to programmatically launch the client-side Stripe.js modal that lets your users link their accounts.\n\n## [Verification Report](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_reports)\n\nA VerificationReport is the result of an attempt to collect and verify data from a user. The collection of verification checks performed is determined from the `type` and `options` parameters used. You can find the result of each verification check performed in the appropriate sub-resource: `document`, `id_number`, `selfie`.\n\nEach VerificationReport contains a copy of any data collected by the user as well as reference IDs which can be used to access collected images through the [FileUpload](https://docs.stripe.com/api/files) API. To configure and create VerificationReports, use the [VerificationSession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_sessions) API.\n\nRelated guide: [Accessing verification results](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verification-sessions#results).\n\n## [Crypto Onramp Quotes](https://docs.stripe.com/api/crypto/onramp_quotes)\n\nCrypto Onramp Quotes are estimated quotes for onramp conversions into all the different cryptocurrencies on different networks. The Quotes API allows you to display quotes in your product UI before directing the user to the onramp widget.\n\nRelated guide: [Quotes API](https://docs.stripe.com/crypto/quotes-api)\n\n## [Climate Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/climate/product)\n\nA Climate product represents a type of carbon removal unit available for reservation. You can retrieve it to see the current price and availability.\n\n## [Forwarding Request](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/request)\n\nInstructs Stripe to make a request on your behalf using the destination URL. The destination URL is activated by Stripe at the time of onboarding. Stripe verifies requests with your credentials provided during onboarding, and injects card details from the payment\\_method into the request.\n\nStripe redacts all sensitive fields and headers, including authentication credentials and card numbers, before storing the request and response data in the forwarding Request object, which are subject to a 30-day retention period.\n\nYou can provide a Stripe idempotency key to make sure that requests with the same key result in only one outbound request. The Stripe idempotency key provided should be unique and different from any idempotency keys provided on the underlying third-party request.\n\nForwarding Requests are synchronous requests that return a response or time out according to Stripe’s limits.\n\nRelated guide: [Forward card details to third-party API endpoints](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/forwarding).\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/create)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/retrieve)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/list)",

    "markdown": "# Payouts to connected accounts | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Manage payouts and external accounts for your platform's connected accounts.\n\nBy default, any [charge](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/charges) you make on behalf of a connected account accumulates in the connected account’s [balance](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-balances) and is paid out on a daily rolling basis. Depending on the configuration of your connected accounts, your platform can manage their payouts as follows:\n\n*   Schedule [the frequency of automatic payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/manage-payout-schedule)\n*   Perform [manual payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/manual-payouts)\n*   Settle funds [instantly](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/instant-payouts)\n*   When using [destination charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges) or [separate charges and transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers), retain funds in your platform balance\n\n#### Note\n\nIn versions of Connect earlier than 2018, payouts were known as bank transfers and used the deprecated `transfers` API. For information about bank transfers, see the legacy [Transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/legacy-transfers) documentation.\n\n## Payout management configurations![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nFor connected accounts with access to the full Stripe Dashboard or Express Dashboard, the account holder manages their external [payout](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts \"payout\") accounts (bank accounts and debit cards), but the platform can schedule payouts. To schedule payouts for an account that has access to the full Stripe Dashboard, the platform must configure [Platform controls](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/platform-controls-for-stripe-dashboard-accounts) for the account.\n\nFor connected accounts without access to a Stripe-hosted Dashboard, the platform manages their external payout accounts and can schedule their payouts.\n\n## Supported settlement currencies ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nTo see which currencies you can use to settle funds in a particular country, select that country from the following dropdown.\n\n#### Note\n\nFor a list of supported presentment currencies, see the [currencies](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#presentment-currencies) documentation.\n\nLoading a table of connect payout currencies\n\nPlatforms can also enable their connected accounts to settle funds and pay out to banks in certain alternative currencies, or pay out to non-domestic bank accounts in the local currency. In some cases, Stripe charges a fee. For more information, see [Alternative currency payouts for Connect marketplaces and platforms](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/alternative-currency-payouts).\n\n### Using webhooks with payouts ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nYou can track all payout activity on connected accounts using [webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks) by listening for these events:\n\n*   `payout.created`\n*   `payout.updated`\n*   `payout.paid`\n*   `payout.failed`\n\nFor most payouts, event notifications occur over a series of days. Instant payouts typically send `payout.paid` within 30 minutes.\n\nWhen a payout can’t be completed, a `payout.failed` event occurs. The event’s `failure_code` property indicates the reason. A failed payout also disables the external account involved in that payout, triggering an `account.external_account.updated` event. No payouts can be made to that external account until the platform updates the connected account’s external accounts.",

    "markdown": "# Payment Method Configurations API | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Learn how to use the Configurations API to give connected account owners more control over the payment methods they offer.\n\nUse the Payment Method Configurations API to allow your connected account owners to opt in or opt out of a payment method through your own settings page. You can view which payment methods are enabled for connected accounts, market payment methods, and set display preferences for relevant payment types.\n\nYou can either build your own payment method settings UI with the API or use the embedded payment method settings component.\n\n[](#section-1)\n\nIn the Stripe Dashboard, set the platform-level default for individual payment methods in the [**Manage payment methods for your connected accounts**](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/settings/payment_methods/connected_accounts) page to edit the default-enabled payment methods.\n\nIn the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/login), click the gear icon in the top-right corner to open the **Product settings** page. Click the **Payment methods** link in the **Payments** section.\n\n![Settings option in the Dashboard](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/settings-api-dashboard.01bd465492acb49ada30fdda9e9f5d08.png)\n\n![Payment methods under Payments settings](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/settings-api-payment-methods.7824d81ee28dd2775b73d556da33d82a.png)\n\nAs a platform, you can set payment method preferences for your platform and for your connected accounts. The settings for **Your account** apply to your direct payment traffic. For example, if you charge your users a monthly fee to use your platform through your own checkout page, use the **Your Account** settings to manage those payments.\n\nThe settings for **Your connected accounts** enable you to manage the payment methods that the connected accounts on your platform can accept.\n\nTo set the default state for all connected accounts on your platform, click the **Edit settings** link under **Your connected accounts**.\n\n![Payment methods settings for your account and connected accounts](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/settings-api-connected-accounts.ba46dc06c0684b481667e91cf4e3fcfd.png)\n\nFor each payment method, use the dropdown to select the desired setting:\n\n*   **Off by default** connected accounts can turn the payment method on or off. The default is off.\n*   **Blocked** turns the payment method off for all connected accounts. Connected account owners can’t opt in.\n*   **On by default** connected accounts can turn the payment method on or off. The default is on.\n\n#### Note\n\nBy default, Stripe enables a few commonly used payment methods such as Cards, Apple Pay, and Google Pay.\n\n![Configure settings for each payment method](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/settings-api-wallets.956b27fd0756e064d433aaa5999130fe.png)\n\n[](#section-2)\n\nUse the Payment Method Configurations API with the connected account ID to read the current state of a payment method for a specific connected account. If the connected account has more than one configuration you can filter the results by your application’s `client_id`, located in your [Connect settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/applications/settings).\n\n`curl -G https://api.stripe.com/v1/payment_method_configurations \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -H \"Stripe-Account:   {{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}  \" \\  -d application=  {{CLIENT_APPLICATION_ID}}    `\n\n`{   \"object\": \"list\",   \"data\": [     {       \"id\":` \n\n`\"{{PAYMENT_METHOD_CONFIGURATION_ID}}\"`\n\n`,       \"object\": \"payment_method_configuration\",       \"name\": \"Default\",       \"active\": true,       \"is_default\": true,       \"livemode\": false,       \"application\":   \"{{CLIENT_APPLICATION_ID}}\"  ,       \"acss_debit\": {         \"available\": false,         \"display_preference\": {           \"overridable\": true,           \"preference\": \"off\",           \"value\": \"off\"         }       },       \"affirm\": {         \"available\": false,         \"display_preference\": {           \"overridable\": true,           \"preference\": \"off\",           \"value\": \"off\"         }       },       \"afterpay_clearpay\": {         \"available\": false,         \"display_preference\": {           \"overridable\": true,           \"preference\": \"off\",           \"value\": \"off\"         }       },       ... additional payment methods     }   ],   \"has_more\": false,   \"url\": \"/v1/payment_method_configurations\" }`\n\nIf successful, the return list displays each payment method and includes two parameters outlining availability and display preference.\n\n*   `available` is the combination of [capability](https://docs.stripe.com/api/capabilities/object) value (`active`, `inactive`, `pending`, or `unrequested`) and `display_preference` value.\n    \n    You can use the available field to know whether or not a buyer sees this payment method at checkout time. If available is `true`, that payment method’s capability is active and `display_preference` is on. If available is `false`, that payment method either doesn’t have an active capability or the `display_preference` value is off and buyers won’t see this payment method at checkout time. To simplify your integration and take advantage of other features, use dynamic payment methods at checkout time which automatically reads this parameter and shows the right payment methods to buyers.\n    \n*   `display_preference` has three components: `overridable`, `preference`, and `value`.\n    \n    *   `overridable` is read-only, and indicates whether the connected account’s preference can override the default set above.\n    *   `preference` is writable, and stores the connected account’s preference.\n    *   `value` is read-only, and reflects the effective `display_preference` value.\n\n#### Note\n\nOnly payment methods that are relevant in the connected account’s country are shown in the API response and are configurable. [Check country support](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/integration-options).\n\n[](#section-3)\n\nWhen a connected account owner takes action to turn on or off a payment method, you can update the `display_preference` `preference` attribute. This stores the connected account owner’s preference for that payment method and is used to determine whether the payment method is shown to buyers.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/payment_method_configurations/`\n\n`{{PAYMENT_METHOD_CONFIGURATION_ID}}`\n\n `\\  -u \"  sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc  :\" \\  -d \"affirm[display_preference][preference]\"=on`\n\n`{   \"id\":` \n\n`\"{{PAYMENT_METHOD_CONFIGURATION_ID}}\"`\n\n`,   \"object\": \"payment_method_configuration\",   \"name\": \"Default\",   \"active\": true,   \"is_default\": true,   \"livemode\": false,   \"application\":   \"{{CLIENT_APPLICATION_ID}}\"  ,   \"acss_debit\": {     \"available\": false,     \"display_preference\": {       \"overridable\": true,       \"preference\": \"off\",       \"value\": \"off\"     }   },   \"affirm\": {     \"available\": true,     \"display_preference\": {       \"overridable\": true,       \"preference\": \"on\",       \"value\": \"on\"     }   },   \"afterpay_clearpay\": {     \"available\": false,     \"display_preference\": {       \"overridable\": true,       \"preference\": \"off\",       \"value\": \"off\"     }   },   ... additional payment methods }`\n\n[](#section-4)\n\nYou can manage payment methods from the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods). Stripe handles the return of eligible payment methods based on factors such as the transaction’s amount, currency, and payment flow. This shows buyers in your checkout flow only the payment methods where `available` is `true`.\n\nIf you want to pre-fetch the available payment methods for a connected account before you render your checkout page, call the Payment Method Configurations API to get the list of payment methods. Use those with `available` set to `true`.\n\n[](#section-5)\n\nSome payment methods, such as Apple Pay and Link, aren’t included as separate payment method types on a PaymentIntent and are confirmed only when supplying `card`. With the Payment Method Configurations API, you can let connected account owners opt in or opt out of these specific payment methods and prevent them from showing up in the UI.\n\n[](#section-6)\n\nUse targeted marketing messaging to encourage connected account owners to opt in to specific payment methods they are eligible for but haven’t yet opted in to.\n\nCall the GET method to retrieve the status of the payment method configuration to determine when to promote a payment method. You can determine if a connected account owner has interacted with your configuration before by reading the `display_preference` value. If the `display_preference` `preference` is `none`, the connected account owner hasn’t changed the default configuration. If the `preference` value is `on` or `off`, the connected account owner has interacted with the configuration and you can choose whether to suppress the marketing message.",

Then at checkout, select which configuration you want to use. Stripe ranks the payment methods that are enabled within that configuration to optimize for conversion.\n\n## Before you begin![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n*   You must use either the Stripe [Payment Element](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-element) or [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout).\n*   You must use [Dynamic payment methods](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/dynamic-payment-methods) to enable additional payment methods from the Stripe Dashboard, which won’t require any code changes.\n    *   To set up dynamic payment methods for direct users, see the [payment method integration](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/dynamic-payment-methods) guide.\n    *   Connect To set up dynamic payment methods for Connect platforms, see [Upgrading to dynamic payment methods](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/dynamic-payment-methods).\n\n[](#create-payment-method-configuration)\n\nBy default, you have one payment method configuration called **Default Config**. You can create additional payment method configurations using both the Stripe Dashboard and the API.\n\n1.  In your Dashboard, go to [Payment methods settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/settings/payment_methods).\n2.  In the **Configuration Management** section, click the overflow menu (), then select **Create a configuration**.\n3.  Give your new configuration a name.\n4.

All payment methods are initially disabled by default.\n\nTo switch between configurations, use the **Select configuration** dropdown near the top of the page.\n\n[](#enable-payment-methods)\n\nIn the Dashboard, open the configuration and turn on the payment methods that you want to make available to buyers when using that configuration. A buyer sees only payment methods that are turned on and compatible with the payment location and currency.\n\n#### Note\n\nSome payment methods don’t show edit controls until you expand them.\n\n[](#section-4)\n\nCopy the `configuration ID` in the Dashboard from the configuration you want to use in your checkout flow.\n\nIf you’re using the [deferred intent creation integration path](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment-deferred), pass the `payment_method_configuration` ID when you create your Payment Element component. The Payment Element automatically pulls the payment methods associated with that configuration and ranks them to best convert buyers.\n\n`const options = {    mode: 'payment',    amount: 1099,    currency: 'usd',    payment_method_configuration: 'pmc_234' }`\n\nIf you aren’t using a Payment Element, pass the `payment_method_configuration` ID when you [create a Checkout session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create).\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/checkout/sessions \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d mode=payment \\  -d \"line_items[0][price]\"=  {{PRICE_ID}}   \\  -d \"line_items[0][quantity]\"=1 \\   --data-urlencode success_url=\"[https://example.com/success](https://example.com/success)\" \\   --data-urlencode cancel_url=\"[https://example.com/cancel](https://example.com/cancel)\" \\  -d currency=usd \\  -d payment_method_configuration=pmc_234`\n\nTo see how your payment methods appear to customers, enter a transaction ID or set an order amount and currency in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods/review).\n\n[](#create-payment-intent)\n\nCreate a PaymentIntent on your server using the payment method configuration.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/payment_intents \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d amount=1000 \\  -d currency=usd \\  -d \"automatic_payment_methods[enabled]\"=true \\  -d payment_method_configuration=pmc_123`\n\nIn the latest version of the API, the `automatic_payment_methods` parameter is optional because it’s enabled by default.",

Coupon creation is also accessible via the API if you need to create coupons on the fly.\n\nA coupon has either a `percent_off` or an `amount_off` and `currency`. If you set an `amount_off`, that amount will be subtracted from any invoice’s subtotal. For example, an invoice with a subtotal of 100 USD will have a final total of 0 USD if a coupon with an `amount_off` of 20000 is applied to it and an invoice with a subtotal of 300 USD will have a final total of 100 USD if a coupon with an `amount_off` of 20000 is applied to it.\n\n### Parameters\n\n*   A positive integer representing the amount to subtract from an invoice total (required if `percent_off` is not passed).\n    \n*   Three-letter [ISO code for the currency](https://stripe.com/docs/currencies) of the `amount_off` parameter (required if `amount_off` is passed).\n    \n*   Specifies how long the discount will be in effect if used on a subscription.

By visiting the session’s URL, the customer can manage their subscriptions and billing details. For security reasons, sessions are short-lived and will expire if the customer does not visit the URL. Create sessions on-demand when customers intend to manage their subscriptions and billing details.\n\nRelated guide: [Customer management](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management)\n\n## [Invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices)\n\nInvoices are statements of amounts owed by a customer, and are either generated one-off, or generated periodically from a subscription.\n\nThey contain [invoice items](#invoiceitems), and proration adjustments that may be caused by subscription upgrades/downgrades (if necessary).\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed through automatic charges, Stripe automatically finalizes your invoice and attempts payment. Note that finalizing the invoice, [when automatic](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/automatic-advancement-collection), does not happen immediately as the invoice is created. Stripe waits until one hour after the last webhook was successfully sent (or the last webhook timed out after failing). If you (and the platforms you may have connected to) have no webhooks configured, Stripe waits one hour after creation to finalize the invoice.\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed by sending an email, then based on your [email settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/billing/automatic), Stripe will email the invoice to your customer and await payment. These emails can contain a link to a hosted page to pay the invoice.\n\nStripe applies any customer credit on the account before determining the amount due for the invoice (i.e., the amount that will be actually charged). If the amount due for the invoice is less than Stripe’s [minimum allowed charge per currency](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts), the invoice is automatically marked paid, and we add the amount due to the customer’s credit balance which is applied to the next invoice.\n\nMore details on the customer’s credit balance are [here](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/customer/balance).\n\nRelated guide: [Send invoices to customers](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/invoices/sending)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create)[POST/v1/invoices/create\\_preview](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create_preview)[POST/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/lines/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_line)[GET/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/retrieve)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming)[GET/v1/invoices/:id/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming_invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/list)[DELETE/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/delete)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/add\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/add_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/remove\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/remove_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/update\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/finalize](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/finalize)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/mark\\_uncollectible](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/mark_uncollectible)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/pay](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/pay)[GET/v1/invoices/search](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/search)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/send](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/send)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/void](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/void)\n\n## [Meter Events](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event)\n\nA billing meter event represents a customer’s usage of a product. Meter events are used to bill a customer based on their usage. Meter events are associated with billing meters, which define the shape of the event’s payload and how those events are aggregated for billing.\n\n## [Meter Event Adjustment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_adjustment)\n\nA billing meter event adjustment is a resource that allows you to cancel a meter event. For example, you might create a billing meter event adjustment to cancel a meter event that was created in error or attached to the wrong customer.\n\n## [Meter Event Summary](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_summary)\n\nA billing meter event summary represents an aggregated view of a customer’s billing meter events within a specified timeframe. It indicates how much usage was accrued by a customer for that period.\n\n## [Plans](https://docs.stripe.com/api/plans)\n\nYou can now model subscriptions more flexibly using the [Prices API](#prices). It replaces the Plans API and is backwards compatible to simplify your migration.\n\nPlans define the base price, currency, and billing cycle for recurring purchases of products. [Products](#products) help you track inventory or provisioning, and plans help you track pricing. Different physical goods or levels of service should be represented by products, and pricing options should be represented by plans. This approach lets you change prices without having to change your provisioning scheme.\n\nFor example, you might have a single “gold” product that has plans for $10/month, $100/year, €9/month, and €90/year.\n\nRelated guides: [Set up a subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/set-up-subscription) and more about [products and prices](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/overview).\n\n## [Tax IDs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_create)[POST/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/create)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_retrieve)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/retrieve)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_list)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/list)[DELETE/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_delete)[DELETE/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/delete)\n\n## [Account Links](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_links)\n\nAccount Links are the means by which a Connect platform grants a connected account permission to access Stripe-hosted applications, such as Connect Onboarding.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect Onboarding](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom/hosted-onboarding)\n\n## [Account Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_sessions)\n\nAn AccountSession allows a Connect platform to grant access to a connected account in Connect embedded components.\n\nWe recommend that you create an AccountSession each time you need to display an embedded component to your user. Do not save AccountSessions to your database as they expire relatively quickly, and cannot be used more than once.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect embedded components](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-connect-embedded-components)\n\n## [Application Fees](https://docs.stripe.com/api/application_fees)\n\nWhen you collect a transaction fee on top of a charge made for your user (using [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)), an `Application Fee` object is created in your account. You can list, retrieve, and refund application fees.\n\nRelated guide: [Collecting application fees](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges#collect-fees)\n\n## [Country Specs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/country_specs)\n\nStripe needs to collect certain pieces of information about each account created. These requirements can differ depending on the account’s country. The Country Specs API makes these rules available to your integration.\n\nYou can also view the information from this API call as [an online guide](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information).\n\n## [Person](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/create)[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/update)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/retrieve)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/list)[DELETE/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/delete)\n\n## [Transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/transfers)\n\nA `Transfer` object is created when you move funds between Stripe accounts as part of Connect.\n\nBefore April 6, 2017, transfers also represented movement of funds from a Stripe account to a card or bank account. This behavior has since been split out into a [Payout](#payout_object) object, with corresponding payout endpoints. For more information, read about the [transfer/payout split](https://docs.stripe.com/transfer-payout-split).\n\nRelated guide: [Creating separate charges and transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n\n## [Secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/secret_management)\n\nSecret Store is an API that allows Stripe Apps developers to securely persist secrets for use by UI Extensions and app backends.\n\nThe primary resource in Secret Store is a `secret`. Other apps can’t view secrets created by an app. Additionally, secrets are scoped to provide further permission control.\n\nAll Dashboard users and the app backend share `account` scoped secrets. Use the `account` scope for secrets that don’t change per-user, like a third-party API key.\n\nA `user` scoped secret is accessible by the app backend and one specific Dashboard user. Use the `user` scope for per-user secrets like per-user OAuth tokens, where different users might have different permissions.\n\nRelated guide: [Store data between page reloads](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/store-auth-data-custom-objects)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[GET/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/list)[POST/v1/apps/secrets/delete](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/delete)[GET/v1/apps/secrets/find](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/find)[POST/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/set)\n\n## [Reviews](https://docs.stripe.com/api/radar/reviews)\n\nReviews can be used to supplement automated fraud detection with human expertise.\n\nLearn more about [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar) and reviewing payments [here](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/reviews).\n\n## [Authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/update)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/list)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/approve](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/approve)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/decline](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/decline)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_create)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/capture](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_capture)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/expire](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_expire)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/finalize\\_amount](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_finalize_amount)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/increment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_increment)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/fraud\\_challenges/respond](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/respond_to_fraud_challenges)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/reverse](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_reverse)\n\n## [Cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/create)[POST/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/update)[GET/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/list)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/deliver](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_deliver)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/fail](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_fail)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/return](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_return)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/ship](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_ship)\n\n## [Physical Bundles](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/physical_bundles)\n\nA Physical Bundle represents the bundle of physical items - card stock, carrier letter, and envelope - that is shipped to a cardholder when you create a physical card.\n\n## [Reader](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/terminal/readers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/create)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/update)[GET/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/retrieve)[GET/v1/terminal/readers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/list)[DELETE/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/delete)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/cancel\\_action](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/cancel_action)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/collect\\_inputs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/collect_inputs)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/confirm\\_payment\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/confirm_payment_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/collect\\_payment\\_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/collect_payment_method)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/process\\_payment\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/process_payment_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/process\\_setup\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/process_setup_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/refund\\_payment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/refund_payment)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/set\\_reader\\_display](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/set_reader_display)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/terminal/readers/:id/present\\_payment\\_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/present_payment_method)\n\n## [Terminal Hardware Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_products)Preview feature\n\nA TerminalHardwareProduct is a category of hardware devices that are generally similar, but may have variations depending on the country it’s shipped to.\n\nTerminalHardwareSKUs represent variations within the same Product (for example, a country specific device). For example, WisePOS E is a TerminalHardwareProduct and a WisePOS E - US and WisePOS E - UK are TerminalHardwareSKUs.\n\n## [Terminal Hardware SKU](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_skus)Preview feature\n\nA TerminalHardwareSKU represents a SKU for Terminal hardware. A SKU is a representation of a product available for purchase, containing information such as the name, price, and images.\n\n## [Transaction Entries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/transaction_entries)\n\nTransactionEntries represent individual units of money movements within a single [Transaction](#transactions).\n\n## [Scheduled Queries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/sigma/scheduled_queries)\n\nIf you have [scheduled a Sigma query](https://docs.stripe.com/sigma/scheduled-queries), you’ll receive a `sigma.scheduled_query_run.created` webhook each time the query runs. The webhook contains a `ScheduledQueryRun` object, which you can use to retrieve the query results.\n\n## [Report Types](https://docs.stripe.com/api/reporting/report_type)\n\nThe Report Type resource corresponds to a particular type of report, such as the “Activity summary” or “Itemized payouts” reports. These objects are identified by an ID belonging to a set of enumerated values. See [API Access to Reports documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/reporting/statements/api) for those Report Type IDs, along with required and optional parameters.\n\nNote that certain report types can only be run based on your live-mode data (not test-mode data), and will error when queried without a [live-mode API key](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#test-live-modes).\n\n## [Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/financial_connections/sessions)\n\nA Financial Connections Session is the secure way to programmatically launch the client-side Stripe.js modal that lets your users link their accounts.\n\n## [Verification Report](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_reports)\n\nA VerificationReport is the result of an attempt to collect and verify data from a user. The collection of verification checks performed is determined from the `type` and `options` parameters used. You can find the result of each verification check performed in the appropriate sub-resource: `document`, `id_number`, `selfie`.\n\nEach VerificationReport contains a copy of any data collected by the user as well as reference IDs which can be used to access collected images through the [FileUpload](https://docs.stripe.com/api/files) API. To configure and create VerificationReports, use the [VerificationSession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_sessions) API.\n\nRelated guide: [Accessing verification results](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verification-sessions#results).\n\n## [Crypto Onramp Quotes](https://docs.stripe.com/api/crypto/onramp_quotes)\n\nCrypto Onramp Quotes are estimated quotes for onramp conversions into all the different cryptocurrencies on different networks. The Quotes API allows you to display quotes in your product UI before directing the user to the onramp widget.\n\nRelated guide: [Quotes API](https://docs.stripe.com/crypto/quotes-api)\n\n## [Climate Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/climate/product)\n\nA Climate product represents a type of carbon removal unit available for reservation. You can retrieve it to see the current price and availability.\n\n## [Forwarding Request](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/request)\n\nInstructs Stripe to make a request on your behalf using the destination URL. The destination URL is activated by Stripe at the time of onboarding. Stripe verifies requests with your credentials provided during onboarding, and injects card details from the payment\\_method into the request.\n\nStripe redacts all sensitive fields and headers, including authentication credentials and card numbers, before storing the request and response data in the forwarding Request object, which are subject to a 30-day retention period.\n\nYou can provide a Stripe idempotency key to make sure that requests with the same key result in only one outbound request. The Stripe idempotency key provided should be unique and different from any idempotency keys provided on the underlying third-party request.\n\nForwarding Requests are synchronous requests that return a response or time out according to Stripe’s limits.\n\nRelated guide: [Forward card details to third-party API endpoints](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/forwarding).\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/create)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/retrieve)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/list)",

]}\n```\n\n## [Cash Balance](https://docs.stripe.com/api/cash_balance)\n\nA customer’s `Cash balance` represents real funds. Customers can add funds to their cash balance by sending a bank transfer. These funds can be used for payment and can eventually be paid out to your bank account.\n\n## [Customer Portal Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customer_portal/sessions)\n\nThe Billing customer portal is a Stripe-hosted UI for subscription and billing management.\n\nA portal configuration describes the functionality and features that you want to provide to your customers through the portal.\n\nA portal session describes the instantiation of the customer portal for a particular customer. By visiting the session’s URL, the customer can manage their subscriptions and billing details. For security reasons, sessions are short-lived and will expire if the customer does not visit the URL. Create sessions on-demand when customers intend to manage their subscriptions and billing details.\n\nRelated guide: [Customer management](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management)\n\n## [Invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices)\n\nInvoices are statements of amounts owed by a customer, and are either generated one-off, or generated periodically from a subscription.\n\nThey contain [invoice items](#invoiceitems), and proration adjustments that may be caused by subscription upgrades/downgrades (if necessary).\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed through automatic charges, Stripe automatically finalizes your invoice and attempts payment. Note that finalizing the invoice, [when automatic](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/automatic-advancement-collection), does not happen immediately as the invoice is created. Stripe waits until one hour after the last webhook was successfully sent (or the last webhook timed out after failing). If you (and the platforms you may have connected to) have no webhooks configured, Stripe waits one hour after creation to finalize the invoice.\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed by sending an email, then based on your [email settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/billing/automatic), Stripe will email the invoice to your customer and await payment. These emails can contain a link to a hosted page to pay the invoice.\n\nStripe applies any customer credit on the account before determining the amount due for the invoice (i.e., the amount that will be actually charged). If the amount due for the invoice is less than Stripe’s [minimum allowed charge per currency](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts), the invoice is automatically marked paid, and we add the amount due to the customer’s credit balance which is applied to the next invoice.\n\nMore details on the customer’s credit balance are [here](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/customer/balance).\n\nRelated guide: [Send invoices to customers](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/invoices/sending)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create)[POST/v1/invoices/create\\_preview](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create_preview)[POST/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/lines/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_line)[GET/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/retrieve)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming)[GET/v1/invoices/:id/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming_invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/list)[DELETE/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/delete)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/add\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/add_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/remove\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/remove_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/update\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/finalize](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/finalize)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/mark\\_uncollectible](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/mark_uncollectible)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/pay](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/pay)[GET/v1/invoices/search](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/search)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/send](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/send)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/void](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/void)\n\n## [Meter Events](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event)\n\nA billing meter event represents a customer’s usage of a product. Meter events are used to bill a customer based on their usage. Meter events are associated with billing meters, which define the shape of the event’s payload and how those events are aggregated for billing.\n\n## [Meter Event Adjustment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_adjustment)\n\nA billing meter event adjustment is a resource that allows you to cancel a meter event. For example, you might create a billing meter event adjustment to cancel a meter event that was created in error or attached to the wrong customer.\n\n## [Meter Event Summary](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_summary)\n\nA billing meter event summary represents an aggregated view of a customer’s billing meter events within a specified timeframe. It indicates how much usage was accrued by a customer for that period.\n\n## [Plans](https://docs.stripe.com/api/plans)\n\nYou can now model subscriptions more flexibly using the [Prices API](#prices). It replaces the Plans API and is backwards compatible to simplify your migration.\n\nPlans define the base price, currency, and billing cycle for recurring purchases of products. [Products](#products) help you track inventory or provisioning, and plans help you track pricing. Different physical goods or levels of service should be represented by products, and pricing options should be represented by plans. This approach lets you change prices without having to change your provisioning scheme.\n\nFor example, you might have a single “gold” product that has plans for $10/month, $100/year, €9/month, and €90/year.\n\nRelated guides: [Set up a subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/set-up-subscription) and more about [products and prices](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/overview).\n\n## [Tax IDs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_create)[POST/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/create)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_retrieve)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/retrieve)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_list)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/list)[DELETE/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_delete)[DELETE/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/delete)\n\n## [Account Links](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_links)\n\nAccount Links are the means by which a Connect platform grants a connected account permission to access Stripe-hosted applications, such as Connect Onboarding.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect Onboarding](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom/hosted-onboarding)\n\n## [Account Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_sessions)\n\nAn AccountSession allows a Connect platform to grant access to a connected account in Connect embedded components.\n\nWe recommend that you create an AccountSession each time you need to display an embedded component to your user. Do not save AccountSessions to your database as they expire relatively quickly, and cannot be used more than once.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect embedded components](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-connect-embedded-components)\n\n## [Application Fees](https://docs.stripe.com/api/application_fees)\n\nWhen you collect a transaction fee on top of a charge made for your user (using [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)), an `Application Fee` object is created in your account. You can list, retrieve, and refund application fees.\n\nRelated guide: [Collecting application fees](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges#collect-fees)\n\n## [Country Specs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/country_specs)\n\nStripe needs to collect certain pieces of information about each account created. These requirements can differ depending on the account’s country. The Country Specs API makes these rules available to your integration.\n\nYou can also view the information from this API call as [an online guide](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information).\n\n## [Person](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/create)[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/update)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/retrieve)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/list)[DELETE/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/delete)\n\n## [Transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/transfers)\n\nA `Transfer` object is created when you move funds between Stripe accounts as part of Connect.\n\nBefore April 6, 2017, transfers also represented movement of funds from a Stripe account to a card or bank account. This behavior has since been split out into a [Payout](#payout_object) object, with corresponding payout endpoints. For more information, read about the [transfer/payout split](https://docs.stripe.com/transfer-payout-split).\n\nRelated guide: [Creating separate charges and transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n\n## [Secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/secret_management)\n\nSecret Store is an API that allows Stripe Apps developers to securely persist secrets for use by UI Extensions and app backends.\n\nThe primary resource in Secret Store is a `secret`. Other apps can’t view secrets created by an app. Additionally, secrets are scoped to provide further permission control.\n\nAll Dashboard users and the app backend share `account` scoped secrets.

If the confirmation is successful, values present on the ConfirmationToken are written onto the Intent.\n\nTo learn more about how to use ConfirmationToken, visit the related guides:\n\n*   [Finalize payments on the server](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/finalize-payments-on-the-server)\n*   [Build two-step confirmation](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/build-a-two-step-confirmation).\n\n## [Tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens)\n\nTokenization is the process Stripe uses to collect sensitive card or bank account details, or personally identifiable information (PII), directly from your customers in a secure manner. A token representing this information is returned to your server to use. Use our [recommended payments integrations](https://docs.stripe.com/payments) to perform this process on the client-side. This guarantees that no sensitive card data touches your server, and allows your integration to operate in a PCI-compliant way.\n\nIf you can’t use client-side tokenization, you can also create tokens using the API with either your publishable or secret API key. If your integration uses this method, you’re responsible for any PCI compliance that it might require, and you must keep your secret API key safe. Unlike with client-side tokenization, your customer’s information isn’t sent directly to Stripe, so we can’t determine how it’s handled or stored.\n\nYou can’t store or use tokens more than once. To store card or bank account information for later use, create [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api#customers) objects or [External accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/api#external_accounts). [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar), our integrated solution for automatic fraud protection, performs best with integrations that use client-side tokenization.\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_account)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_bank_account)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_card)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_cvc_update)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_person)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_pii)[GET/v1/tokens/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/retrieve)\n\n## [Cash Balance](https://docs.stripe.com/api/cash_balance)\n\nA customer’s `Cash balance` represents real funds. Customers can add funds to their cash balance by sending a bank transfer. These funds can be used for payment and can eventually be paid out to your bank account.\n\n## [Customer Portal Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customer_portal/sessions)\n\nThe Billing customer portal is a Stripe-hosted UI for subscription and billing management.\n\nA portal configuration describes the functionality and features that you want to provide to your customers through the portal.\n\nA portal session describes the instantiation of the customer portal for a particular customer. By visiting the session’s URL, the customer can manage their subscriptions and billing details. For security reasons, sessions are short-lived and will expire if the customer does not visit the URL. Create sessions on-demand when customers intend to manage their subscriptions and billing details.\n\nRelated guide: [Customer management](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management)\n\n## [Invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices)\n\nInvoices are statements of amounts owed by a customer, and are either generated one-off, or generated periodically from a subscription.\n\nThey contain [invoice items](#invoiceitems), and proration adjustments that may be caused by subscription upgrades/downgrades (if necessary).\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed through automatic charges, Stripe automatically finalizes your invoice and attempts payment. Note that finalizing the invoice, [when automatic](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/automatic-advancement-collection), does not happen immediately as the invoice is created. Stripe waits until one hour after the last webhook was successfully sent (or the last webhook timed out after failing). If you (and the platforms you may have connected to) have no webhooks configured, Stripe waits one hour after creation to finalize the invoice.\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed by sending an email, then based on your [email settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/billing/automatic), Stripe will email the invoice to your customer and await payment. These emails can contain a link to a hosted page to pay the invoice.\n\nStripe applies any customer credit on the account before determining the amount due for the invoice (i.e., the amount that will be actually charged). If the amount due for the invoice is less than Stripe’s [minimum allowed charge per currency](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts), the invoice is automatically marked paid, and we add the amount due to the customer’s credit balance which is applied to the next invoice.\n\nMore details on the customer’s credit balance are [here](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/customer/balance).\n\nRelated guide: [Send invoices to customers](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/invoices/sending)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create)[POST/v1/invoices/create\\_preview](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create_preview)[POST/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/lines/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_line)[GET/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/retrieve)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming)[GET/v1/invoices/:id/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming_invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/list)[DELETE/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/delete)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/add\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/add_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/remove\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/remove_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/update\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/finalize](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/finalize)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/mark\\_uncollectible](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/mark_uncollectible)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/pay](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/pay)[GET/v1/invoices/search](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/search)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/send](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/send)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/void](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/void)\n\n## [Meter Events](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event)\n\nA billing meter event represents a customer’s usage of a product. Meter events are used to bill a customer based on their usage. Meter events are associated with billing meters, which define the shape of the event’s payload and how those events are aggregated for billing.\n\n## [Meter Event Adjustment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_adjustment)\n\nA billing meter event adjustment is a resource that allows you to cancel a meter event. For example, you might create a billing meter event adjustment to cancel a meter event that was created in error or attached to the wrong customer.\n\n## [Meter Event Summary](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_summary)\n\nA billing meter event summary represents an aggregated view of a customer’s billing meter events within a specified timeframe. It indicates how much usage was accrued by a customer for that period.\n\n## [Plans](https://docs.stripe.com/api/plans)\n\nYou can now model subscriptions more flexibly using the [Prices API](#prices). It replaces the Plans API and is backwards compatible to simplify your migration.\n\nPlans define the base price, currency, and billing cycle for recurring purchases of products. [Products](#products) help you track inventory or provisioning, and plans help you track pricing. Different physical goods or levels of service should be represented by products, and pricing options should be represented by plans. This approach lets you change prices without having to change your provisioning scheme.\n\nFor example, you might have a single “gold” product that has plans for $10/month, $100/year, €9/month, and €90/year.\n\nRelated guides: [Set up a subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/set-up-subscription) and more about [products and prices](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/overview).\n\n## [Tax IDs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_create)[POST/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/create)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_retrieve)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/retrieve)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_list)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/list)[DELETE/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_delete)[DELETE/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/delete)\n\n## [Account Links](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_links)\n\nAccount Links are the means by which a Connect platform grants a connected account permission to access Stripe-hosted applications, such as Connect Onboarding.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect Onboarding](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom/hosted-onboarding)\n\n## [Account Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_sessions)\n\nAn AccountSession allows a Connect platform to grant access to a connected account in Connect embedded components.\n\nWe recommend that you create an AccountSession each time you need to display an embedded component to your user. Do not save AccountSessions to your database as they expire relatively quickly, and cannot be used more than once.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect embedded components](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-connect-embedded-components)\n\n## [Application Fees](https://docs.stripe.com/api/application_fees)\n\nWhen you collect a transaction fee on top of a charge made for your user (using [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)), an `Application Fee` object is created in your account. You can list, retrieve, and refund application fees.\n\nRelated guide: [Collecting application fees](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges#collect-fees)\n\n## [Country Specs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/country_specs)\n\nStripe needs to collect certain pieces of information about each account created. These requirements can differ depending on the account’s country. The Country Specs API makes these rules available to your integration.\n\nYou can also view the information from this API call as [an online guide](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information).\n\n## [Person](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/create)[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/update)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/retrieve)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/list)[DELETE/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/delete)\n\n## [Transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/transfers)\n\nA `Transfer` object is created when you move funds between Stripe accounts as part of Connect.\n\nBefore April 6, 2017, transfers also represented movement of funds from a Stripe account to a card or bank account. This behavior has since been split out into a [Payout](#payout_object) object, with corresponding payout endpoints. For more information, read about the [transfer/payout split](https://docs.stripe.com/transfer-payout-split).\n\nRelated guide: [Creating separate charges and transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n\n## [Secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/secret_management)\n\nSecret Store is an API that allows Stripe Apps developers to securely persist secrets for use by UI Extensions and app backends.\n\nThe primary resource in Secret Store is a `secret`. Other apps can’t view secrets created by an app. Additionally, secrets are scoped to provide further permission control.\n\nAll Dashboard users and the app backend share `account` scoped secrets. Use the `account` scope for secrets that don’t change per-user, like a third-party API key.\n\nA `user` scoped secret is accessible by the app backend and one specific Dashboard user. Use the `user` scope for per-user secrets like per-user OAuth tokens, where different users might have different permissions.\n\nRelated guide: [Store data between page reloads](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/store-auth-data-custom-objects)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[GET/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/list)[POST/v1/apps/secrets/delete](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/delete)[GET/v1/apps/secrets/find](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/find)[POST/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/set)\n\n## [Reviews](https://docs.stripe.com/api/radar/reviews)\n\nReviews can be used to supplement automated fraud detection with human expertise.\n\nLearn more about [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar) and reviewing payments [here](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/reviews).\n\n## [Authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/update)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/list)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/approve](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/approve)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/decline](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/decline)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_create)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/capture](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_capture)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/expire](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_expire)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/finalize\\_amount](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_finalize_amount)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/increment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_increment)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/fraud\\_challenges/respond](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/respond_to_fraud_challenges)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/reverse](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_reverse)\n\n## [Cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/create)[POST/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/update)[GET/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/list)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/deliver](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_deliver)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/fail](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_fail)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/return](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_return)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/ship](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_ship)\n\n## [Physical Bundles](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/physical_bundles)\n\nA Physical Bundle represents the bundle of physical items - card stock, carrier letter, and envelope - that is shipped to a cardholder when you create a physical card.\n\n## [Reader](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/terminal/readers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/create)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/update)[GET/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/retrieve)[GET/v1/terminal/readers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/list)[DELETE/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/delete)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/cancel\\_action](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/cancel_action)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/collect\\_inputs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/collect_inputs)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/confirm\\_payment\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/confirm_payment_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/collect\\_payment\\_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/collect_payment_method)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/process\\_payment\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/process_payment_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/process\\_setup\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/process_setup_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/refund\\_payment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/refund_payment)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/set\\_reader\\_display](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/set_reader_display)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/terminal/readers/:id/present\\_payment\\_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/present_payment_method)\n\n## [Terminal Hardware Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_products)Preview feature\n\nA TerminalHardwareProduct is a category of hardware devices that are generally similar, but may have variations depending on the country it’s shipped to.\n\nTerminalHardwareSKUs represent variations within the same Product (for example, a country specific device). For example, WisePOS E is a TerminalHardwareProduct and a WisePOS E - US and WisePOS E - UK are TerminalHardwareSKUs.\n\n## [Terminal Hardware SKU](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_skus)Preview feature\n\nA TerminalHardwareSKU represents a SKU for Terminal hardware. A SKU is a representation of a product available for purchase, containing information such as the name, price, and images.\n\n## [Transaction Entries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/transaction_entries)\n\nTransactionEntries represent individual units of money movements within a single [Transaction](#transactions).\n\n## [Scheduled Queries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/sigma/scheduled_queries)\n\nIf you have [scheduled a Sigma query](https://docs.stripe.com/sigma/scheduled-queries), you’ll receive a `sigma.scheduled_query_run.created` webhook each time the query runs. The webhook contains a `ScheduledQueryRun` object, which you can use to retrieve the query results.\n\n## [Report Types](https://docs.stripe.com/api/reporting/report_type)\n\nThe Report Type resource corresponds to a particular type of report, such as the “Activity summary” or “Itemized payouts” reports. These objects are identified by an ID belonging to a set of enumerated values. See [API Access to Reports documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/reporting/statements/api) for those Report Type IDs, along with required and optional parameters.\n\nNote that certain report types can only be run based on your live-mode data (not test-mode data), and will error when queried without a [live-mode API key](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#test-live-modes).\n\n## [Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/financial_connections/sessions)\n\nA Financial Connections Session is the secure way to programmatically launch the client-side Stripe.js modal that lets your users link their accounts.\n\n## [Verification Report](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_reports)\n\nA VerificationReport is the result of an attempt to collect and verify data from a user. The collection of verification checks performed is determined from the `type` and `options` parameters used. You can find the result of each verification check performed in the appropriate sub-resource: `document`, `id_number`, `selfie`.\n\nEach VerificationReport contains a copy of any data collected by the user as well as reference IDs which can be used to access collected images through the [FileUpload](https://docs.stripe.com/api/files) API. To configure and create VerificationReports, use the [VerificationSession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_sessions) API.\n\nRelated guide: [Accessing verification results](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verification-sessions#results).\n\n## [Crypto Onramp Quotes](https://docs.stripe.com/api/crypto/onramp_quotes)\n\nCrypto Onramp Quotes are estimated quotes for onramp conversions into all the different cryptocurrencies on different networks. The Quotes API allows you to display quotes in your product UI before directing the user to the onramp widget.\n\nRelated guide: [Quotes API](https://docs.stripe.com/crypto/quotes-api)\n\n## [Climate Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/climate/product)\n\nA Climate product represents a type of carbon removal unit available for reservation. You can retrieve it to see the current price and availability.\n\n## [Forwarding Request](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/request)\n\nInstructs Stripe to make a request on your behalf using the destination URL. The destination URL is activated by Stripe at the time of onboarding. Stripe verifies requests with your credentials provided during onboarding, and injects card details from the payment\\_method into the request.\n\nStripe redacts all sensitive fields and headers, including authentication credentials and card numbers, before storing the request and response data in the forwarding Request object, which are subject to a 30-day retention period.\n\nYou can provide a Stripe idempotency key to make sure that requests with the same key result in only one outbound request. The Stripe idempotency key provided should be unique and different from any idempotency keys provided on the underlying third-party request.\n\nForwarding Requests are synchronous requests that return a response or time out according to Stripe’s limits.\n\nRelated guide: [Forward card details to third-party API endpoints](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/forwarding).\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/create)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/retrieve)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/list)",

By visiting the session’s URL, the customer can manage their subscriptions and billing details. For security reasons, sessions are short-lived and will expire if the customer does not visit the URL. Create sessions on-demand when customers intend to manage their subscriptions and billing details.\n\nRelated guide: [Customer management](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management)\n\n## [Invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices)\n\nInvoices are statements of amounts owed by a customer, and are either generated one-off, or generated periodically from a subscription.\n\nThey contain [invoice items](#invoiceitems), and proration adjustments that may be caused by subscription upgrades/downgrades (if necessary).\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed through automatic charges, Stripe automatically finalizes your invoice and attempts payment. Note that finalizing the invoice, [when automatic](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/automatic-advancement-collection), does not happen immediately as the invoice is created. Stripe waits until one hour after the last webhook was successfully sent (or the last webhook timed out after failing). If you (and the platforms you may have connected to) have no webhooks configured, Stripe waits one hour after creation to finalize the invoice.\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed by sending an email, then based on your [email settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/billing/automatic), Stripe will email the invoice to your customer and await payment. These emails can contain a link to a hosted page to pay the invoice.\n\nStripe applies any customer credit on the account before determining the amount due for the invoice (i.e., the amount that will be actually charged). If the amount due for the invoice is less than Stripe’s [minimum allowed charge per currency](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts), the invoice is automatically marked paid, and we add the amount due to the customer’s credit balance which is applied to the next invoice.\n\nMore details on the customer’s credit balance are [here](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/customer/balance).\n\nRelated guide: [Send invoices to customers](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/invoices/sending)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create)[POST/v1/invoices/create\\_preview](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create_preview)[POST/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/lines/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_line)[GET/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/retrieve)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming)[GET/v1/invoices/:id/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming_invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/list)[DELETE/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/delete)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/add\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/add_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/remove\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/remove_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/update\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/finalize](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/finalize)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/mark\\_uncollectible](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/mark_uncollectible)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/pay](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/pay)[GET/v1/invoices/search](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/search)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/send](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/send)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/void](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/void)\n\n## [Meter Events](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event)\n\nA billing meter event represents a customer’s usage of a product. Meter events are used to bill a customer based on their usage. Meter events are associated with billing meters, which define the shape of the event’s payload and how those events are aggregated for billing.\n\n## [Meter Event Adjustment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_adjustment)\n\nA billing meter event adjustment is a resource that allows you to cancel a meter event. For example, you might create a billing meter event adjustment to cancel a meter event that was created in error or attached to the wrong customer.\n\n## [Meter Event Summary](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_summary)\n\nA billing meter event summary represents an aggregated view of a customer’s billing meter events within a specified timeframe. It indicates how much usage was accrued by a customer for that period.\n\n## [Plans](https://docs.stripe.com/api/plans)\n\nYou can now model subscriptions more flexibly using the [Prices API](#prices). It replaces the Plans API and is backwards compatible to simplify your migration.\n\nPlans define the base price, currency, and billing cycle for recurring purchases of products. [Products](#products) help you track inventory or provisioning, and plans help you track pricing. Different physical goods or levels of service should be represented by products, and pricing options should be represented by plans. This approach lets you change prices without having to change your provisioning scheme.\n\nFor example, you might have a single “gold” product that has plans for $10/month, $100/year, €9/month, and €90/year.\n\nRelated guides: [Set up a subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/set-up-subscription) and more about [products and prices](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/overview).\n\n## [Tax IDs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_create)[POST/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/create)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_retrieve)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/retrieve)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_list)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/list)[DELETE/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_delete)[DELETE/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/delete)\n\n## [Account Links](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_links)\n\nAccount Links are the means by which a Connect platform grants a connected account permission to access Stripe-hosted applications, such as Connect Onboarding.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect Onboarding](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom/hosted-onboarding)\n\n## [Account Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_sessions)\n\nAn AccountSession allows a Connect platform to grant access to a connected account in Connect embedded components.\n\nWe recommend that you create an AccountSession each time you need to display an embedded component to your user. Do not save AccountSessions to your database as they expire relatively quickly, and cannot be used more than once.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect embedded components](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-connect-embedded-components)\n\n## [Application Fees](https://docs.stripe.com/api/application_fees)\n\nWhen you collect a transaction fee on top of a charge made for your user (using [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)), an `Application Fee` object is created in your account. You can list, retrieve, and refund application fees.\n\nRelated guide: [Collecting application fees](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges#collect-fees)\n\n## [Country Specs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/country_specs)\n\nStripe needs to collect certain pieces of information about each account created. These requirements can differ depending on the account’s country. The Country Specs API makes these rules available to your integration.\n\nYou can also view the information from this API call as [an online guide](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information).\n\n## [Person](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/create)[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/update)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/retrieve)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/list)[DELETE/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/delete)\n\n## [Transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/transfers)\n\nA `Transfer` object is created when you move funds between Stripe accounts as part of Connect.\n\nBefore April 6, 2017, transfers also represented movement of funds from a Stripe account to a card or bank account. This behavior has since been split out into a [Payout](#payout_object) object, with corresponding payout endpoints. For more information, read about the [transfer/payout split](https://docs.stripe.com/transfer-payout-split).\n\nRelated guide: [Creating separate charges and transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n\n## [Secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/secret_management)\n\nSecret Store is an API that allows Stripe Apps developers to securely persist secrets for use by UI Extensions and app backends.\n\nThe primary resource in Secret Store is a `secret`. Other apps can’t view secrets created by an app. Additionally, secrets are scoped to provide further permission control.\n\nAll Dashboard users and the app backend share `account` scoped secrets. Use the `account` scope for secrets that don’t change per-user, like a third-party API key.\n\nA `user` scoped secret is accessible by the app backend and one specific Dashboard user. Use the `user` scope for per-user secrets like per-user OAuth tokens, where different users might have different permissions.\n\nRelated guide: [Store data between page reloads](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/store-auth-data-custom-objects)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[GET/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/list)[POST/v1/apps/secrets/delete](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/delete)[GET/v1/apps/secrets/find](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/find)[POST/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/set)\n\n## [Reviews](https://docs.stripe.com/api/radar/reviews)\n\nReviews can be used to supplement automated fraud detection with human expertise.\n\nLearn more about [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar) and reviewing payments [here](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/reviews).\n\n## [Authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/update)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/list)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/approve](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/approve)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/decline](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/decline)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_create)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/capture](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_capture)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/expire](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_expire)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/finalize\\_amount](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_finalize_amount)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/increment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_increment)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/fraud\\_challenges/respond](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/respond_to_fraud_challenges)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/reverse](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_reverse)\n\n## [Cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/create)[POST/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/update)[GET/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/list)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/deliver](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_deliver)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/fail](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_fail)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/return](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_return)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/ship](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_ship)\n\n## [Physical Bundles](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/physical_bundles)\n\nA Physical Bundle represents the bundle of physical items -

For example, WisePOS E is a TerminalHardwareProduct and a WisePOS E - US and WisePOS E - UK are TerminalHardwareSKUs.\n\n## [Terminal Hardware SKU](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_skus)Preview feature\n\nA TerminalHardwareSKU represents a SKU for Terminal hardware. A SKU is a representation of a product available for purchase, containing information such as the name, price, and images.\n\n## [Transaction Entries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/transaction_entries)\n\nTransactionEntries represent individual units of money movements within a single [Transaction](#transactions).\n\n## [Scheduled Queries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/sigma/scheduled_queries)\n\nIf you have [scheduled a Sigma query](https://docs.stripe.com/sigma/scheduled-queries), you’ll receive a `sigma.scheduled_query_run.created` webhook each time the query runs. The webhook contains a `ScheduledQueryRun` object, which you can use to retrieve the query results.\n\n## [Report Types](https://docs.stripe.com/api/reporting/report_type)\n\nThe Report Type resource corresponds to a particular type of report, such as the “Activity summary” or “Itemized payouts” reports. These objects are identified by an ID belonging to a set of enumerated values. See [API Access to Reports documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/reporting/statements/api) for those Report Type IDs, along with required and optional parameters.\n\nNote that certain report types can only be run based on your live-mode data (not test-mode data), and will error when queried without a [live-mode API key](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#test-live-modes).\n\n## [Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/financial_connections/sessions)\n\nA Financial Connections Session is the secure way to programmatically launch the client-side Stripe.js modal that lets your users link their accounts.\n\n## [Verification Report](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_reports)\n\nA VerificationReport is the result of an attempt to collect and verify data from a user. The collection of verification checks performed is determined from the `type` and `options` parameters used. You can find the result of each verification check performed in the appropriate sub-resource: `document`, `id_number`, `selfie`.\n\nEach VerificationReport contains a copy of any data collected by the user as well as reference IDs which can be used to access collected images through the [FileUpload](https://docs.stripe.com/api/files) API. To configure and create VerificationReports, use the [VerificationSession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_sessions) API.\n\nRelated guide: [Accessing verification results](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verification-sessions#results).\n\n## [Crypto Onramp Quotes](https://docs.stripe.com/api/crypto/onramp_quotes)\n\nCrypto Onramp Quotes are estimated quotes for onramp conversions into all the different cryptocurrencies on different networks. The Quotes API allows you to display quotes in your product UI before directing the user to the onramp widget.\n\nRelated guide: [Quotes API](https://docs.stripe.com/crypto/quotes-api)\n\n## [Climate Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/climate/product)\n\nA Climate product represents a type of carbon removal unit available for reservation. You can retrieve it to see the current price and availability.\n\n## [Forwarding Request](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/request)\n\nInstructs Stripe to make a request on your behalf using the destination URL. The destination URL is activated by Stripe at the time of onboarding. Stripe verifies requests with your credentials provided during onboarding, and injects card details from the payment\\_method into the request.\n\nStripe redacts all sensitive fields and headers, including authentication credentials and card numbers, before storing the request and response data in the forwarding Request object, which are subject to a 30-day retention period.\n\nYou can provide a Stripe idempotency key to make sure that requests with the same key result in only one outbound request. The Stripe idempotency key provided should be unique and different from any idempotency keys provided on the underlying third-party request.\n\nForwarding Requests are synchronous requests that return a response or time out according to Stripe’s limits.\n\nRelated guide: [Forward card details to third-party API endpoints](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/forwarding).\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/create)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/retrieve)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/list)",

By visiting the session’s URL, the customer can manage their subscriptions and billing details. For security reasons, sessions are short-lived and will expire if the customer does not visit the URL. Create sessions on-demand when customers intend to manage their subscriptions and billing details.\n\nRelated guide: [Customer management](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management)\n\n## [Invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices)\n\nInvoices are statements of amounts owed by a customer, and are either generated one-off, or generated periodically from a subscription.\n\nThey contain [invoice items](#invoiceitems), and proration adjustments that may be caused by subscription upgrades/downgrades (if necessary).\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed through automatic charges, Stripe automatically finalizes your invoice and attempts payment. Note that finalizing the invoice, [when automatic](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/automatic-advancement-collection), does not happen immediately as the invoice is created. Stripe waits until one hour after the last webhook was successfully sent (or the last webhook timed out after failing). If you (and the platforms you may have connected to) have no webhooks configured, Stripe waits one hour after creation to finalize the invoice.\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed by sending an email, then based on your [email settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/billing/automatic), Stripe will email the invoice to your customer and await payment. These emails can contain a link to a hosted page to pay the invoice.\n\nStripe applies any customer credit on the account before determining the amount due for the invoice (i.e., the amount that will be actually charged). If the amount due for the invoice is less than Stripe’s [minimum allowed charge per currency](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts), the invoice is automatically marked paid, and we add the amount due to the customer’s credit balance which is applied to the next invoice.\n\nMore details on the customer’s credit balance are [here](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/customer/balance).\n\nRelated guide: [Send invoices to customers](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/invoices/sending)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create)[POST/v1/invoices/create\\_preview](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create_preview)[POST/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/lines/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_line)[GET/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/retrieve)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming)[GET/v1/invoices/:id/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming_invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/list)[DELETE/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/delete)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/add\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/add_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/remove\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/remove_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/update\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/finalize](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/finalize)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/mark\\_uncollectible](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/mark_uncollectible)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/pay](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/pay)[GET/v1/invoices/search](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/search)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/send](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/send)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/void](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/void)\n\n## [Meter Events](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event)\n\nA billing meter event represents a customer’s usage of a product. Meter events are used to bill a customer based on their usage. Meter events are associated with billing meters, which define the shape of the event’s payload and how those events are aggregated for billing.\n\n## [Meter Event Adjustment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_adjustment)\n\nA billing meter event adjustment is a resource that allows you to cancel a meter event. For example, you might create a billing meter event adjustment to cancel a meter event that was created in error or attached to the wrong customer.\n\n## [Meter Event Summary](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_summary)\n\nA billing meter event summary represents an aggregated view of a customer’s billing meter events within a specified timeframe. It indicates how much usage was accrued by a customer for that period.\n\n## [Plans](https://docs.stripe.com/api/plans)\n\nYou can now model subscriptions more flexibly using the [Prices API](#prices). It replaces the Plans API and is backwards compatible to simplify your migration.\n\nPlans define the base price, currency, and billing cycle for recurring purchases of products. [Products](#products) help you track inventory or provisioning, and plans help you track pricing. Different physical goods or levels of service should be represented by products, and pricing options should be represented by plans. This approach lets you change prices without having to change your provisioning scheme.\n\nFor example, you might have a single “gold” product that has plans for $10/month, $100/year, €9/month, and €90/year.\n\nRelated guides: [Set up a subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/set-up-subscription) and more about [products and prices](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/overview).\n\n## [Tax IDs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_create)[POST/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/create)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_retrieve)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/retrieve)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_list)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/list)[DELETE/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_delete)[DELETE/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/delete)\n\n## [Account Links](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_links)\n\nAccount Links are the means by which a Connect platform grants a connected account permission to access Stripe-hosted applications, such as Connect Onboarding.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect Onboarding](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom/hosted-onboarding)\n\n## [Account Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_sessions)\n\nAn AccountSession allows a Connect platform to grant access to a connected account in Connect embedded components.\n\nWe recommend that you create an AccountSession each time you need to display an embedded component to your user. Do not save AccountSessions to your database as they expire relatively quickly, and cannot be used more than once.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect embedded components](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-connect-embedded-components)\n\n## [Application Fees](https://docs.stripe.com/api/application_fees)\n\nWhen you collect a transaction fee on top of a charge made for your user (using [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)), an `Application Fee` object is created in your account. You can list, retrieve, and refund application fees.\n\nRelated guide: [Collecting application fees](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges#collect-fees)\n\n## [Country Specs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/country_specs)\n\nStripe needs to collect certain pieces of information about each account created. These requirements can differ depending on the account’s country. The Country Specs API makes these rules available to your integration.\n\nYou can also view the information from this API call as [an online guide](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information).\n\n## [Person](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/create)[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/update)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/retrieve)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/list)[DELETE/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/delete)\n\n## [Transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/transfers)\n\nA `Transfer` object is created when you move funds between Stripe accounts as part of Connect.\n\nBefore April 6, 2017, transfers also represented movement of funds from a Stripe account to a card or bank account. This behavior has since been split out into a [Payout](#payout_object) object, with corresponding payout endpoints. For more information, read about the [transfer/payout split](https://docs.stripe.com/transfer-payout-split).\n\nRelated guide: [Creating separate charges and transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n\n## [Secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/secret_management)\n\nSecret Store is an API that allows Stripe Apps developers to securely persist secrets for use by UI Extensions and app backends.\n\nThe primary resource in Secret Store is a `secret`. Other apps can’t view secrets created by an app. Additionally, secrets are scoped to provide further permission control.\n\nAll Dashboard users and the app backend share `account` scoped secrets. Use the `account` scope for secrets that don’t change per-user, like a third-party API key.\n\nA `user` scoped secret is accessible by the app backend and one specific Dashboard user. Use the `user` scope for per-user secrets like per-user OAuth tokens, where different users might have different permissions.\n\nRelated guide: [Store data between page reloads](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/store-auth-data-custom-objects)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[GET/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/list)[POST/v1/apps/secrets/delete](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/delete)[GET/v1/apps/secrets/find](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/find)[POST/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/set)\n\n## [Reviews](https://docs.stripe.com/api/radar/reviews)\n\nReviews can be used to supplement automated fraud detection with human expertise.\n\nLearn more about [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar) and reviewing payments [here](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/reviews).\n\n## [Authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/update)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/list)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/approve](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/approve)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/decline](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/decline)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_create)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/capture](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_capture)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/expire](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_expire)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/finalize\\_amount](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_finalize_amount)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/increment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_increment)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/fraud\\_challenges/respond](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/respond_to_fraud_challenges)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/reverse](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_reverse)\n\n## [Cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/create)[POST/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/update)[GET/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/list)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/deliver](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_deliver)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/fail](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_fail)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/return](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_return)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/ship](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_ship)\n\n## [Physical Bundles](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/physical_bundles)\n\nA Physical Bundle represents the bundle of physical items - card stock, carrier letter, and envelope - that is shipped to a cardholder when you create a physical card.\n\n## [Reader](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/terminal/readers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/create)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/update)[GET/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/retrieve)[GET/v1/terminal/readers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/list)[DELETE/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/delete)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/cancel\\_action](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/cancel_action)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/collect\\_inputs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/collect_inputs)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/confirm\\_payment\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/confirm_payment_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/collect\\_payment\\_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/collect_payment_method)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/process\\_payment\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/process_payment_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/process\\_setup\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/process_setup_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/refund\\_payment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/refund_payment)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/set\\_reader\\_display](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/set_reader_display)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/terminal/readers/:id/present\\_payment\\_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/present_payment_method)\n\n## [Terminal Hardware Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_products)Preview feature\n\nA TerminalHardwareProduct is a category of hardware devices that are generally similar, but may have variations depending on the country it’s shipped to.\n\nTerminalHardwareSKUs represent variations within the same Product (for example, a country specific device). For example, WisePOS E is a TerminalHardwareProduct and a WisePOS E - US and WisePOS E - UK are TerminalHardwareSKUs.\n\n## [Terminal Hardware SKU](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_skus)Preview feature\n\nA TerminalHardwareSKU represents a SKU for Terminal hardware. A SKU is a representation of a product available for purchase, containing information such as the name, price, and images.\n\n## [Transaction Entries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/transaction_entries)\n\nTransactionEntries represent individual units of money movements within a single [Transaction](#transactions).\n\n## [Scheduled Queries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/sigma/scheduled_queries)\n\nIf you have [scheduled a Sigma query](https://docs.stripe.com/sigma/scheduled-queries), you’ll receive a `sigma.scheduled_query_run.created` webhook each time the query runs. The webhook contains a `ScheduledQueryRun` object, which you can use to retrieve the query results.\n\n## [Report Types](https://docs.stripe.com/api/reporting/report_type)\n\nThe Report Type resource corresponds to a particular type of report, such as the “Activity summary” or “Itemized payouts” reports. These objects are identified by an ID belonging to a set of enumerated values. See [API Access to Reports documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/reporting/statements/api) for those Report Type IDs, along with required and optional parameters.\n\nNote that certain report types can only be run based on your live-mode data (not test-mode data), and will error when queried without a [live-mode API key](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#test-live-modes).\n\n## [Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/financial_connections/sessions)\n\nA Financial Connections Session is the secure way to programmatically launch the client-side Stripe.js modal that lets your users link their accounts.\n\n## [Verification Report](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_reports)\n\nA VerificationReport is the result of an attempt to collect and verify data from a user. The collection of verification checks performed is determined from the `type` and `options` parameters used. You can find the result of each verification check performed in the appropriate sub-resource: `document`, `id_number`, `selfie`.\n\nEach VerificationReport contains a copy of any data collected by the user as well as reference IDs which can be used to access collected images through the [FileUpload](https://docs.stripe.com/api/files) API. To configure and create VerificationReports, use the [VerificationSession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_sessions) API.\n\nRelated guide: [Accessing verification results](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verification-sessions#results).\n\n## [Crypto Onramp Quotes](https://docs.stripe.com/api/crypto/onramp_quotes)\n\nCrypto Onramp Quotes are estimated quotes for onramp conversions into all the different cryptocurrencies on different networks. The Quotes API allows you to display quotes in your product UI before directing the user to the onramp widget.\n\nRelated guide: [Quotes API](https://docs.stripe.com/crypto/quotes-api)\n\n## [Climate Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/climate/product)\n\nA Climate product represents a type of carbon removal unit available for reservation. You can retrieve it to see the current price and availability.\n\n## [Forwarding Request](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/request)\n\nInstructs Stripe to make a request on your behalf using the destination URL. The destination URL is activated by Stripe at the time of onboarding. Stripe verifies requests with your credentials provided during onboarding, and injects card details from the payment\\_method into the request.\n\nStripe redacts all sensitive fields and headers, including authentication credentials and card numbers, before storing the request and response data in the forwarding Request object, which are subject to a 30-day retention period.\n\nYou can provide a Stripe idempotency key to make sure that requests with the same key result in only one outbound request. The Stripe idempotency key provided should be unique and different from any idempotency keys provided on the underlying third-party request.\n\nForwarding Requests are synchronous requests that return a response or time out according to Stripe’s limits.\n\nRelated guide: [Forward card details to third-party API endpoints](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/forwarding).\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/create)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/retrieve)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/list)",

Returns an error if the payout is already canceled or can’t be canceled.\n\nPOST /v1/payouts/:id/cancel\n\n```\ncurl -X POST https://api.stripe.com/v1/payouts/po_1OaFDbEcg9tTZuTgNYmX0PKB/cancel \\  -u \"sk_test_4eC39Hq...arjtT1zdp7dcsk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc:\"\n```\n\n```\n{  \"id\": \"po_1OaFDbEcg9tTZuTgNYmX0PKB\",  \"object\": \"payout\",  \"amount\": 1100,  \"arrival_date\": 1680652800,  \"automatic\": false,  \"balance_transaction\": \"txn_1OaFDcEcg9tTZuTgYMR25tSe\",  \"created\": 1680648691,  \"currency\": \"usd\",  \"description\": null,  \"destination\": \"ba_1MtIhL2eZvKYlo2CAElKwKu2\",  \"failure_balance_transaction\": \"txn_1OaFJKEcg9tTZuTg2RdsWQhi\",  \"failure_code\": null,  \"failure_message\": null,  \"livemode\": false,  \"metadata\": {},  \"method\": \"standard\",  \"original_payout\": null,  \"reconciliation_status\": \"not_applicable\",  \"reversed_by\": null,  \"source_type\": \"card\",  \"statement_descriptor\": null,  \"status\": \"canceled\",  \"type\": \"bank_account\"}\n```\n\n## [Reverse a payout](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payouts/reverse)\n\nReverses a payout by debiting the destination bank account. At this time, you can only reverse payouts for connected accounts to US bank accounts. If the payout is manual and in the `pending` status, use `/v1/payouts/:id/cancel` instead.\n\nBy requesting a reversal through `/v1/payouts/:id/reverse`, you confirm that the authorized signatory of the selected bank account authorizes the debit on the bank account and that no other authorization is required.\n\n### Parameters\n\n*   Set of [key-value pairs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/metadata) that you can attach to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format. Individual keys can be unset by posting an empty value to them. All keys can be unset by posting an empty value to `metadata`.\n    \n\n### Returns\n\nReturns the reversing payout object if the reversal is successful.

If the confirmation is successful, values present on the ConfirmationToken are written onto the Intent.\n\nTo learn more about how to use ConfirmationToken, visit the related guides:\n\n*   [Finalize payments on the server](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/finalize-payments-on-the-server)\n*   [Build two-step confirmation](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/build-a-two-step-confirmation).\n\n## [Tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens)\n\nTokenization is the process Stripe uses to collect sensitive card or bank account details, or personally identifiable information (PII), directly from your customers in a secure manner. A token representing this information is returned to your server to use. Use our [recommended payments integrations](https://docs.stripe.com/payments) to perform this process on the client-side. This guarantees that no sensitive card data touches your server, and allows your integration to operate in a PCI-compliant way.\n\nIf you can’t use client-side tokenization, you can also create tokens using the API with either your publishable or secret API key. If your integration uses this method, you’re responsible for any PCI compliance that it might require, and you must keep your secret API key safe. Unlike with client-side tokenization, your customer’s information isn’t sent directly to Stripe, so we can’t determine how it’s handled or stored.\n\nYou can’t store or use tokens more than once. To store card or bank account information for later use, create [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api#customers) objects or [External accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/api#external_accounts). [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar), our integrated solution for automatic fraud protection, performs best with integrations that use client-side tokenization.\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_account)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_bank_account)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_card)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_cvc_update)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_person)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_pii)[GET/v1/tokens/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/retrieve)\n\n## [Cash Balance](https://docs.stripe.com/api/cash_balance)\n\nA customer’s `Cash balance` represents real funds. Customers can add funds to their cash balance by sending a bank transfer. These funds can be used for payment and can eventually be paid out to your bank account.\n\n## [Customer Portal Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customer_portal/sessions)\n\nThe Billing customer portal is a Stripe-hosted UI for subscription and billing management.\n\nA portal configuration describes the functionality and features that you want to provide to your customers through the portal.\n\nA portal session describes the instantiation of the customer portal for a particular customer. By visiting the session’s URL, the customer can manage their subscriptions and billing details. For security reasons, sessions are short-lived and will expire if the customer does not visit the URL. Create sessions on-demand when customers intend to manage their subscriptions and billing details.\n\nRelated guide: [Customer management](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management)\n\n## [Invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices)\n\nInvoices are statements of amounts owed by a customer, and are either generated one-off, or generated periodically from a subscription.\n\nThey contain [invoice items](#invoiceitems), and proration adjustments that may be caused by subscription upgrades/downgrades (if necessary).\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed through automatic charges, Stripe automatically finalizes your invoice and attempts payment. Note that finalizing the invoice, [when automatic](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/automatic-advancement-collection), does not happen immediately as the invoice is created. Stripe waits until one hour after the last webhook was successfully sent (or the last webhook timed out after failing). If you (and the platforms you may have connected to) have no webhooks configured, Stripe waits one hour after creation to finalize the invoice.\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed by sending an email, then based on your [email settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/billing/automatic), Stripe will email the invoice to your customer and await payment. These emails can contain a link to a hosted page to pay the invoice.\n\nStripe applies any customer credit on the account before determining the amount due for the invoice (i.e., the amount that will be actually charged). If the amount due for the invoice is less than Stripe’s [minimum allowed charge per currency](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts), the invoice is automatically marked paid, and we add the amount due to the customer’s credit balance which is applied to the next invoice.\n\nMore details on the customer’s credit balance are [here](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/customer/balance).\n\nRelated guide: [Send invoices to customers](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/invoices/sending)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create)[POST/v1/invoices/create\\_preview](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create_preview)[POST/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/lines/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_line)[GET/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/retrieve)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming)[GET/v1/invoices/:id/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming_invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/list)[DELETE/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/delete)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/add\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/add_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/remove\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/remove_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/update\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/finalize](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/finalize)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/mark\\_uncollectible](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/mark_uncollectible)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/pay](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/pay)[GET/v1/invoices/search](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/search)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/send](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/send)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/void](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/void)\n\n## [Meter Events](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event)\n\nA billing meter event represents a customer’s usage of a product. Meter events are used to bill a customer based on their usage. Meter events are associated with billing meters, which define the shape of the event’s payload and how those events are aggregated for billing.\n\n## [Meter Event Adjustment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_adjustment)\n\nA billing meter event adjustment is a resource that allows you to cancel a meter event. For example, you might create a billing meter event adjustment to cancel a meter event that was created in error or attached to the wrong customer.\n\n## [Meter Event Summary](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_summary)\n\nA billing meter event summary represents an aggregated view of a customer’s billing meter events within a specified timeframe. It indicates how much usage was accrued by a customer for that period.\n\n## [Plans](https://docs.stripe.com/api/plans)\n\nYou can now model subscriptions more flexibly using the [Prices API](#prices). It replaces the Plans API and is backwards compatible to simplify your migration.\n\nPlans define the base price, currency, and billing cycle for recurring purchases of products. [Products](#products) help you track inventory or provisioning, and plans help you track pricing. Different physical goods or levels of service should be represented by products, and pricing options should be represented by plans. This approach lets you change prices without having to change your provisioning scheme.\n\nFor example, you might have a single “gold” product that has plans for $10/month, $100/year, €9/month, and €90/year.\n\nRelated guides: [Set up a subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/set-up-subscription) and more about [products and prices](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/overview).\n\n## [Tax IDs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_create)[POST/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/create)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_retrieve)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/retrieve)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_list)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/list)[DELETE/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_delete)[DELETE/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/delete)\n\n## [Account Links](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_links)\n\nAccount Links are the means by which a Connect platform grants a connected account permission to access Stripe-hosted applications, such as Connect Onboarding.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect Onboarding](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom/hosted-onboarding)\n\n## [Account Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_sessions)\n\nAn AccountSession allows a Connect platform to grant access to a connected account in Connect embedded components.\n\nWe recommend that you create an AccountSession each time you need to display an embedded component to your user. Do not save AccountSessions to your database as they expire relatively quickly, and cannot be used more than once.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect embedded components](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-connect-embedded-components)\n\n## [Application Fees](https://docs.stripe.com/api/application_fees)\n\nWhen you collect a transaction fee on top of a charge made for your user (using [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)), an `Application Fee` object is created in your account. You can list, retrieve, and refund application fees.\n\nRelated guide: [Collecting application fees](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges#collect-fees)\n\n## [Country Specs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/country_specs)\n\nStripe needs to collect certain pieces of information about each account created. These requirements can differ depending on the account’s country. The Country Specs API makes these rules available to your integration.\n\nYou can also view the information from this API call as [an online guide](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information).\n\n## [Person](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/create)[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/update)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/retrieve)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/list)[DELETE/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/delete)\n\n## [Transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/transfers)\n\nA `Transfer` object is created when you move funds between Stripe accounts as part of Connect.\n\nBefore April 6, 2017, transfers also represented movement of funds from a Stripe account to a card or bank account. This behavior has since been split out into a [Payout](#payout_object) object, with corresponding payout endpoints. For more information, read about the [transfer/payout split](https://docs.stripe.com/transfer-payout-split).\n\nRelated guide: [Creating separate charges and transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n\n## [Secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/secret_management)\n\nSecret Store is an API that allows Stripe Apps developers to securely persist secrets for use by UI Extensions and app backends.\n\nThe primary resource in Secret Store is a `secret`. Other apps can’t view secrets created by an app. Additionally, secrets are scoped to provide further permission control.\n\nAll Dashboard users and the app backend share `account` scoped secrets. Use the `account` scope for secrets that don’t change per-user, like a third-party API key.\n\nA `user` scoped secret is accessible by the app backend and one specific Dashboard user. Use the `user` scope for per-user secrets like per-user OAuth tokens, where different users might have different permissions.\n\nRelated guide: [Store data between page reloads](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/store-auth-data-custom-objects)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[GET/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/list)[POST/v1/apps/secrets/delete](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/delete)[GET/v1/apps/secrets/find](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/find)[POST/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/set)\n\n## [Reviews](https://docs.stripe.com/api/radar/reviews)\n\nReviews can be used to supplement automated fraud detection with human expertise.\n\nLearn more about [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar) and reviewing payments [here](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/reviews).\n\n## [Authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/update)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/list)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/approve](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/approve)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/decline](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/decline)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_create)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/capture](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_capture)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/expire](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_expire)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/finalize\\_amount](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_finalize_amount)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/increment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_increment)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/fraud\\_challenges/respond](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/respond_to_fraud_challenges)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/reverse](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_reverse)\n\n## [Cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/create)[POST/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/update)[GET/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/list)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/deliver](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_deliver)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/fail](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_fail)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/return](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_return)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/ship](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_ship)\n\n## [Physical Bundles](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/physical_bundles)\n\nA Physical Bundle represents the bundle of physical items - card stock, carrier letter, and envelope - that is shipped to a cardholder when you create a physical card.\n\n## [Reader](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/terminal/readers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/create)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/update)[GET/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/retrieve)[GET/v1/terminal/readers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/list)[DELETE/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/delete)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/cancel\\_action](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/cancel_action)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/collect\\_inputs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/collect_inputs)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/confirm\\_payment\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/confirm_payment_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/collect\\_payment\\_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/collect_payment_method)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/process\\_payment\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/process_payment_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/process\\_setup\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/process_setup_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/refund\\_payment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/refund_payment)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/set\\_reader\\_display](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/set_reader_display)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/terminal/readers/:id/present\\_payment\\_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/present_payment_method)\n\n## [Terminal Hardware Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_products)Preview feature\n\nA TerminalHardwareProduct is a category of hardware devices that are generally similar, but may have variations depending on the country it’s shipped to.\n\nTerminalHardwareSKUs represent variations within the same Product (for example, a country specific device). For example, WisePOS E is a TerminalHardwareProduct and a WisePOS E - US and WisePOS E - UK are TerminalHardwareSKUs.\n\n## [Terminal Hardware SKU](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_skus)Preview feature\n\nA TerminalHardwareSKU represents a SKU for Terminal hardware. A SKU is a representation of a product available for purchase, containing information such as the name, price, and images.\n\n## [Transaction Entries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/transaction_entries)\n\nTransactionEntries represent individual units of money movements within a single [Transaction](#transactions).\n\n## [Scheduled Queries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/sigma/scheduled_queries)\n\nIf you have [scheduled a Sigma query](https://docs.stripe.com/sigma/scheduled-queries), you’ll receive a `sigma.scheduled_query_run.created` webhook each time the query runs. The webhook contains a `ScheduledQueryRun` object, which you can use to retrieve the query results.\n\n## [Report Types](https://docs.stripe.com/api/reporting/report_type)\n\nThe Report Type resource corresponds to a particular type of report, such as the “Activity summary” or “Itemized payouts” reports. These objects are identified by an ID belonging to a set of enumerated values. See [API Access to Reports documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/reporting/statements/api) for those Report Type IDs, along with required and optional parameters.\n\nNote that certain report types can only be run based on your live-mode data (not test-mode data), and will error when queried without a [live-mode API key](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#test-live-modes).\n\n## [Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/financial_connections/sessions)\n\nA Financial Connections Session is the secure way to programmatically launch the client-side Stripe.js modal that lets your users link their accounts.\n\n## [Verification Report](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_reports)\n\nA VerificationReport is the result of an attempt to collect and verify data from a user. The collection of verification checks performed is determined from the `type` and `options` parameters used. You can find the result of each verification check performed in the appropriate sub-resource: `document`, `id_number`, `selfie`.\n\nEach VerificationReport contains a copy of any data collected by the user as well as reference IDs which can be used to access collected images through the [FileUpload](https://docs.stripe.com/api/files) API. To configure and create VerificationReports, use the [VerificationSession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_sessions) API.\n\nRelated guide: [Accessing verification results](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verification-sessions#results).\n\n## [Crypto Onramp Quotes](https://docs.stripe.com/api/crypto/onramp_quotes)\n\nCrypto Onramp Quotes are estimated quotes for onramp conversions into all the different cryptocurrencies on different networks. The Quotes API allows you to display quotes in your product UI before directing the user to the onramp widget.\n\nRelated guide: [Quotes API](https://docs.stripe.com/crypto/quotes-api)\n\n## [Climate Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/climate/product)\n\nA Climate product represents a type of carbon removal unit available for reservation. You can retrieve it to see the current price and availability.\n\n## [Forwarding Request](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/request)\n\nInstructs Stripe to make a request on your behalf using the destination URL. The destination URL is activated by Stripe at the time of onboarding. Stripe verifies requests with your credentials provided during onboarding, and injects card details from the payment\\_method into the request.\n\nStripe redacts all sensitive fields and headers, including authentication credentials and card numbers, before storing the request and response data in the forwarding Request object, which are subject to a 30-day retention period.\n\nYou can provide a Stripe idempotency key to make sure that requests with the same key result in only one outbound request. The Stripe idempotency key provided should be unique and different from any idempotency keys provided on the underlying third-party request.\n\nForwarding Requests are synchronous requests that return a response or time out according to Stripe’s limits.\n\nRelated guide: [Forward card details to third-party API endpoints](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/forwarding).\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/create)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/retrieve)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/list)",
