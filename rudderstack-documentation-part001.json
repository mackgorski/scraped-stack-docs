    "markdown": "# Install JavaScript SDK | RudderStack Docs\n\nInstall and set up the JavaScript SDK v3 on your website.\n\n* * *\n\n*     4 minute read  \n    \n\nThis guide will help you install the JavaScript SDK on your website via [CDN](#using-cdn) or using [NPM](#using-npm).\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> If you are migrating from an older version, see the [Migration Guide](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/migration-guide/) for details.\n\n## Using CDN\n\nFollow these steps to get the JavaScript SDK installation snippet and integrate it in your website.\n\n1.  Go to the **Setup** tab of your JavaScript source in the [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/).\n2.  Click the **Minified** or **Original** tab followed by **Copy snippet**.\n\n[![JavaScript SDK snippet](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/get-started/quickstart/js-sdk-snippet.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/get-started/quickstart/js-sdk-snippet.webp)\n\nTo integrate the SDK with your website and load it **synchronously**, set `scriptLoadingMode` (highlighted below) to `\"\"`.\n\n```\nvar scriptLoadingMode = \"\";\n```\n\n[![JavaScript SDK synchronous installation](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-sources/js-sdk-installation-snippet-unminified.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-sources/js-sdk-installation-snippet-unminified.webp)\n\nTo defer the script loading to the end, set `scriptLoadingMode` to `defer`, as shown:\n\n```\nvar scriptLoadingMode = \"defer\";\n```\n\n4.  Paste the modified script in your website’s `<head>` section.\n\nNote the following:\n\n*   The SDK installation snippet contains both the [write keyThe write key (or source write key) is a unique identifier for your source. RudderStack uses this key to send events from a source to the specified destination.](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/resources/glossary/#write-key) and [data plane URLThe data plane URL is the location where events are routed and sent to the RudderStack backend for processing. You can find this URL in the home page of your RudderStack dashboard.](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/resources/glossary/#data-plane-url) by default.\n*   The implicit `page` call at the end of the snippet (present in the previous JavaScript SDK versions) is removed in the [latest SDK v3](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/breaking-changes/#installation). If required, you need to make a `page` call explicitly, as shown:\n\n*   Depending on the browser, the SDK loads either the legacy or modern JavaScript SDK bundle. The legacy bundle is built for ES5 while the modern bundle (with Module Federation) is built for ES6.\n*   You can also pass your `loadOptions` as a third argument in the `rudderanalytics.load` method. See [Load JavaScript SDK](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/load-js-sdk/) for more information.\n\n### Installation workflow\n\nThe installation code snippets listed above perform the following actions:\n\n1.  Based on browser capabilities, load either the `legacy` or `modern` bundle.\n2.  Load the necessary polyfills for the SDK to load.\n3.  Create an array to store the events until the SDK is ready.\n4.  Store the method invocations in the below table to replay them when the SDK is ready.\n5.  Load the SDK with the specified write key.\n\n| Method | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| [`load`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/load-js-sdk/) | Loads the SDK with the specified [write keyThe write key (or source write key) is a unique identifier for your source. RudderStack uses this key to send events from a source to the specified destination.](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/resources/glossary/#write-key) . |\n| [`identify`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/supported-api/#identify) | Identifies the users, records their traits, and associates them with their actions. |\n| [`page`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/supported-api/#page) | Records your website’s page views along with any other information about the viewed page. |\n| [`track`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/supported-api/#track) | Tracks user events along with the associated properties. |\n| [`alias`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/supported-api/#alias) | Maps new user ID with an old ID. |\n| [`group`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/supported-api/#group) | Links an identified user with a group like a company, organization, or an account. |\n| [`reset`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/supported-api/#reset) | Resets information related to the previously identified user. |\n| [`ready`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/supported-api/#ready-api) | Fired when the SDK has initialized itself and the other third-party native SDK destinations. |\n| [`setAnonymousId`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/supported-api/#overriding-anonymous-id) | Sets the anonymous user ID. |\n| [`startSession`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/session-tracking/manual-session-tracking/) | Starts a new session. |\n| [`endSession`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/session-tracking/manual-session-tracking/) | Resets the current session. |\n\n## Using NPM\n\nWhile using the above snippets to integrate the JavaScript SDK with your website is recommended, you can alternatively use the [NPM module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rudderstack/analytics-js) for packaging RudderStack directly into your project.\n\nTo install the JavaScript SDK via NPM, run the following command:\n\n```\nnpm install @rudderstack/analytics-js --save\n```\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> **Use this NPM module only for browser installation.**\n> \n> To integrate RudderStack with your Node.js apps, see [Node.js SDK documentation](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-node-sdk/)\n\nSince the NPM module exports the related APIs on an already-defined object combined with the Node.js module caching, run the following code snippet **once** and use the exported object throughout your project:\n\n*   **For ECMAScript modules (ESM)**:\n\n```\nimport { RudderAnalytics } from '@rudderstack/analytics-js';\n\nconst rudderAnalytics = new RudderAnalytics();\nrudderAnalytics.load(WRITE_KEY, DATA_PLANE_URL, {});\n  \nexport { rudderAnalytics };\n```\n\n*   **For CJS using the `require` method**:\n\n```\nvar RudderAnalytics = require(\"@rudderstack/analytics-js\");\n\nconst rudderAnalytics = new RudderAnalytics();\nrudderAnalytics.load(WRITE_KEY, DATA_PLANE_URL, {});\n\nexports.rudderAnalytics = rudderAnalytics;\n```\n\n#### SDK imports for bundling tools that process dynamic imports\n\nIf you are using a tool to bundle your application and it is attempting to process the dynamic runtime imports of the dependencies, update your SDK imports from `@rudderstack/analytics-js` to `@rudderstack/analytics-js/bundled` to avoid any issues with dynamic imports failing to find plugin modules.\n\nMost common toolchains like the ones based on webpack, rollup, and vite should not face any issues. If your particular setup/toolchain is affected, contact [RudderStack Support](mailto:support@rudderstack.com).\n\n##### **Usage in Chrome extension**\n\nTo use the JavaScript SDK within a Chrome extension, import the content-script as shown:\n\n```\nimport { RudderAnalytics } from '@rudderstack/analytics-js/content-script';\n```\n\n## Supported browsers\n\nThe JavaScript SDK supports the following browsers and their corresponding versions:\n\n| Browser | Supported Versions |\n| --- | --- |\n| Safari | v7 and above |\n| IE  | v11 and above |\n| Edge | v80 and above |\n| Mozilla Firefox | v47 and above |\n| Chrome | v54 and above |\n| Opera | v43 and above |\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> For unsupported browser versions, try adding browser [polyfills](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Polyfill) to your application for the SDK to work correctly.\n\n## Integration with Chromecast\n\nRudderStack supports integrating the JavaScript SDK with [Google Chromecast](https://store.google.com/in/product/chromecast?hl=en-GB). You can build the web sender app by following [these instructions](https://developers.google.com/cast/docs/web_sender) and adding the JavaScript SDK.\n\nSee [Google Cast developer guide](https://developers.google.com/cast/docs/developers) for more details.\n\nQuestions?

Once created, you can connect and activate them in your RudderStack-supported destinations.\n\nFor example, you can create an audience and send that data to the downstream digital advertising destinations to:\n\n*   Retarget all users from a specific city/state/region to improve repeat sales.\n*   Prompt active customers on your sports website to buy season tickets.\n*   Run campaigns to grow product usage and retain users.\n\n## Key features\n\nRudderStack provides audience-building capabilities in its Reverse ETL pipeline where you can:\n\n*   Create and sync a single audience to multiple downstream systems, which is very time-consuming to do manually.\n*   Analyze the results of multichannel campaigns in a single place at the data warehouse.\n*   Trust the audience data as a single source of truth and have complete control over the ecosystem.\n*   Fast-track the process for marketing teams who would otherwise need to work with SQL and warehouses or rely on data engineers to query and sync audiences.\n*   Avoid updating the audience every time or debugging issues while building audiences using proprietary tools, saving time.\n\n## Create audience\n\nRudderStack provides a visual **Audience builder tool** which you can use to build audiences without any prior knowledge of SQL or how to store the data.\n\n1.  Log in to your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/).\n2.  From the left navigation bar, go to **Activate** > **Audiences** and click **New audience**.\n3.  Configure the settings explained in the following sections:\n\n### Select source\n\nSelect the warehouse source for which you want to create an audience. RudderStack supports the Audiences feature for the following sources:\n\n*   [BigQuery](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/reverse-etl/google-bigquery/)\n*   [Databricks](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/reverse-etl/databricks/)\n*   [Redshift](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/reverse-etl/amazon-redshift/)\n*   [Snowflake](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/reverse-etl/snowflake/)\n*   [Trino](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/reverse-etl/trino/)\n\n### Specify warehouse credentials\n\nSpecify the warehouse credentials to authenticate RudderStack. See the **Configure warehouse credentials** section of the [source-specific documentation](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/reverse-etl/#supported-reverse-etl-sources) (for example, [Redshift](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/reverse-etl/amazon-redshift/#configuring-the-connection-credentials)) for more details.\n\n### Specify audience name and source\n\n*   **Source name**: Assign a name to uniquely identify the source in the RudderStack dashboard.\n    \n*   Configure your audience source by specifying the below fields:\n    \n    *   **Schema**: Select the warehouse schema from the dropdown.\n    *   **Table**: Choose the required table from which RudderStack syncs the data.\n    *   **Primary key**: Select the column from the above table that uniquely identify your records in the warehouse.\n\n### Set audience conditions\n\nYou can set the required filtering conditions, view the corresponding SQL query and preview the resultant data from your data filters:\n\n[![Set conditions in audience](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warehouse-actions-sources/set-condition-audience.gif)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warehouse-actions-sources/set-condition-audience.gif)\n\nYou can add multiple filters within a condition by clicking **Add condition** or add multiple group filters by clicking **Add group condition**. Select **All** or **Any** to implement the AND or OR operator respectively between different filtering conditions.\n\n[![AND/OR conditions in audience](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warehouse-actions-sources/and-or-condition-audience.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warehouse-actions-sources/and-or-condition-audience.webp)\n\nClick **Preview** to see the results and verify if the audience conditions are correct. Click **Continue** to proceed.\n\n### Review and complete setup\n\nTo make any changes to the warehouse credentials or audience configuration, click the edit icon present next to those sections.\n\n[![Edit audience configuration](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/data-pipelines/edit-audience-configuration.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/data-pipelines/edit-audience-configuration.webp)\n\nOnce you have reviewed your configuration, click **Create source** to complete the setup.\n\n### Connect audience to destination\n\nYou can connect this source to an existing or new [destination](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/overview/) to start using it. To connect to a destination later, click **Done** on the top right.\n\n[![Next steps](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/retl-sources/created-source.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/retl-sources/created-source.webp)\n\nYou will then be redirected to the **Overview** page of the source where you get the option of connecting it to an existing or new destination.\n\n[![Add destination](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/retl-sources/add-destination.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/retl-sources/add-destination.webp)\n\nSee [Set up Reverse ETL Connection](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/reverse-etl/retl-connection-setup/) section for more information.\n\n## Update audience\n\n1.  Go to the **Configuration** tab of the audience source.\n2.  Click the edit icon in the **Configuration settings** to update the source configuration and audience description\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> Note that:\n> \n> *   You can update the **Schema** and **Table** fields only if your audience source is **not** connected to any destination. Otherwise, you can only update the **Primary key** and **Description**.\n> *   Your audience conditions will be reset if you change the warehouse schema or table.\n\n[![Update audience](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/data-pipelines/update-audience-1.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/data-pipelines/update-audience-1.webp)\n\nTo update the audience conditions, click the **Edit conditions** button and update the conditions.

However, you can change it as required.\n\n[![Audience identifier](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warehouse-actions-sources/audience-identifier.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warehouse-actions-sources/audience-identifier.webp)\n\nRudderStack sets the user traits with the provided **Audience identifier** as the key. It sets the value of the trait to either `true` or `false` depending on whether the user is a member of the defined audience.\n\n## Supported destinations\n\nYou can connect an audience to the following destinations:\n\n*   [ActiveCampaign](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/activecampaign/)\n*   [Bing Ads Audience](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/reverse-etl-destinations/bing-ads-audience/)\n*   [Braze](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/braze/)\n*   [Criteo Audience](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/reverse-etl-destinations/criteo-audience/)\n*   [Customer.io](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/customer.io/)\n*   [Facebook Custom Audience](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/reverse-etl-destinations/fb-custom-audience/)\n*   [Google Ads Remarketing Lists (Customer Match)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/reverse-etl-destinations/google-adwords-remarketing-list/)\n*   [Heap.io](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/heap.io/)\n*   [HubSpot](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/hubspot/)\n*   [Intercom](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/intercom/)\n*   [Iterable](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/iterable/)\n*   [Klaviyo](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/klaviyo/)\n*   [LaunchDarkly Segments](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/reverse-etl-destinations/launchdarkly-segments/)\n*   [Marketo](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/marketo/)\n*   [Marketo Static Lists](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/reverse-etl-destinations/marketo-static-lists/)\n*   [Salesforce](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/salesforce/)\n*   [SendGrid](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/sendgrid/)\n*   [The Trade Desk Audience](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/reverse-etl-destinations/trade-desk-audience/)\n*   [TikTok Audiences](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/reverse-etl-destinations/tiktok-audiences/)\n*   [Webhook](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/webhooks/)\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### Can I create a filter on the JSON columns in my warehouse table?\n\nYes, you can. Select the **Custom SQL filter** option from the dropdown and enter the corresponding SQL query, which includes the relevant filtering condition for the JSON column:\n\n[![Connect audience](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warehouse-actions-sources/custom-sql-filter.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warehouse-actions-sources/custom-sql-filter.webp)\n\n#### **What do the three validations under Verifying Credentials imply?**\n\nOnce you proceed after entering the connection credentials, you will see the following validations under the **Verifying Credentials** option:\n\n[![Validating credentials](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/retl-sources/retl-credentials-validate.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/retl-sources/retl-credentials-validate.webp)\n\nThese options are explained below:\n\n*   **Verifying Connection**: Indicates that RudderStack is trying to connect to the warehouse with the information specified in the connection credentials.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> If this option gives an error, it means that one or more fields specified in the connection credentials are incorrect. Verify your credentials in this case.\n\n*   **Able to List Schema**: Checks if RudderStack is able to fetch all schema details using the provided credentials.\n    \n*   **Able to Access RudderStack Schema**: Checks if RudderStack has the required access to the `_RUDDERSTACK` / `_rudderstack` schema (depending on your warehouse). To create the schema, run all commands listed in the **Permissions** section of the respective Reverse ETL source documentation:\n    \n    *   [BigQuery](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/reverse-etl/google-bigquery/#granting-permissions)\n    *   [Databricks](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/reverse-etl/databricks/#granting-permissions)\n    *   [PostgreSQL](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/reverse-etl/postgresql/#granting-permissions)\n    *   [Redshift](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/reverse-etl/amazon-redshift/#granting-permissions)\n    *   [Snowflake](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/reverse-etl/snowflake/#granting-permissions)\n    *   [Trino](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/reverse-etl/trino/#granting-permissions)\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> If this option gives an error, verify if you have successfully created the `_RUDDERSTACK` / `_rudderstack` schema and given RudderStack the required permissions to access it.\n\nQuestions?

    "markdown": "# JavaScript SDK APIs | RudderStack Docs\n\nSend events by leveraging different JavaScript SDK APIs.\n\n* * *\n\n*     10 minute read  \n    \n\nThe JavaScript SDK provides a comprehensive API that lets you track and send your event data to any destination.\n\n## Identify\n\nThe [`identify`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/identify/) method lets you identify a user and associate them to their actions. It also lets you record any traits about them like their name, email, etc.\n\nOnce you make the `identify` call, the SDK persists the user information and passes it to the subsequent calls.\n\nThe JavaScript SDK defines the `identify` method as shown:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify(userId, [traits], [apiOptions], [callback]);\n```\n\nThe following table describes the above (optional) parameters in detail:\n\n| Parameter | Type | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `userId` | String | The unique user identifier in the database. When provided, the SDK sends this argument to the destinations instead of `anonymousId`. |\n| `traits` | Dictionary | Contains the user’s traits or the properties associated with `userId` such as email, address, etc. See [Identify traits](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/identify/#identify-traits) for more information. |\n| `apiOptions` | Dictionary | Provides information such as `integrations`, `anonymousId`, and `originalTimestamp`. |\n| `callback` | Function | Called after the successful execution of the `identify` method. |\n\n#### `apiOptions` structure\n\nThe structure of the **apiOptions** parameter is as shown:\n\n```\n{\n  integrations: IntegrationOpts,\n  anonymousId: string,\n  originalTimestamp: ISO 8601 date string,\n  <other keys>: <value> // merged with event's contextual information\n}\n```\n\nThe following table describes the above parameters in detail:\n\n| **Parameter** | **Type** | **Description** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `integrations` | [IntegrationOpts](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/load-js-sdk/#integrationopts) | Use to send event data only to the [selective destinations](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/filtering/). |\n| `anonymousId` | String | Overrides the current event’s `anonymousId` at the top level. |\n| `originalTimestamp` | ISO 8601 Date string | Overrides the current event’s `originalTimestamp` at the top level. See [Clock skew considerations](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/common-fields/#clock-skew-considerations) for more information. |\n| `<other keys>: <value>` | \\-  | Merged with the event’s contextual information. |\n\nA sample `identify` call is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify(\n  \"1hKOmRA4el9Zt1WSfVJIVo4GRlm\", {\n    firstName: \"Alex\",\n    lastName: \"Keener\",\n    email: \"alex@example.com\",\n    phone: \"+1-202-555-0146\"\n  }, {\n    page: {\n      path: \"/best-seller/1\",\n      referrer: \"https://www.google.com/search?q=estore+bestseller\",\n      search: \"estore bestseller\",\n      title: \"The best sellers offered by EStore\",\n      url: \"https://www.estore.com/best-seller/1\"\n    }\n  },\n  () => {\n    console.log(\"identify call\");\n  }\n);\n```\n\nIn the above example, the JavaScript SDK captures the `userId`, `email` and the [contextual information](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/common-fields/#contextual-fields).\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> If you specify the IP address in the event payload, RudderStack uses that instead of automatically capturing it in the backend. You can use this feature to anonymize your users’ IP addresses.\n\n### Anonymous ID\n\nThe `anonymousId` is an auto-generated **UUID** (Universally Unique Identifier) that gets assigned to each unique and unidentified visitor to your website.\n\n#### **Retrieving anonymous ID**\n\nTo retrieve the anonymous ID of any visitor, run the following:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.getAnonymousId();\n```\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> If the `anonymousId` is `null` in the SDK and you call the above function, RudderStack will automatically set a new `anonymousId`.\n\n#### **How the SDK uses `anonymousId`**\n\nThe JavaScript SDK generates a unique `anonymousId`, stores it in the `rl_anonymous_id` cookie in the top-level domain, and attaches it to every subsequent event. This helps RudderStack to identify the anonymous users from other sites hosted under a sub-domain.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> If you identify a user with your application’s unique identifier like email, database ID, etc., RudderStack stores this ID in the `rl_user_id` cookie and attaches it to every event.\n\nRefer to the [Data Storage](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/data-storage-cookies/) guide for more information on how the JavaScript SDK stores persistent user data in cookies.\n\n#### **Overriding anonymous ID**\n\nYou can use any of the following three methods to override the `anonymousId` generated by the JavaScript SDK:\n\n*   Provide the `anonymousId` in the **apiOptions** parameter of the `identify` call.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Note that all other events will have the `anonymousId` persisted from the cookie except the particular event where you override the **apiOptions** parameter.\n\nAn example is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify(\n  \"1hKOmRA4el9Zt1WSfVJIVo4GRlm\", {\n    email: \"alex@example.com\"\n  }, {\n    anonymousId: \"my-anonymous-id\"\n  },\n  () => {\n    console.log(\"identify call\");\n  }\n);\n```\n\n*   Set the `anonymousId` for all future events using the `setAnonymousId()` method. An example is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.setAnonymousId(\"my-anonymous-id\");\n// All event payloads will have the anonymousId key set \"my-anonymous-id\".\nrudderanalytics.identify(\"1hKOmRA4el9Zt1WSfVJIVo4GRlm\", {\n  email1: \"alex@example.com\"\n}, () => {\n  console.log(\"identify call\");\n});\n```\n\n*   Parse the AMP Linker ID and set the `anonymousId` using AMP Analytics:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.setAnonymousId(\n  null,\n  \"<version>*<checkSum>*<idName1>*<idValue1>*<idName2>*<idValue2>...\"\n);\n```\n\nHere, the second parameter is the AMP Linker ID format in the [specified structure](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/extensions/amp-analytics/linker-id-receiving.md#format). For websites using the [RudderStack AMP Analytics SDK](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-amp-analytics/#amp-linker), the `<idName1>` value will be `rs_amp_id`.\n\nCalling the above method will parse the Linker ID and set the `rs_amp_id` key value as the `anonymousId`.\n\n### Setting a blank user ID\n\nTo set a blank user ID, you can pass an empty string or `\" \"` to `userId`.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> Do not pass an `identify` call with `null` as RudderStack will not allow you to pass a traits object and retain the current `userId`.\n\n#### Use case\n\nSuppose an anonymous user is identified with a `userId` and then logs out of their account. You can then call `identify(\"\", {isLoggedIn: false})` and the user will continue to be identified by their `anonymousId` for the future events.\n\n### Identifying new users\n\nTo identify new users in scenarios like new logins, you can use any one of the following approaches:\n\n*   Call `identify` with a new `userId`  \n    OR\n*   Call `reset` followed by the `identify`\n\nRudderStack resets all cookies related to the user (associated with the `userId` and `traits`) and updates them with the newly provided values.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> The `anonymousId` will remain unchanged in this case. It will be the auto-generated value set by the SDK or the one explicitly set using the `setAnonymousId` method.\n\n### Updating user traits\n\nFor updating the user traits, you can call `identify` method with the same `userId` multiple times with the new traits. This will append or modify all traits associated with that user. An example is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify(\"1hKOmRA4el9Zt1WSfVJIVo4GRlm\", {\n    email1: \"alex@example.com\"\n}, () => {\n    console.log(\"identify call\");\n});\n\nrudderanalytics.identify(\"1hKOmRA4el9Zt1WSfVJIVo4GRlm\", {\n    email2: \"john@example.com\"\n}, () => {\n    console.log(\"identify call\");\n});\n```\n\nIn the above example, both `email1` and `email2` will be sent in the payload for the second `identify` call.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Calling `reset()` method resets the existing user traits and calling `identify()` method with new traits updates the new user traits.\n\n### Setting a custom user ID\n\nYou can pass a custom `userId` along with the standard `userId` in your `identify` call. RudderStack adds this value under `context.externalId`.\n\nThe following code snippet highlights how you can add an `externalId` to your `identify` request:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify(\n  \"1hKOmRA4GRlm\", {\n    firstName: \"Alex\",\n    city: \"New Orleans\",\n    country: \"Louisiana\",\n    phone: \"+1-202-555-0146\",\n    email: \"alex@example.com\",\n    custom_flavor: \"chocolate\",\n  } {\n    externalId: [{\n      id: \"some_external_id_1\",\n      type: \"brazeExternalId\",\n    }, ],\n  }\n);\n```\n\n## Page\n\nThe [`page`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/page/) call lets you record your website’s page views with any additional relevant information about the viewed page.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Many destinations require the `page` call to be made at least once every page load.\n\nThe JavaScript SDK defines the `page` method as shown:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.page(category, name, [properties], [apiOptions], [callback]);\n```\n\nThe following table describes the above (optional) parameters in detail:\n\n| **Parameter** | **Type** | **Description** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `category` | String | Category of the page. |\n| `name` | String | Name of the page. |\n| `properties` | Dictionary | Properties of the page auto-captured by the SDK. |\n| `apiOptions` | Dictionary | Provides information such as `integrations`, `anonymousId`, and `originalTimestamp`. [Reference](#apioptions). |\n| `callback` | Function | Called after the successful execution of `page` method. |\n\nA sample `page` call is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.page(\n  \"Cart\",\n  \"Cart Viewed\", {\n    path: \"/best-seller/1\",\n    referrer: \"https://www.google.com/search?q=estore+bestseller\",\n    search: \"estore bestseller\",\n    title: \"The best sellers offered by EStore\",\n    url: \"https://www.estore.com/best-seller/1\"\n  },\n  () => {\n    console.log(\"page call\");\n  }\n);\n```\n\nIn the above example, the JavaScript SDK captures the page `category`, `name` and the [contextual information](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/common-fields/#contextual-fields).\n\n## Track\n\nThe [`track`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/track/) call lets you capture user events along with the associated properties.\n\nThe JavaScript SDK defines the `track` method as shown:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(event, [properties], [apiOptions], [callback]);\n```\n\nThe following table describes the above parameters in detail:\n\n| **Parameter** | **Type** | **Presence** | **Description** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `event` | String | Required | The name of the tracked event. |\n| `properties` | Dictionary | Optional | The event-related properties. |\n| `apiOptions` | Dictionary | Optional | Provides information such as `integrations`, `anonymousId`, and `originalTimestamp`. [Reference](#apioptions). |\n| `callback` | Function | Optional | Called after the successful execution of the `track` call. |\n\nA sample `track` call is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\n  \"Order Completed\", {\n    revenue: 30,\n    currency: \"USD\",\n    user_actual_id: 12345\n  },\n  () => {\n    console.log(\"track call\");\n  }\n);\n```\n\nIn the above example, the `track` method tracks the `Order Completed` event along with other information like `revenue`, `currency`, and the `user_actual_id`.\n\nRefer to the [Ecommerce Events Specification](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/ecommerce-events-spec/) for more information on the ecommerce events captured by RudderStack.\n\n## Alias\n\nThe [`alias`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/alias/) call lets you merge different identities of a known user.\n\nThe JavaScript SDK defines the `alias` method as shown:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.alias(to, from, [apiOptions], [callback]);\n```\n\nThe following table describes the above parameters in detail:\n\n| **Parameter** | **Type** | **Presence** | **Description** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `to` | String | Required | New user identifier. |\n| `from` | String | Optional | Old user identifier which will be an alias for the `to` parameter. If not provided, the SDK populates this as the currently identified `userId`, or `anonymousId` in case of anonymous users. |\n| `apiOptions` | Dictionary | Optional | Provides information such as `integrations`, `anonymousId`, and `originalTimestamp`. [Reference](#apioptions). |\n| `callback` | Function | Optional | Called after the successful execution of the `alias` call. |\n\nA sample `alias` call is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.alias(\"new_id\", \"old_id\", () => {\n  console.log(\"alias call\");\n});\n```\n\n## Group\n\nThe [`group`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/group/) call lets you associate an identified user with a group such as a company, organization, or an account.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack does not support associating a user to more than one group per `group` call.\n\nThe JavaScript SDK defines the `group` method as shown:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.group(groupId, [traits], [apiOptions], [callback]);\n```\n\nThe following table describes the above parameters in detail:\n\n| **Parameter** | **Type** | **Presence** | **Description** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `groupId` | String | Required | The unique group identifier in the database. RudderStack calls the relevant destination APIs to associate the identified user to this group. |\n| `traits` | Dictionary | Optional | The group-related traits. RudderStack passes these traits to the destination to enhance the group properties. |\n| `apiOptions` | Dictionary | Optional | Provides information such as `integrations`, `anonymousId`, and `originalTimestamp`. [Reference](#apioptions). |\n| `callback` | Function | Optional | Called after the successful execution of the `group` call. |\n\nA sample `group` call is shown:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.group(\"sample_group_id\", {\n  name: \"Apple Inc.\",\n  location: \"USA\",\n});\n```\n\n## Reset\n\nThe `reset` method resets the ID and traits of both the user and the group.\n\nIn [session tracking](https://rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/session-tracking/#:~:text=tracking%20is%20enabled%3A-,sessionId,-%28Number%29%3A%20The%20session), calling the `reset` method clears the current `sessionId` and generates a new one.\n\nThe JavaScript SDK defines the `reset` method as shown:\n\nYou can also reset the `anonymousId` along with the above-mentioned details by passing `true` to the `reset()` method:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.reset(true);\n```\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> The `reset()` method only clears the [cookies and local storage](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/data-storage-cookies/) set by RudderStack. It does not clear the information stored by the integrated destinations.\n\n## `ready` API\n\nThe JavaScript SDK exposes a `ready` API with a callback parameter that fires when the SDK has initialized itself and the other third-party destination SDKs.\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.ready(() => {\n  console.log('We are all set!!!');\n});\n```\n\nYou can use this API in cases where you want to tap into the features provided by the end-destination SDKs to enhance user tracking and other functionalities.\n\n## Querystring API\n\nRudderStack’s Querystring API lets you trigger the `track` and `identify` calls using the query parameters within the URL. The query parameters are listed in the following table:\n\n| Parameter | Action |\n| --- | --- |\n| `ajs_uid` | Triggers a `rudderanalytics.identify()` call with `userId` having the parameter value. |\n| `ajs_aid` | Triggers a `rudderanalytics.setAnonymousId()` call with `anonymousId` having the parameter value. |\n| `ajs_event` | Triggers a `rudderanalytics.track()` call with `event` name as the parameter value. |\n| `ajs_prop_<property>` | If `ajs_event` is passed as a query string, the value of this parameter populates the `properties` of the corresponding event in the `track` call. |\n| `ajs_trait_<trait>` | If `ajs_uid` is provided as a query string, the value of this parameter populates the `traits` of the `identify` call. |\n\nFor example, consider the following URL containing the query string parameters:\n\n`http://hostname.com/?ajs_uid=12345&ajs_event=test%20event&ajs_aid=abcde&ajs_prop_testProp=prop1&ajs_trait_name=Firstname+Lastname`\n\nIt will trigger the following API calls:\n\n```\n// Sets the user ID/anonymous ID\nrudderanalytics.setAnonymousId(\"abcde\");\n\n// Identify call\nrudderanalytics.identify(\"12345\", {\n  name: \"Firstname Lastname\"\n});\n\n// Track call\nrudderanalytics.track(\"test event\", {\n  testProp: \"prop1\"\n});\n```\n\n## Context and traits\n\nThe JavaScript SDK automatically captures certain event-specific and user-specific data based on the event type.\n\nThe `context` and `traits` dictionaries are provided in the [apiOptions](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/supported-api/#apioptions) parameter of the supported API methods.\n\n### Context\n\nThe `context` object is a dictionary of additional information about a particular event data, such as a user’s locale.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> A context is a complete and specific piece of information. Any other information provided outside this specification is ignored.\n\n### Traits\n\nThe `traits` object is an optional dictionary included within [`context`](#context) specifying the user’s unique traits. This is a very useful field for linking the user’s information from a previously made [`identify`](#identify) call to the subsequent calls, for example, [`track`](#track) or [`page`](#page).\n\n#### Use-case\n\nTo understand the concept of context and traits better, refer to the following `identify` event:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify(\"1hKOmRA4el9Zt1WSfVJIVo4GRlm\", {\n  name: \"Alex Keener\",\n  email: \"alex@example.com\",\n  subscriptionStatus: \"subscribed\",\n  plan: \"Silver\"\n});\n```\n\nThe traits in the above event are `name`, `email`, `subscriptionStatus`, and `plan`. If you wish to add or override any traits in the subsequent `track` or `page` event triggered by the user, you can do so by passing it in `traits` as shown:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\n  \"Subscription Update\", {\n    campaign: \"Subscribe\"\n  }, {\n    traits: {\n      plan: \"Gold\",\n      addOn: true\n    }\n  }\n);\n```\n\nThe above snippet will add a new trait `addOn` and update the user trait `plan` to `Gold`.\n\nQuestions?

    "markdown": "# Data Persistence in JavaScript SDK\n\nUnderstand how our JavaScript SDK persists user data stored in cookies or local storage.\n\n* * *\n\n*     4 minute read  \n    \n\nThe JavaScript SDK stores persistent user data in the cookies by default. If the cookies are not supported, the SDK uses local storage instead.\n\nBy default, the SDK stores all cookies in the top-level domain. It helps you to identify the users visiting websites hosted under a particular sub-domain. For example, if you include the JavaScript SDK in both `admin.samplewebsite.com` and `app.samplewebsite.com`, the SDK will store the cookie in `samplewebsite.com`. However, you can specify the cookie storage location by using the `setCookieDomain` parameter in the [`load`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/load-js-sdk/) API options as shown:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.load(WRITE_KEY, DATA_PLANE_URL, {\n  setCookieDomain: \"samplewebsite.com\",\n});\n```\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n\n## Cookies\n\nThe cookie values are encrypted and their length is directly proportional to the values provided to the SDK. Also, all cookie names are prefixed with `rl_` and the values are prefixed with `RudderEncrypt:`. For example, `rl_user_id —> RudderEncrypt:U2FsdGVkX1+UKmiooYoGmKdNws7sgmWgGfHe`.\n\nThe following table lists the cookies used by the JavaScript SDK to store persistent user data:\n\n| Name | Description | Clearing mechanism  <br>using the SDK |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `rl_user_id` | Stores the user ID set via the `identify` API. All the subsequent event payloads will contain this data unless cleared from the storage.<br><br>For example: `4578`, `USER_001` | `rudderanalytics.reset()` |\n| `rl_trait` | Stores the user traits object set via the `identify` API. All the subsequent event payloads will contain this data unless cleared from the storage.<br><br>For example:<br><br>{  <br>  email: “[alex@example.com](mailto:alex@example.com)”,  <br>  accountType: “pro”,  <br>  country: “US”,  <br>  someObj: {  <br>    key1: val1,  <br>    key2: val2,  <br>  }  <br>} | `rudderanalytics.reset()` |\n| `rl_anonymous_id` | Stores the anonymous ID. By default, it would be the auto-generated unique ID by SDK for each visitor unless overridden via `setAnonymousId` API. All the subsequent event payloads will contain this data unless cleared from the storage.<br><br>For example: `5bfe258f-bd2f-49cf-bddd-8b844f74ab4b`, `customAnonId` | `rudderanalytics.reset(true)` |\n| `rl_group_id` | Stores the user group ID set via the `group` API. All the subsequent group event payloads will contain this data unless cleared from the storage.<br><br>For example: `GRP_3`, `98` | `rudderanalytics.reset()` |\n| `rl_group_trait` | Stores the user group traits object set via the `group` API. All the subsequent group event payloads will contain this data unless cleared from the storage.<br><br>For example:<br><br>{  <br>  location: “New Orleans”,  <br>  nationality: “US”,  <br>  someObj: {  <br>    key1: val1,  <br>    key2: val2,  <br>  }  <br>} | `rudderanalytics.reset()` |\n| `rl_page_init_referrer` | Stores the initial referrer of the page when a user visits a site for the first time. All the subsequent event payloads will contain this data.<br><br>For example: `https://www.google.com/` | Cannot be cleared using SDK. |\n| `rl_page_init_referring_domain` | Stores the initial referring domain of the page when a user visits a site for the first time. All the subsequent event payloads will contain this data.<br><br>For example: `google.com` | Cannot be cleared using SDK. |\n| `test_rudder_cookie` | Checks whether the cookie storage of a browser is accessible or not. Once checked, the SDK removes the cookie immediately.<br><br>For example: `test_rudder_cookie:true` | Cleared automatically. |\n| `rl_session` | Stores the session-related information including `sessionId` if session tracking is enabled.<br><br>For example: `1678961874` | Manual session tracking: `rudderanalytics.endSession()`<br><br>Automatic session tracking: Automatically cleared by the SDK (if `autoTrack`: `false`). |\n| `rl_auth_token` | Stores the authentication token passed by the user.<br><br>For example: `MOx2ZmMwLNE2A2IdNKL0N2VhN2I3Z` | `rudderanalytics.reset()` |\n\n## Local storage\n\nRudderStack stores the local storage cookie names with `rudder.<uuid>.` prefix where `uuid` is in the standard UUID v4 format. For example, `rudder.2dc2aee6-2836-4273-be69-79c90c04ddec.reclaimEnd`.\n\nThe JavaScript SDK uses local storage to keep track of the events sent to the RudderStack backend, as listed in the below table:\n\n| Name | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `ack` | Timer for other browser tabs to claim control of the retry queue.  <br>For example, `1639734070124` |\n| `reclaimStart` and `reclaimEnd` | Determines if a tab takes over the queue from another tab.  <br>For example, `2dc2aee6-2836-4273-be69-79c90c04ddec` |\n| `inProgress` | Keeps track of the events in progress. For example:  <br><br>{  <br>  “d89d7fb5-945e-4378-bda5-492e4b596fb4”: {  <br>   “item”: {  <br>    “url”: “[https://rudderstack-dataplane.rudderstack.com/v1/track\"](https://rudderstack-dataplane.rudderstack.com/v1/track%22),  <br>    “headers”: {  <br>     “Content-Type”: “application/json”,  <br>      …  <br>    },  <br>    “message”: {   <br>     …  <br>    }  <br>    “attemptNumber”: 1,  <br>    “time”: 1639734792773,  <br>    “id”: “a4d89d7f-b594-4eb3-b8bd-a5492e4b596f”  <br>   }  <br>  }  <br>} |\n| `queue` | Keeps track of the events that are in the processing queue. For example:  <br><br>\\[  <br>  {  <br>   “item”: {  <br>    “url”: “https://rudderstack-dataplane.rudderstack.com/v1/track”,  <br>    “headers”: {  <br>     “Content-Type”: “application/json”,  <br>      …  <br>    },  <br>    “message”: {   <br>     …  <br>    }  <br>    “attemptNumber”: 0,  <br>    “time”: 1639734792773,  <br>    “id”: “a4d89d7f-b594-4eb3-b8bd-a5492e4b596f”  <br>   }  <br>  }  <br>\\] |\n\nQuestions?

    "markdown": "# Load JavaScript SDK | RudderStack Docs\n\nUnderstand the different SDK load options.\n\n* * *\n\n*     20 minute read  \n    \n\nYou can load the JavaScript SDK using the `load` API method to track and send events from your website to RudderStack.\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.load(WRITE_KEY, DATA_PLANE_URL, [loadOptions]);\n```\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n\n## Loading options\n\nYou can use the `loadOptions` object in the above `load` call to define various options while loading the SDK. It includes the following **optional** parameters:\n\n| Parameter | Type | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `logLevel` | String | Values include `LOG`, `INFO`, `DEBUG`, `WARN`, `ERROR`, and `NONE`.<br><br>**Default value**: `ERROR` |\n| `integrations` | [IntegrationOpts](#integrationopts) | Sends event data to the [selective destinations](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/filtering/). |\n| `configUrl` | String | The [control plane](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/resources/rudderstack-architecture/#control-plane) endpoint serving your destination configurations.<br><br>**Default value**: `https://api.rudderstack.com`.  <br>Note that the SDK automatically appends `/sourceConfig` at the end if it is missing, for example, `<configURL>/sourceConfig`. |\n| [`getSourceConfig`](#getsourceconfig) | Function | Returns custom configuration data to use instead of making a request to the control plane. |\n| `queueOpts` | [QueueOpts](#queueopts) | Contains the options to control the behavior of the persistence queue that buffers the events before sending them to the data plane. |\n| `loadIntegration` | Boolean | Determines whether to load the native destination SDKs. Supported for [Amplitude](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/amplitude/) and [Google Analytics](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/google-analytics-ga/) destinations only. If set to `false`, the SDK assumes that the destination SDK is already loaded on your site and proceeds to initialize and forward data to it.<br><br>**Default value**: `true` |\n| `sessions` | [SessionOpts](#sessionopts) | Captures the details specific to session tracking. |\n| `destSDKBaseURL` | String | URL used by the SDK to load its integration SDKs.<br><br>**Default value**: The CDN path or automatically determined based on core SDK URL. |\n| `useBeacon` | Boolean | Determines whether the SDK [sends event payloads via the Beacon transport mechanism](#send-events-using-beacon).<br><br>**Default value**: `false`. |\n| `beaconQueueOptions` | [BeaconQueueOpts](#send-events-using-beacon) | Controls the behavior of the queue that buffers events before sending them through the Beacon utility in batches. The SDK lets you configure these batching options. |\n| `consentManagement` | Object | See [Consent manager integration](#consent-management) for more information. |\n| `anonymousIdOptions` | Object | [Automatically captures the anonymous ID](#anonymousidoptions) from a source and sets it as RudderStack’s `anonymousId`. |\n| `lockIntegrationsVersion` | Boolean | Determines if the SDK should use the same version of the integration SDKs from CDN as the core SDK. This is particularly useful for [NPM installations](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/quickstart/#using-npm) where a specific version of the core SDK is used.<br><br>**Default value**: `false`, meaning the SDK uses the latest versions of the integration SDKs from the CDN. You can override this parameter by using the `destSDKBaseURL` option. |\n| `lockPluginsVersion` | Boolean | Determines if the SDK should use the same version of the plugins from CDN as the core SDK. This is particularly useful for [NPM installations](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/quickstart/#using-npm) where users want to be shielded from any unexpected breaking changes introduced by any latest CDN releases.<br><br>**Default value**: `false`, meaning the SDK uses the latest version of the plugins from the CDN. You can override this parameter by using the `pluginsSDKBaseURL` option. |\n| `polyfillIfRequired` | Boolean | Loads the polyfills for unsupported features in older browsers.<br><br>**Default value**: `true`. |\n| [`onLoaded`](#onloaded) | Function | Callback function that executes after the SDK loads and before the device mode destination SDKs are loaded. |\n| [`uaChTrackLevel`](#uachtracklevel) | String | Configures the level of information captured in the `context` object. The SDK fetches this information using the [user-agent client hints API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/User-Agent_Client_Hints_API). |\n| `sendAdblockPage` | Boolean | Enables the SDK to detect if the current page is ad-blocked and send an automatic page event. See [Detect Ad-blocked Pages](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/detecting-adblocked-pages/) for more information.<br><br>**Default value**: `false`. |\n| `sendAdblockPageOptions` | Object | If `sendAdblockPage` is set to true, the SDK makes an implicit `page` call about the ad-blocked pages. You can then use this option to specify destinations to which you want to forward this `page` call. See [Detect Ad-blocked Pages](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/detecting-adblocked-pages/) for more information. |\n| [`useGlobalIntegrationsConfigInEvents`](#useglobalintegrationsconfiginevents) | Boolean | Lets you automatically use the [`integrations`](#integrationopts) object specified in the `load` API at the individual event level.<br><br>**Default value**: `false` |\n| `sameDomainCookiesOnly` | Boolean | Determines whether the SDK should read cookies from the exact domain it is set at.<br><br>**Default value**: `false`<br><br>If this load option is set to `true`, then the cookies set from the site’s top-level domain are not accessible by the sub-domains and vice versa. |\n| `pluginsSDKBaseURL` | String | Base URL path used by SDK to load the plugins.<br><br>**Default value**: Standard CDN path or automatically determined from the core SDK location. |\n| `destinationsQueueOptions` | Object | See [`destinationsQueueOptions`](#destinationsqueueoptions) for more information. |\n| `plugins` | String array | List of plugins you want the SDK to load.<br><br>See [Plugins](#plugins) for more information.<br><br>**Default value**: Array of all the plugins names. |\n| `polyfillURL` | String | URL to load polyfills from, not necessarily from the default polyfills service.<br><br>**Default value**: `https://polyfill-fastly.io/v3/polyfill.min.js` with dynamic calculation of missing features from the browser.<br><br>**Example**: Suppose your browser is missing the following features required by the SDK:<br><br>*   `Array.includes`<br>*   `String.startsWith`<br>*   `Promise`<br><br>Then the polyfill URL will look like this (not exactly):  <br>`https://polyfill-fastly.io/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=Array.prototype.includes%2CString.prototype.startsWith%2CPromise.` |\n| `storage` | Object | Configures different storage-related features like, encryption, migration, etc.<br><br>See [Storage](#storage) for more information. |\n| `consentManagement` | Object | Lets you specify the consent management preferences. |\n| `externalAnonymousIdCookieName` | String | Name of the cookie for the SDK to fetch the anonymous ID and use it as RudderStack’s `anonymousId`.<br><br>See [`externalAnonymousIdCookieName`](#destinationsqueueoptions) for more information. |\n\nThe following snippet highlights some basic and commonly configured `load` options. Note that it **does not** include all the `load` options.\n\n```\n{\n  logLevel: 'DEBUG',\n  integrations: {\n    All: true,\n    \"Google Analytics 4\": false\n  },\n  queueOptions: {\n    maxItems: 200,\n    maxAttempts: 15\n  },\n  useBeacon: true,\n  beaconQueueOptions: {\n    maxItems: 50,\n    flushInterval: 60000 // 1 minute\n  },\n  consentManagement: {\n    enabled: true,\n    provider: 'oneTrust'\n  },\n  onLoaded: () => {\n    console.log('RudderStack JavaScript SDK loaded successfully')\n  },\n  uaChTrackLevel: \"full\",\n  sendAdblockPage: true\n}\n```\n\nThe following sections contain the detailed definitions and usage of some of the above parameters:\n\n#### **Integration options**\n\nYou can use this parameter to [filter your event data](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/filtering/) to selective destinations in the following scenarios:\n\n*   Filter destinations while loading the JavaScript SDK.\n*   Sending events to specific destinations at the event level.\n\nThe structure of the `integrations` object is shown:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.load(WRITE_KEY, DATA_PLANE_URL, {\n  integrations: {\n    All: boolean, // default true\n    <Destination1>: boolean, // specify destination like Google Analytics, Amplitude etc.\n    <Destination2>: boolean, // specify destination like Google Analytics, Amplitude etc.\n    ...\n  }\n});\n```\n\nThe following table describes the above (optional) parameters in detail:\n\n| **Parameter** | **Type** | **Description** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `All` | Boolean | All destinations to which the event data must be sent. The default value is `true`. If set to `false`, RudderStack will not send the event data to any destination. |\n| `<Destination>` | Boolean | Specific destination to which the event data must be sent/not, depending on its Boolean value. |\n\nYou **must** specify the actual destination name (as listed in the [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/directory)) in the `<Destination>` parameter and **not** the name you have assigned to the destination. For example, the below sample snippet sends the event data only to **Google Analytics** and **Intercom** destinations:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.load(WRITE_KEY, DATA_PLANE_URL, {\n    integrations: {\n        All: false,\n        \"Google Analytics\": true,\n        \"Intercom\": true\n    }\n});\n```\n\n#### **Get source configuration**\n\nThe `getSourceConfig` function returns a custom configuration that can be used in place of your [open source control plane’s](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/get-started/rudderstack-open-source/control-plane-lite/) dashboard configuration:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.load(WRITE_KEY, DATA_PLANE_URL, {\n  getSourceConfig: function() {\n    return {\n      // custom configuration\n    };\n  },\n  // other load options\n});\n```\n\n#### **Queue options**\n\nThe `queueOpts` object contains the options to control the behavior of the persistence queue that buffers the events before sending them to RudderStack. Its structure is defined as follows:\n\n```\n{\n  maxRetryDelay: 360000,\n  minRetryDelay: 1000,\n  backoffFactor: 2,\n  backoffJitter: 0,\n  maxAttempts: 10,\n  maxItems: 100,\n  batch: {\n    enabled: true,\n    maxItems: 100,\n    maxSize: 512 * 1024, // 512 KB\n    flushInterval: 60000 // In ms\n  },\n}\n```\n\nThe following table describes the above `integer` type (optional) parameters in detail:\n\n| Parameter | Description | Default value |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `maxRetryDelay` | Upper limit on the maximum delay (in ms) between each retries of an event. | 360000 |\n| `minRetryDelay` | Minimum wait time (in ms) between each retries of an event. | 1000 |\n| `backoffFactor` | Exponential base. | 2   |\n| `backoffJitter` | Jitter to be applied to the delay. | 0   |\n| `maxAttempts` | Maximum number of attempts to send the event to the RudderStack backend (data plane). | 10  |\n| `maxItems` | Maximum number of events buffered in the persistent storage for processing. | 100 |\n| `batch` | Options for batched requests. | [`BatchOpts`](#batchopts) |\n\n##### **Batch request options**\n\n| Parameter | Description | Default value |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `enabled` | Determines whether to enable batching. | `false` |\n| `maxItems` | Maximum number of events in a batch. | 100 |\n| `maxSize` | Maximum batch payload size (in bytes). | 512 KB (Also the maximum configurable value) |\n| `flushInterval` | Minimum interval (in ms) between two batch requests. | 60000 |\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Note that:\n> \n> *   `queueOptions.batch` is an optional object, meaning batching is disabled by default.\n> *   The SDK makes a batch request when either of the following criteria is met:\n>     *   `maxItems` in a batch is reached.\n>     *   `maxSize` of the batch is reached.\n>     *   Time period of `flushInterval` ms has elapsed since the last batch request.\n\n#### **Session options**\n\nThe `SessionOpts` object contains the options related to the SDK’s automatic session tracking behavior. Refer to the [Session Tracking](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/session-tracking/#automatic-session-tracking) guide for more information. Its structure is defined as follows:\n\n| **Parameter** | **Description** | **Default value** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `autoTrack` | Determines if the SDK should automatically track the user sessions. | `true` |\n| `timeout` | The maximum inactivity period (in ms) before the session expires. | 1800000 (30 minutes) |\n\n#### **Consent management options**\n\nOnce a user provides the consent, you can load the JavaScript SDK and enable the [OneTrust integration](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/data-governance/consent-management/onetrust/javascript/) via the `consentManagement` object:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.load(WRITE_KEY, DATA_PLANE_URL, {\n  consentManagement: {\n    enabled: true,\n    provider: \"oneTrust\"\n  },\n  // other options\n});\n```\n\n#### **Anonymous ID options**\n\nYou can use the `anonymousIdOptions` object to automatically capture the anonymous ID from a source and set it as RudderStack’s `anonymousId`.\n\nFor example, if you are migrating from a particular source and want to retain its anonymous ID, you can enable the `anonymousIdOptions` to set the source’s anonymous ID as the `anonymousId` in RudderStack.\n\nThe structure of `anonymousIdOptions` is defined as follows:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.load(WRITE_KEY, DATA_PLANE_URL, {\n  anonymousIdOptions: {\n    autoCapture: {\n      enabled: true,\n      source: \"segment\"\n    }\n  }\n});\n```\n\nThe following table describes the above (required) parameters in detail:\n\n| Parameter | Type | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `enabled` | Boolean | Determines if the anonymous ID should be auto-captured. |\n| `source` | String | Determines the external source of anonymous ID. The only allowed value is `segment`. |\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> If the RudderStack `anonymousId` is already set in your browser, `anonymousIdOptions` will not take effect.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> You can call the **reset** API to clear the persisted anonymous ID and force the SDK to generate a new ID when the next tracking API is called (irrespective of whether `anonymousIdOptions` is enabled or disabled). However, if the `anonymousIdOptions` object is enabled and the SDK is loaded again (as a result of webpage reload, navigate to a different webpage, etc.), the `setAnonymousId` call will trigger automatically and the specified source’s anonymous ID will again be set as the RudderStack `anonymousId`.\n\n#### **Configure information present in context**\n\nYou can use the `uaChTrackLevel` option to configure the information a user should get in the `context` object regarding the [client hints](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Client_hints). The JavaScript SDK fetches this information using the [user-agent client hints API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/User-Agent_Client_Hints_API). It can take the below values:\n\n*   `none`: Specifies that `uaChTrackLevel` field is absent in the `context` object.\n*   `default`: Specifies that `uaChTrackLevel` field is present in the `context` object and contains an object similar to the one below:\n\n```\n{\n  \"brands\": [{\n    \"brand\": \"Chromium\",\n    \"version\": \"110\"\n  }, {\n    \"brand\": \"Not A(Brand\",\n    \"version\": \"24\"\n  }, {\n    \"brand\": \"Google Chrome\",\n    \"version\": \"110\"\n  }],\n  \"mobile\": false,\n  \"platform\": \"macOS\"\n}\n```\n\n*   `full`: Specifies that `uaChTrackLevel` field is present in the `context` object and contains an object similar to the one below:\n\n```\n{\n  \"architecture\": \"arm\",\n  \"bitness\": \"64\",\n  \"brands\": [{\n    \"brand\": \"Chromium\",\n    \"version\": \"110\"\n  }, {\n    \"brand\": \"Not A(Brand\",\n    \"version\": \"24\"\n  }, {\n    \"brand\": \"Google Chrome\",\n    \"version\": \"110\"\n  }],\n  \"fullVersionList\": [{\n    \"brand\": \"Chromium\",\n    \"version\": \"110.0.5481.77\"\n  }, {\n    \"brand\": \"Not A(Brand\",\n    \"version\": \"24.0.0.0\"\n  }, {\n    \"brand\": \"Google Chrome\",\n    \"version\": \"110.0.5481.77\"\n  }],\n  \"mobile\": false,\n  \"model\": \"\",\n  \"platform\": \"macOS\",\n  \"platformVersion\": \"13.1.0\",\n  \"uaFullVersion\": \"110.0.5481.77\",\n  \"wow64\": false\n}\n```\n\n#### **The `onLoaded` callback function**\n\nThe `onLoaded` callback function takes the `rudderanalytics` instance as an argument and executes after the JavaScript SDK loads and before the native device-mode destination SDKs are loaded.\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.load(WRITE_KEY, DATA_PLANE_URL, {\n  onLoaded: function(rudderanalytics) {\n    console.log(\"All set!\");\n  }\n});\n```\n\n#### **Use globally-defined integration options at event level**\n\nYou can use this option to use the `integrations` object of the `load` method at the event level when it is not present at the event level.\n\nFor example, if the `integrations` object is defined in the `load` method and the `useGlobalIntegrationsConfigInEvents` option is set to `true`:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.load(WRITE_KEY, DATA_PLANE_URL, {\n  integrations: {\n    All: true,\n    \"Google Analytics\": false,\n    ...\n  },\n  useGlobalIntegrationsConfigInEvents: true,\n  // other load options\n});\n```\n\n**Case 1**: `integrations` option is present at the event level:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\n  \"Order Completed\", {\n    revenue: 30,\n    currency: \"USD\",\n    user_actual_id: 12345\n  }, {\n    integrations: {\n      All: true,\n      Amplitude: false\n    },\n  },\n  () => {\n    console.log(\"track call\");\n  }\n);\n```\n\nIn this case, the JavaScript SDK uses the `integrations` option from the `track` event.\n\n**Case 2**: `integrations` option is not present at the event level:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\n  \"Order Completed\", {\n    revenue: 30,\n    currency: \"USD\",\n    user_actual_id: 12345\n  }, {},\n  () => {\n    console.log(\"track call\");\n  }\n);\n```\n\nIn this case, the SDK uses the `integrations` option from the `load` method.\n\n#### **Destination queue options**\n\nThe `destinationsQueueOptions` object controls the behavior of the in-memory queue that buffers events before sending them to the device mode destinations. Its structure is defined as follows:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.load(WRITE_KEY, DATA_PLANE_URL, {\n  destinationsQueueOptions: {\n    maxItems: 100\n  }\n});\n```\n\n| Parameter | Type | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `maxItems` | Integer | Maximum number of events the device mode destinations (in-memory) queue can store while the destinations are still loading.<br><br>**Default value**: 100 |\n\n#### **Set external anonymous ID cookie name**\n\nYou can use this option to specify the cookie name in cases where the user has set a cookie for the SDK to fetch the external anonymous ID and use it further as the RudderStack’s `anonymousId`.\n\nIf you provide a cookie name that does not exist, the SDK either uses the existing `anonymousId` or generates a new one.\n\nNote that the external `anonymousId` is fetched only once while loading the SDK and any changes to the `anonymousId` cookie mid-session is not reflected in the events. To modify the `anonymousId` stored by RudderStack in such cases, use the [`setAnonymousId`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/supported-api/#overriding-anonymous-id) method.\n\n## Plugins\n\nPlugins are JavaScript SDK features that you can optionally load on demand.\n\n| Name | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `BeaconQueue` | Uses the browser’s Beacon utility to send a batch of events to the data plane instead of a single event per request.<br><br>See [Sending events using Beacon](#send-events-using-beacon) for more information. |\n| `DeviceModeDestinations` | Loads the device mode destinations supported by RudderStack. |\n| `ErrorReporting` | Reports SDK errors to RudderStack. |\n| `ExternalAnonymousId` | Lets you migrate the external anonymous user IDs to RudderStack’s `anonymousId`.<br><br>See [`anonymousIdOptions`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/load-js-sdk/#anonymousidoptions) for more information. |\n| `GoogleLinker` | Provides `anonymousId` from Google AMP Linker URL query parameters. |\n| `NativeDestinationQueue` | Stores incoming events in a queue and sends them to the device mode destinations. |\n| `StorageEncryptionLegacy` | Existing (SDK version v1.1 or below) approach to encrypt/decrypt data before storing the data. |\n| `StorageEncryption` | Lightweight alternative to encrypt/decrypt data before storing the data. |\n| `StorageMigrator` | Assists the SDK in migrating the legacy encrypted persisted data. |\n| `XhrQueue` | Stores incoming events in a local storage retry queue and sends them to the data plane via XMLHttpRequest. |\n| `OneTrustConsentManager` | Integrates the OneTrust consent manager.<br><br>See [OneTrust consent management for web](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/data-governance/consent-management/onetrust/javascript/) for more information. |\n| `KetchConsentManager` | Integrates the Ketch consent manager.<br><br>See [Ketch consent management for web](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/data-governance/consent-management/ketch/) for more information. |\n| `Bugsnag` | Integrates Bugsnag as an error reporting provider. |\n\nIf you wish to use only a subset of the SDK features, you can explicitly specify the plugins in the `plugins` option while loading the SDK.\n\nFor example, if you **do not want** the external anonymous ID, Google Linker and error reporting features, you can provide an array of plugin names excluding those plugins. A sample snippet highlighting how to set the `plugins` load option in this scenario:\n\n```\nplugins: [\"BeaconQueue\", \n          \"DeviceModeDestinations\", \n          \"NativeDestinationQueue\",\n          \"StorageEncryptionLegacy\",\n          \"StorageEncryption\",\n          \"StorageMigrator\",\n          \"XhrQueue\",\n          \"OneTrustConsentManager\",\n          \"KetchConsentManager\"\n         ]\n```\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> If you set the `plugins` option and exclude certain plugins from the list (for example, `OneTrustConsentManager`), setting the associated options while loading the SDK (for example, `consentManagement.provider` to `oneTrust`) will have no effect.\n\nIf you **do not specify** the `plugins` option while loading the JavaScript SDK, then RudderStack considers **all** plugins mentioned in the above table by default.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> **Once the list of plugins is determined, the SDK automatically loads a subset of them based on your load options, browser capabilities, and source configuration**.\n> \n> For example, if you set `consentManagement.provider` to `ketch`, then the SDK will not load `OneTrustConsentManager` plugin by default.\n\n#### **Lazyloading plugins**\n\nFor older browsers and users intentionally using the legacy Javascript SDK, RudderStack bundles the plugins with the core SDK. However, for modern browsers, the SDK lazy loads the plugins as multiple small chunks. These chunks are very small in size and loaded with the website parallelly.\n\nThe SDK’s bundling tool uses a package that supports Module Federation to bundle each feature into separate code chunks that can have interdependency among themselves. These chunks act as containers and can expose and consume code between them, creating a single, unified application. These chunks or plugins are then uploaded into CDN.\n\nDepending on the load options, browser capabilities, and source configuration, RudderStack fetches these plugins from the remote location at runtime when the SDK loads.\n\n## Storage\n\nYou can use the `storage` load option to configure different storage-specific features like encryption and migration.\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.load(WRITE_KEY, DATA_PLANE_URL, {\n  storage: {\n    encryption: {\n      version: \"v3\" / \"legacy\"\n    },\n    migrate: true / false,\n    cookie: {\n      maxage: 31536000 * 1000, // 1 year\n      path: \"/\",\n      domain: \"example.com\",\n      samesite: \"Lax\",\n      secure: true / false\n    }\n  }\n});\n```\n\n| Parameter | Type | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `encryption` | Object | Configures the encryption type for persisted user data. It consists of a `version` parameter that accepts two values - `v3` and `legacy`.<br><br>The SDK uses Base64 encryption if you set `version` to `v3` and AES encryption for `legacy`.<br><br>**Default value**: `v3` |\n| `migrate` | Boolean | Migrates persisted legacy encrypted data if set to `true`.<br><br>**Default value**: `true` |\n| `cookie` | Object | Contains the configurable options for the cookie.<br><br>See [Cookie settings](#cookie-settings) for more information. |\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> If you set `version` to `legacy`, then you must also load the `StorageEncryptionLegacy` plugin. For `v3`, you must load the `StorageEncryption` plugin.\n> \n> Similarly, if you do not set `migrate` to `false`, then you must also load the `StorageMigrator` plugin.\n\nNote that:\n\n*   If you access the SDK persisted data directly from the cookie or local storage, you must update the custom decryption logic.\n*   All sites under the same top-level domain must use the same encryption version. For example, if `xyz.test.com` uses the latest JavaScript SDK and `abc.test.com` uses a legacy SDK version (v1.1 or below), then you should set the `storage` load option as follows:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.load(WRITE_KEY, DATA_PLANE_URL, {\n  storage: {\n    encryption: {\n      version: \"legacy\"\n    }\n  },\n  // other load options\n});\n```\n\n*   Migrating all your subdomain sites to use SDK v3 is recommended.\n\n### Cookie settings\n\nThe `cookie` object contains the configurable options for your cookie. All parameters in this object are **optional**.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> The configuration provided in these cookie options overrides any other cookie settings.\n\n| Parameter | Type | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `maxage` | Number | Maximum duration (in ms) that the cookie lives.<br><br>**Default value**: 1 year |\n| `path` | String | Path of the page where the cookie is accessible.<br><br>**Default value**: `/` |\n| `domain` | String | Sets the cookie domain.<br><br>**Default value**: The SDK captures and uses the current domain as the default value. |\n| `samesite` | String | Sets the `SameSite` attribute of the cookie.<br><br>**Default value**: `Lax` |\n| `secure` | Boolean | Determines if the SDK should send the cookie to the storage backend via HTTPS.<br><br>**Default value**: `false` |\n\n## Configure persistent data storage\n\nWhile loading the JavaScript SDK, you can specify the information to store (`userId`, `anonymousId`, session information, etc.) and whether to store it in your browser’s cookies, local storage, in-memory storage, or not store it at all (fully anonymous tracking).\n\nSee [Configure Persistent Data Storage](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/data-storage-cookies/persistent-data-storage/) guide for more information.\n\n## Consent management\n\nYou can integrate the JavaScript SDK with leading consent management solutions like [OneTrust](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/data-governance/consent-management/onetrust/) and [Ketch](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/data-governance/consent-management/ketch/) or set up a custom consent management solution.\n\nIn addition, you can also configure the pre-consent behavior - either tracking users as fully anonymous, tracking only their sessions, or tracking with `anonymousId` as their identifier. This minimizes any data loss related to attribution, acquisition, and the overall user journey.\n\nUse the `consentManagement` load option to set your consent management preferences while loading the SDK, as shown:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.load(WRITE_KEY, DATA_PLANE_URL, {\n  consentManagement: {\n    enabled: true,\n    provider: 'oneTrust' // `ketch`\n  }\n});\n```\n\n## Load SDK for self-hosted control plane\n\nIf you are self-hosting the control plane using the [Control Plane Lite](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/get-started/rudderstack-open-source/control-plane-lite/#using-sdk-sources-set-up-in-self-hosted-control-plane) utility, the `load` call should be made as below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.load(WRITE_KEY, DATA_PLANE_URL, {\n  configUrl: CONTROL_PLANE_URL,\n});\n```\n\n## Allowlist RudderStack domain\n\nIf you are using RudderStack’s CDN for the SDK content, add the following (minimum) content security policy (CSP) header configuration to load the JavaScript SDK without any errors:\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> A content security policy (CSP) adds an extra layer of protection from any type of cross-site scripting, clickjacking, and data injection attacks.\n\n```\n<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Security-Policy\" content=\"script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https: //cdn.rudderlabs.com/ https://cdn.rudderstack.com/;\">\n```\n\nIf you don’t want to allow unsafe inline and use the CDN package with its loading snippet, use `nonce` attribute to the script tag for the loading snippet:\n\n```\n<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Security-Policy\" content=\"script-src 'self' 'nonce-rAnd0m' https: //cdn.rudderlabs.com/ https://cdn.rudderstack.com/;\">\n```\n\nIf you use the NPM package, no inline loading snippet is required:\n\n```\n<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Security-Policy\" content=\"script-src 'self' https: //cdn.rudderlabs.com/ https://cdn.rudderstack.com/;\">\n```\n\n### Device mode destinations\n\nWhile using the JavaScript SDK with destinations that support [device mode](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#device-mode), you might need to allowlist the domain from where the destination SDK loads in your content security policy (CSP).\n\nSee the specific [destination’s documentation](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/) to obtain the domain to be allowlisted. For example, [Braze](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/braze/#connection-mode).\n\n## Tracking user sessions\n\nBy default, the JavaScript SDK automatically tracks the user sessions. This means that RudderStack automatically determines the start and end of a user session depending on the inactivity time configured in the SDK (default time is 30 minutes).\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.load(WRITE_KEY, DATA_PLANE_URL, {\n  sessions: {\n    autoTrack: true,\n    timeout: 10 * 60 * 1000,  // 10 min in milliseconds\n  },\n  ...<otherLoadOptions>\n});\n```\n\nTo disable automatic session tracking, you can set the load option `autoTrack` to `false`.\n\nFor more information on the user sessions and how to track them using the JavaScript SDK, refer to the [Session Tracking](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/session-tracking/) guide.\n\n## Send events using Beacon\n\nThe JavaScript SDK lets you send the event payloads using the **XHR** (XMLHttpRequest) API (default) or [Beacon](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/sendBeacon) browser utility.\n\nThere are two advantages of using the [Beacon](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/sendBeacon) utility to send your event payload:\n\n*   The events delivery request is executed even when the page unloads, leading to no loss of data.\n*   The Beacon requests are optimized so that the browser waits until the CPU load is lower or until the network is free before making the actual requests, leading to better website performance.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> The Beacon queue maintained by the browsers limits the total size of the elements present in the queue at any point and **peaks at 64 KB**.\n\nSee [Event delivery and retry mechanism](#event-delivery-and-retry-mechanism) to help you decide whether to use Beacon to send your events.\n\n#### **Workflow**\n\nThe **Beacon** browser utility asynchronously sends a small amount of data over HTTP to the RudderStack server. To send the SDK events using this utility, set the `useBeacon` field in the [`load()`](#loading-options) call options to `true`.\n\nThe SDK internally uses a queue (`BeaconQueueOpts`) to buffer the events and send it through the Beacon utility in batches. The queue options can be configured as shown below:\n\n```\n{\n  maxItems: 10, \n  flushQueueInterval: 600000 // In ms\n}\n```\n\nThe following table describes the above `integer` type parameters in detail:\n\n| Parameter | Description | Default Value |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `maxItems` | The SDK flushes the events queue when the event count meets this limit. | 10  |\n| `flushQueueInterval` | The SDK flushes the events queue periodically at this interval (ms). | 600000 |\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> The JavaScript SDK flushes the Beacon events queue if the total size of the payload exceeds 64 KB before even reaching the `maxItems` or `flushQueueInterval` criteria.\n\n### Event delivery and retry mechanism\n\nThis section highlights some important points which will help you choose whether to use Beacon for sending your event payloads:\n\n*   The requests sent from the SDK using the Beacon utility only push the events to the browser’s Beacon queue. Further, it depends on the browser’s engine to send these events from the queue. Hence, RudderStack **cannot guarantee** if any events get discarded due to any 5xx or other network-related errors (request timed out, end resource unavailable, etc.).\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> If event delivery and retry is an important requirement for your website, using the XHR API of the JavaScript SDK is highly recommended. RudderStack retries event delivery based on the status codes and other errors.\n\n*   The Beacon queue maintained by the browsers limits the total size of the elements present in the queue at any point and **peaks at 64 KB**. Therefore, you cannot send high-frequency hits from the main thread in one go, as the Beacon queue cannot take up cycles to dequeue itself.\n\nQuestions?

    "markdown": "# Models | RudderStack Docs\n\nRun custom SQL queries on your warehouse and send resulting data to the specified destinations.\n\n* * *\n\n*     4 minute read  \n    \n\nRudderStack’s **Models** feature lets you create models by defining custom SQL queries. You can then run these queries on your warehouse and send the resulting data to specific destinations. You can create as many models and reuse them with their corresponding [Reverse ETL sources](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/reverse-etl/).\n\nWith this feature, you can:\n\n*   Build models with complex SQL queries using an intuitive UI.\n*   Manage views of all models synced to different destinations in one place.\n*   Reuse existing models in multiple connections.\n\n## Create new model\n\n1.  Log in to the [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/).\n2.  From the left navigation bar, go to **Activate** > **Models** and click **New model**.\n3.  Configure the settings explained in the following sections:\n\n### Select source\n\nSelect the warehouse source for which you want to create a model. RudderStack supports the Models feature for the following sources:\n\n*   [Amazon Redshift](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/reverse-etl/amazon-redshift/)\n*   [Google BigQuery](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/reverse-etl/google-bigquery/)\n*   [PostgreSQL](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/reverse-etl/postgresql/)\n*   [Snowflake](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/reverse-etl/snowflake/)\n*   [Databricks](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/reverse-etl/databricks/)\n*   [Trino](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/reverse-etl/trino/)\n\n### Specify warehouse credentials\n\nSpecify the warehouse credentials to authenticate RudderStack. See the **Configure warehouse credentials** section of the [source-specific documentation](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/reverse-etl/#supported-reverse-etl-sources) (for example, [Redshift](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/reverse-etl/amazon-redshift/#configuring-the-connection-credentials)) for more details.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Once you select or add your warehouse credentials and click **Next**, RudderStack will validate them before you can proceed with the setup. See [FAQ](#faq) for more information on these validations.\n\n### Specify model name\n\n*   Assign a name to uniquely identify the source in the RudderStack dashboard.\n*   Select the source type to **Model** and click **Continue**.\n\n### Configure model\n\n1.  Enter an optional model description.\n2.  Specify the custom SQL query in **Query** section.\n3.  Click **Run Query** to fetch the data preview.\n4.  Select the **Primary key** to use a column that uniquely identifies your warehouse records.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> You can set a primary key only after you run the SQL query successfully using the **Run Query** option.\n\n[![Model configuration](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/data-pipelines/model-source-configuration.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/data-pipelines/model-source-configuration.webp)\n\nNote the following:\n\n*   The **Preview** section displays the preview of the 50 resultant rows in a paginated format.\n*   You can add single-line/multiline comments above the query. However, RudderStack supports only multiline comments at the end of the query. Support for single-line comments is coming soon.\n*   You don’t need to add a semi-colon at the end of a query. RudderStack handles this automatically before running the query on the warehouse data.\n\n### Review and complete setup\n\nTo make any changes to the warehouse credentials or audience configuration, click the edit icon present next to those sections.\n\n[![Edit audience configuration](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/data-pipelines/edit-model-configuration.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/data-pipelines/edit-model-configuration.webp)\n\nOnce you have reviewed your configuration, click **Create source** to complete the setup.\n\n### Connect model to destination\n\nYou can connect this source to an existing or new [destination](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/overview/) to start using it. To connect to a destination later, click **Done** on the top right.\n\n[![Next steps](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/retl-sources/created-source.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/retl-sources/created-source.webp)\n\nYou will then be redirected to the **Overview** page of the source where you get the option of connecting it to an existing or new destination.\n\n[![Add destination](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/retl-sources/add-destination.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/retl-sources/add-destination.webp)\n\nSee [Set up Reverse ETL Connection](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/reverse-etl/retl-connection-setup/) section for more information.\n\n## Update model\n\n1.  Go to the **Configuration** tab of the model source.\n2.  To change the model description, click the edit icon in the **Configuration settings**.\n3.  Click **Edit query** to change or update the model settings and primary key.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> Note that:\n> \n> *   You can set a primary key only after you run the updated SQL query successfully using the **Run Query** option.\n> *   If you update the model’s query, you also need to check and update the relevant destination mappings in the **Schema** tab of the connection page.\n> *   After updating the configuration, the next sync will be a full sync. To validate if the query is running fine, you can manually trigger a full sync.\n\nGo to the **Settings** tab to:\n\n*   Get your source ID.\n*   Change your warehouse credentials.\n*   [Set up custom alerts](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/data-governance/alerts/) for your Reverse ETL source.\n*   Delete the source permanently.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> You cannot delete a source that is connected to any destination.\n\n[![Edit source settings](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/retl-sources/source-settings.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/retl-sources/source-settings.webp)\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### **What do the three validations under Verifying Credentials imply?**\n\nOnce you proceed after entering the connection credentials, you will see the following validations under the **Verifying Credentials** option:\n\n[![Validating credentials](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/retl-sources/retl-credentials-validate.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/retl-sources/retl-credentials-validate.webp)\n\nThese options are explained below:\n\n*   **Verifying Connection**: Indicates that RudderStack is trying to connect to the warehouse with the information specified in the connection credentials.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> If this option gives an error, it means that one or more fields specified in the connection credentials are incorrect. Verify your credentials in this case.\n\n*   **Able to List Schema**: Checks if RudderStack is able to fetch all schema details using the provided credentials.\n    \n*   **Able to Access RudderStack Schema**: Checks if RudderStack has the required access to the `_RUDDERSTACK` / `_rudderstack` schema (depending on your warehouse). To create the schema, run all commands listed in the **Permissions** section of the respective Reverse ETL source documentation:\n    \n    *   [BigQuery](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/reverse-etl/google-bigquery/#granting-permissions)\n    *   [Databricks](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/reverse-etl/databricks/#granting-permissions)\n    *   [PostgreSQL](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/reverse-etl/postgresql/#granting-permissions)\n    *   [Redshift](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/reverse-etl/amazon-redshift/#granting-permissions)\n    *   [Snowflake](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/reverse-etl/snowflake/#granting-permissions)\n    *   [Trino](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/reverse-etl/trino/#granting-permissions)\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> If this option gives an error, verify if you have successfully created the `_RUDDERSTACK` / `_rudderstack` schema and given RudderStack the required permissions to access it.\n\nQuestions?

Finally, click **Add Webhook**.\n\n## Event transformation\n\nRudderStack ingests all events mentioned in the [PagerDuty documentation](https://developer.pagerduty.com/docs/ZG9jOjQ1MTg4ODQ0-overview#event-types) after converting them into the RudderStack event format. It also maps the following properties from the PagerDuty event payload to the RudderStack properties:\n\n| PagerDuty property | RudderStack property |\n| --- | --- |\n| `event_type` | `event` |\n| `id` | `messageId` |\n| `occurred_at` | `OriginalTimeStamp` |\n| `resource_type` | `properties.resourceType` |\n| `data` | `properties.data` |\n| `client` | `properties.client` |\n| `agent` | `context.traits` |\n| `userId` | `agent.id` |\n\n## How RudderStack creates the event payload\n\nThis section details how RudderStack receives the data from PagerDuty source and creates the resulting

Use the `entries` object in the `storage` load option and define the storage type for your user data.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> Note that:\n> \n> *   The storage options set in the `entries` object override the global storage `type`.\n> *   The SDK uses the global storage `type` for storing user data that is not explicitly defined in the `entries` object.\n> *   The SDK migrates the existing user data to the newly selected storage option automatically.\n> *   The SDK removes any stored user data if you set `type` to `none`.\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.load(WRITE_KEY, DATA_PLANE_URL, {\n  storage: {\n    entries: {\n      userId: {\n        type: \"cookieStorage\"\n      },\n      userTraits: {\n        type: \"localStorage\"\n      },\n      sessionInfo: {\n        type: \"none\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  // other load options\n});\n```\n\nIn the above snippet, the global storage `type` is not defined. Hence, the SDK uses `cookieStorage` as the default storage option. Based on the `entries` object configured above, the SDK stores the user information as follows:\n\n| User information | Storage option |\n| --- | --- |\n| `userId`, `anonymousId`, `groupId`, `groupTraits`, `initialReferrer`, `initialReferringDomain` | `cookieStorage` |\n| `userTraits` | `localStorage` |\n| `sessionInfo` | `none` |\n\n## Use cases\n\nSuppose you define the following storage configurations for `userId` while loading the JavaScript SDK:\n\n**Case 1**\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.load(WRITE_KEY, DATA_PLANE_URL, {\n  storage: {\n    entries: {\n      userId: {\n        type: \"cookieStorage\"\n      },\n    }\n  }\n  // other load options\n});\n```\n\nWhen you trigger an `identify` call with `user123` as the `userId`, the SDK persists `user123` in the cookie storage. If a `track` call is triggered next, the payload will contain `user123` as the `userId`.\n\n**Case 2**\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.load(WRITE_KEY, DATA_PLANE_URL, {\n  storage: {\n    entries: {\n      userId: {\n        type: \"none\"\n      },\n    }\n  }\n  // other load options\n});\n```\n\nWhen you trigger an `identify` call, the SDK will **not** store the `userId` and the next set of events will have `userId` as an empty string (`\"\"`).\n\n**Case 3**\n\nIf you set the global storage `type` to `none` and then define the `type` in the `entries` object, then the SDK will **not** treat it as truly anonymous tracking.\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.load(WRITE_KEY, DATA_PLANE_URL, {\n  storage: {\n    type: \"none\",\n    entries: {\n      userId: {\n        type: \"cookieStorage\"\n      },\n    }\n  }\n  // other load options\n});\n```\n\nIn this case, the SDK replicates the behavior described in **Case 1**.\n\nQuestions?

    "markdown": "# Events Filtering in JavaScript SDK\n\nFilter events sent to downstream destinations using the JavaScript SDK.\n\n* * *\n\n*     2 minute read  \n    \n\nThis guide covers the following event filtering use cases:\n\n*   Filtering destinations while [loading the JavaScript SDK](#filter-destinations-while-loading-sdk).\n*   Sending events to specific destinations at the [event level](#filter-destinations-at-event-level).\n*   [Filtering client-side events](#client-side-event-filtering) before sending them to the specified destinations in [web device mode](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#device-mode).\n\n## Filter destinations while loading SDK\n\nYou can send the event data only to the selective destinations by passing an [integrations](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/load-js-sdk/#integrationopts) object in the [`load` API](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/load-js-sdk/#loading-options) options. RudderStack then loads and sends events only to the specified (and enabled) destinations.\n\nA sample snippet to send event data only to the **Google Analytics** and **Intercom** destinations:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.load(WRITE_KEY, DATA_PLANE_URL, {\n    integrations: {\n        All: false,\n        \"Google Analytics\": true,\n        \"Intercom\": true\n    }\n});\n```\n\n## Filter destinations at event level\n\nIn this scenario, the SDK sends events only to the specified (and enabled) destinations at the individual API level.\n\nA sample `track` event instrumentation to send event data only to the **Google Analytics** destination:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\n    \"Order Completed\", {\n        revenue: 30,\n        currency: \"USD\",\n        user_actual_id: 12345\n    }, {\n        integrations: {\n            All: false,\n            \"Google Analytics\": true\n        }\n    }\n);\n```\n\nThe [destination](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/) name inside the `integrations` object should exactly be the same as displayed in the [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/directory).\n\n## Client-side event filtering\n\nWhen you send events to a destination via [web device mode](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#device-mode), you can use the [Client-side Events Filtering](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/event-filtering/) feature to configure the `track` events that should be discarded or allowed to flow through.\n\nQuestions?

RudderStack uses this key to send events from a source to the specified destination.](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/resources/glossary/#write-key) .\n    \n*   [Storage data encryption](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/load-js-sdk/#storage) is changed to Base64 by default.\n    \n    *   The existing persisted data is migrated to the latest version by default unless otherwise specified by the user.\n    *   New load API options are introduced to set the encryption version and migration choice:\n    \n    ```\n    storage: {\n      migrate: true,\n      encryption: {\n          version: 'v3',\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n    \n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> It is recommended to use the same storage encryption version, preferably v3, across all your sites that share the same top-level domain.\n> \n> If you have any special needs and have implemented different SDK major versions across your sites, you need to set the encryption version to `legacy`. This way the SDK v3 will continue to use the same encryption technique as the older SDK versions so that your subdomain sites using those legacy SDK versions are not impacted at all.\n> \n> ```\n> rudderanalytics.load(WRITE_KEY, DATA_PLANE_URL, {\n>   storage: {\n>     encryption: {\n>       version: \"legacy\"\n>     }\n>   },\n>   // other load options\n> });\n> ```\n> \n> See [Migration considerations](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/migration-guide/#migration-considerations) for more information.\n\n## Installation\n\n*   The [SDK loading snippet](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/installation/) has changed.\n*   The file name is changed from `rudder-analytics.min.js` to `rsa.min.js`.\n*   The NPM package is changed from [`rudder-sdk-js`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rudder-sdk-js) to [`@rudderstack/analytics-js`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rudderstack/analytics-js).\n*   All the `GET` type of methods (`getAnonymousId`, `getGroupTraits`, and so on) have been removed from the loading snippet.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> The above `GET` methods will not yield anything before the SDK is loaded. Hence, it does not make sense to buffer those calls and replay them later.\n\n#### **No `page` call in loading snippet**\n\nThe default `page` call embedded at the end of the [loading snippet](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/installation/#using-cdn) has been removed. So, you need to explicitly make a `page` call if required.\n\n#### **Source configuration URL**\n\nThe **default** source configuration host has changed from `rudderlabs.com` to `rudderstack.com`. If you were previously forwarding the source configuration host, you must proxy `https://api.rudderstack.com` instead of `https://api.rudderlabs.com`.\n\nSee [How to Use Custom Domains](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/user-guides/how-to-guides/custom-domains/#setup-for-fetching-source-configuration) for more information.\n\n## Consent management\n\nIn JavaScript SDK v3, the `load` API option used for configuring consent management has changed.\n\nPreviously, you could specify the consent management options for integrating OneTrust as below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.load(WRITE_KEY, DATA_PLANE_URL, {\n  cookieConsentManager: {\n    oneTrust: {\n      enabled: true\n    }\n  }\n});\n```\n\nThe above snippet notifies the SDK to retrieve consent data from the OneTrust SDK loaded on your web page.\n\nIn SDK v3, `cookieConsentManager` is replaced with `consentManagement`. Also, the object structure for configuring the consent management options is changed. The new options are shown:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.load(WRITE_KEY, DATA_PLANE_URL, {\n  consentManagement: {\n    enabled: true,\n    provider: 'oneTrust'\n  }\n});\n```\n\n## Client-side events filtering\n\nFor [client-side events filtering](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/event-filtering/):\n\n*   Empty and non-string event names are not allowlisted anymore.\n*   Event name comparison is case-sensitive.\n\n## Ad blocker detection\n\nThis may not exactly be a breaking change - the ad blocker detection logic is updated. The SDK does not use the Google AdSense script anymore.\n\n## Other changes\n\n*   Service worker is now a separate package and will be published [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rudderstack/analytics-js-service-worker).\n*   [Sync pixel callback](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/archive/javascript-sdk/1.1/supported-api/#callbacks-to-common-methods) feature is removed.\n\nQuestions?

    "markdown": "# What's New in JavaScript SDK v3\n\nUnderstand the newly introduced features in JavaScript SDK v3.\n\n* * *\n\n*     2 minute read  \n    \n\nThis guide details the new features introduced in JavaScript SDK v3.\n\n## Event dispatching for SDK initialized and ready phases\n\nThe SDK v3 supports dispatching two new events to document - `RSA_Initialised` and `RSA_Ready` - when it is in the initialized and ready phases respectively.\n\nThese events provide a reference to the analytics instance (`analyticsInstance`) whenever you want to use it to invoke any API method, for example, `getUserId`.\n\nYou can listen to the above events as follows:\n\n```\n<script>\n   document.addEventListener('RSA_Initialised', function(e) {\n     console.log('RSA_Initialised', e.detail.analyticsInstance);\n   })\n   \n   document.addEventListener('RSA_Ready', function(e) {\n     console.log('RSA_Ready', e.detail.analyticsInstance);\n   })\n   \n</script>\n```\n\nYou can use this feature as an alternative to the `ready` API method and the [`onLoaded` load option](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/load-js-sdk/#loading-options) for orchestration with JavaScript frameworks and libraries. It is useful in cases where relevant business logic is in functions that cannot be declared alongside the analytics integration or they need to be declared on a decoupled code base for some reason.\n\n## Batching in XHRQueue plugin\n\nThe JavaScript SDK v3 provides the [`XhrQueue`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/load-js-sdk/#plugins) plugin that leverages [`queueOptions`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/load-js-sdk/#queueopts) to control the behavior of the persistence queue that buffers events in local storage before sending them to the data plane.\n\nYou can also send a batch of events to the data plane using the `queueOptions.batch` object while loading the SDK:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.load(WRITE_KEY, DATA_PLANE_URL, {\n  queueOptions: {\n    minRetryDelay: 1000, // ms\n    batch: {\n      enabled: true,\n      maxItems: 100,\n      maxSize: 1024 * 512 // 512 KB\n      flushInterval: 60000 // ms\n    },\n    ...\n  },\n  ...\n});\n```\n\nThe following table details the `queueOptions.batch` object parameters:\n\n| Parameter | Data type | Description | Default value |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `enabled` | Boolean | Determines if the SDK should activate the batching functionality. | false |\n| `maxItems` | Integer | Maximum number of events in a batch. | 100 |\n| `maxSize` | Integer | Maximum batch payload size. | 512 KB (Also, the maximum configurable value) |\n| `flushInterval` | Integer | Minimum interval between two batch requests. | 60000 ms |\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Note that:\n> \n> *   `queueOptions.batch` is an optional object, meaning batching is disabled by default.\n> *   The SDK makes a batch request when either of the following criteria is met:\n>     *   `maxItems` in a batch is reached.\n>     *   `maxSize` of the batch is reached.\n>     *   Time period of `flushInterval` ms has elapsed since the last batch request.\n\n## Debugging\n\nThe SDK v3 exposes the following objects globally that can assist in debugging:\n\n| Name | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `window.rudderAnalyticsBuildType` | Denotes the build type to load based on browser capabilities (modern or legacy). |\n| `window.RudderStackGlobals` | Contains some SDK application-level values, preloadBuffer (before it is consumed) and the SDK instance state per write key. You can use it to debug and see values in state at any point in time. |\n\nQuestions?

    "markdown": "# Pipedream source | RudderStack Docs\n\nIngest your event data from Pipedream into RudderStack.\n\n* * *\n\n*     2 minute read  \n    \n\n[Pipedream](https://pipedream.com/) lets you build and automate processes that connect APIs. It supports open source triggers and actions for hundreds of integrations.\n\nThis guide will help you set up Pipedream as a source in RudderStack.\n\n## Getting started\n\nFollow these steps to set up your Pipedream source in the RudderStack dashboard:\n\n1.  Go to your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/) and click **Add Source**. From the list of **Event Streams** sources, select **Pipedream**.\n2.  Assign a name to your source and click **Continue**.\n3.  Your Pipedream source is now configured. Note the **Webhook URL** in the **Settings** tab:\n\n[![Pipedream source webhook URL](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-sources/pipedream-webhook.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-sources/pipedream-webhook.webp)\n\n4.  Log in to your [Pipedream dashboard](https://pipedream.com/workflows/) and set up your workflow.\n5.  After [adding a trigger](https://pipedream.com/new?tutorial=1), click the **+** icon to add a step. Then, select the **HTTP/Webhook** option and choose **Send any HTTP Request**:\n\n[![Pipedream add a step](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-sources/pipedream-http-webhook.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-sources/pipedream-http-webhook.webp)\n\n6.  In the **HTTP Request Configuration** section, choose **POST** as the request type and enter the RudderStack webhook URL obtained in Step 3 above. Also, configure the other request configuration settings as required.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack only accepts the incoming HTTP requests of type **POST**.\n\n[![Pipedream custom HTTP request](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-sources/pipedream-custom-http-request.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-sources/pipedream-custom-http-request.webp)\n\n7.  Click **Deploy** to finish setting up the workflow.\n\n## Event transformation\n\nRudderStack ingests the Pipedream events and checks for the `userId`/`anonymousId` field and the event type (`identify`, `track`, etc.). If both are present, it considers the event to be in a RudderStack payload format. Otherwise, it converts it into a RudderStack payload according to the below property-value mapping:\n\n| RudderStack property | Value |\n| --- | --- |\n| `message.event` | `pipedream_source_event` |\n| `message.type` | `track` |\n| `message.properties` | Pipedream input payload |\n\n## How RudderStack creates the event payload\n\nRudderStack supports all [standard events](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/) in the specified format. For the other events, it transforms the incoming data to a [`track`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/track/) payload.\n\nA sample incoming payload is as shown:\n\n```\n{\n    \"artist\": \"Artist One\",\n    \"genre\": \"Jazz\",\n    \"song\": \"Take Five\"\n  }\n```\n\nRudderStack transforms the above payload into the following `track` payload:\n\n```\n{\n  \"event\": \"pipedream_soure_event\",\n  \"anonymousId\": \"63767499ca6fb1b7c988d5bb\",\n  \"integration\": {\n    \"name\": \"PIPEDREAM\"\n  },\n  \"integrations\": {\n    \"PIPEDREAM\": false\n  },\n  \"type\": \"track\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"artist\": \"Artist One\",\n    \"genre\": \"Jazz\",\n    \"song\": \"Take Five\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nQuestions?

It exposes the same interface and features as the [RudderStack Node SDK](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-node-sdk/).\n\n[![NPM Badge](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@rudderstack/analytics-js-service-worker)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rudderstack/analytics-js-service-worker)\n\n## Install the package\n\nTo install the package, run the following command:\n\n```\nnpm install @rudderstack/analytics-js-service-worker --save\n```\n\nThen, run the following code snippet and use the exported object throughout your project:\n\n```\nimport { Analytics } from '@rudderstack/analytics-js-service-worker';\n\nconst rudderClient = new Analytics('<WRITE_KEY>', '<DATA_PLANE_URL>/v1/batch');\n```\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> This NPM module is meant to be used only for service worker usage. To integrate RudderStack with your Node.js apps, use the [Node SDK](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-node-sdk/) instead.\n\n## Usage in Chrome extensions\n\nYou can use the JavaScript SDK in Chrome extensions with the manifest v3 - both as a [content script](#content-script) (via the JavaScript SDK package) or as [background script](#background-script) (via [service worker package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rudderstack/analytics-js-service-worker)).\n\nFor more information on usage in Chrome extensions, see the [JavaScript SDK GitHub repository](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-sdk-js/blob/main/examples/chrome-extension/USAGE.md).\n\n### Background script\n\nYou can use the RudderStack [service worker npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rudderstack/analytics-js-service-worker) as a background script. To do so, place it in your Chrome extension resources by following either of these approaches:\n\n*   Copy the file from the node modules and place it as a part of the resources.\n*   Use a JS bundler and bundle it as a part of your service worker script.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> You need to enable relevant permissions in the manifest file according to the required capabilities and allowed connections.\n> \n> Also, setting the background script `type` as a `module` is recommended, as it allows to import the script as ESM.\n\n```\n\"permissions\": [\"storage\", \"tabs\"],\n\"host_permissions\": [\n    \"https://*.dataplane.rudderstack.com/*\",\n    \"https://*.rudderlabs.com/*\",\n    \"*://*/*\"\n],\n\"externally_connectable\": {\n    \"matches\": [\n        \"https://*.dataplane.rudderstack.com/*\",\n        \"https://*.rudderlabs.com/*\"\n    ]\n},\n\"background\": {\n    \"service_worker\": \"service-worker.js\",\n    \"type\": \"module\"\n},\n```\n\nThen, follow the [Node SDK documentation](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-node-sdk/) for further usage.\n\nYou can also react to events available in the background scripts using the [Chrome API](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/).\n\nThe following example tracks any URL changes:\n\n```\n// If file is copied from node_modules/@rudderstack/analytics-js-service-worker/npm/esm/index.js in extension resources folder\n\nimport { Analytics } from \"./rudderAnalytics.js\";\n\n// If the package is imported directly as umd and then bundled in the background script\n\nimport { Analytics } from \"@rudderstack/analytics-js-service-worker/umd/index.js\";\n\n// If the package is imported directly as es-module and then bundled in the background script\n\nimport { Analytics } from \"@rudderstack/analytics-js-service-worker\";\n```\n\n```\nconst rudderClient = new Analytics(\"<WRITE_KEY>\",\"<DATA_PLANE_URL>/v1/batch\");\n\nchrome.tabs.onUpdated.addListener((tabId, tab) => {\n    if (tab.url) {\n        rudderClient.track({\n            userId: \"123456\",\n            event: \"Event Name\",\n            properties: {\n                data: { url: tab.url },\n            }\n        });\n    }\n});\n```\n\n### Content script\n\nTo use the RudderStack `Analytics` JavaScript SDK as a content script, place it in your Chrome extension resources by following either of these approaches:\n\n*   Download the file and place it as a part of the resources.\n*   Use a JS bundler and bundle it as part of your content script.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> You need to enable relevant permissions in the manifest file according to the required capabilities and allowed connections.\n\n```\n\"permissions\": [\"storage\", \"tabs\"],\n\"host_permissions\": [\n    \"https://*.dataplane.rudderstack.com/*\",\n    \"https://*.rudderlabs.com/*\",\n    \"*://*/*\"\n],\n\"externally_connectable\": {\n    \"matches\": [\n        \"https://*.dataplane.rudderstack.com/*\",\n        \"https://*.rudderlabs.com/*\"\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nThen, follow the [SDK documentation](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/) for further usage.\n\nYou can also react to events available in both the content and background scripts by leveraging the [Chrome API](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/).\n\nThe following sample scripts help you track any URL changes:\n\n```\n# prepend the JS SDK file here\nrudderanalytics.load(\"<WRITE_KEY>\", \"<DATA_PLANE_URL>\");\n\nchrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener((obj, sender, response) => {\n    const { type, value } = obj;\n\n    if (type === \"trackURL\") {\n        rudderanalytics.track(\"URL change\", { url: value });\n    }\n});\n```\n\n```\nchrome.tabs.onUpdated.addListener((tabId, tab) => {\n    if (tab.url) {\n        chrome.tabs.sendMessage(tabId, {\n            type: \"trackURL\",\n            value: {\n                url: tab.url\n            },\n        });\n    }\n});\n```\n\n## Usage in serverless runtimes\n\nYou can use the JavaScript SDK in serverless runtimes like Cloudflare workers or Vercel Edge functions.\n\n### Cloudflare worker\n\nTo use the JavaScript SDK service worker in Cloudflare workers, start with the [sample](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/get-started/guide/) and integrate the SDK in the `worker.js` file:\n\n```\nimport { Analytics } from '@rudderstack/analytics-js-service-worker';\n\nconst rudderClient = new Analytics(\n  \"<WRITE_KEY>\",\n  \"<DATA_PLANE_URL>/v1/batch\",\n  {\n    flushAt: 1\n  }\n);\n```\n\nThen, use the JavaScript SDK within the `fetch` methods with promisified flush:\n\n```\nconst flush = () => new Promise((resolve) => rudderClient.flush(resolve));\n\nrudderClient.track({\n  userId: '123456',\n  event: 'test cloudflare worker',\n  properties: {\n    data: {\n      url: 'test cloudflare worker',\n    },\n  },\n});\n\nawait flush();\n```\n\nFor more information, see this [sample implementation](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-sdk-js/tree/main/examples/serverless/cloudflare-worker).\n\n### Vercel Edge\n\nTo use the JavaScript SDK service worker in Vercel Edge functions, start with the [sample](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/edge-functions/quickstart) and integrate the SDK in the `app/api/edge-function-sample/route.ts` file:\n\n```\nimport { Analytics } from '@rudderstack/analytics-js-service-worker';\n\nconst rudderClient = new Analytics(\n  \"<WRITE_KEY>\",\n  \"<DATA_PLANE_URL>/v1/batch\",\n  {\n    flushAt: 1\n  }\n);\n```\n\nThen, use the JavaScript SDK within the `fetch` methods as usual:\n\n```\nrudderClient.track({\n  userId: '123456',\n  event: 'test vercel edge worker',\n  properties: {\n    data: {\n      url: 'test vercel edge worker',\n    },\n  }\n});\n```\n\nFor more information, see this [sample implementation](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-sdk-js/tree/main/examples/serverless/vercel-edge).\n\nQuestions?

Hence, you need to specify it while setting the prefix.\n\n*   **Schedule Settings**: RudderStack gives you three options to ingest the data from Google Sheets:\n    *   **Basic**: Runs the syncs at the specified time interval.\n    *   **CRON**: Runs the syncs based on the user-defined CRON expression.\n    *   **Manual**: You are required to run the syncs manually.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> For more information on the schedule types, refer to the [Common Settings](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/extract/common-settings/) guide.\n\n### Selecting the data to import\n\nYou can specify the Google Sheets data you want to sync by selecting the required sheet. You can also sync data from multiple sheets within the spreadsheet:\n\n[![Selecting the data to import](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/cloud-extract-sources/googlesheets-beta-sheet.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/cloud-extract-sources/googlesheets-beta-sheet.webp)\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack considers the first row of each sheet as the header. Empty sheets or sheets with an empty header will **not** be reflected in the **Select data to import** window.\n\nYou can also define the sync mode for each data resource you want to send to the destination. Click **Edit resources configuration** and specify the destination sync mode for the selected resource(s):\n\n[![Adding a destination](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/cloud-extract-sources/edit-resources-googlesheets.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/cloud-extract-sources/edit-resources-googlesheets.webp)\n\n*   **Overwrite**: RudderStack adds new rows in the warehouse destination and deletes the rows from previous syncs. This is the default sync mode.\n*   **Append and deduplicate**: RudderStack adds new rows and updates modified records in the warehouse destination in each sync.\n\nThe following destinations support the above sync modes:\n\n*   Snowflake\n*   Postgres\n*   MySQL\n*   BigQuery\n\nGoogle Sheets is now configured as a source. RudderStack will start ingesting data from Google Sheets as per your specified schedule and frequency.\n\nYou can further connect this source to your data warehouse by clicking the **Add Destination** button:\n\n[![Adding a destination](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/cloud-extract-sources/add-destination.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/cloud-extract-sources/add-destination.webp)\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Use the **Use Existing Destination** option if you have an already-configured data warehouse destination in RudderStack. To configure a data warehouse destination from scratch, select the **Create New Destination** button.\n\n## How RudderStack syncs data to the warehouse\n\nIf you select multiple sheets in the **Select data to import** window, RudderStack creates multiple tables (corresponding to each sheet) in the warehouse.\n\n[![Selecting the data to import](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/cloud-extract-sources/googlesheets-beta-sheet.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/cloud-extract-sources/googlesheets-beta-sheet.webp)\n\nIn the above example, RudderStack creates a table corresponding to each sheet (`List of Tracking Plans`, `Import Template`, and so on) in the warehouse.\n\nWhile syncing data to the warehouse, RudderStack creates columns only for the headers (first rows in the sheet) which also have data present in the second row (mandatory) and beyond (optional).\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> The mere presence of a header **does not** create a column in the destination.\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### How do I provide service account access to a Google sheet?\n\nIf you’re using a [service account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys#creating) to authenticate RudderStack to sync your Google Sheets data, you must also give the required access to the service account to access the required spreadsheet. Follow these steps to provide access to the required spreadsheet:\n\n1.  In your [Google Cloud console](https://console.cloud.google.com/), go to **APIs & Services** > **Credentials**.\n2.  Under **Service Accounts**, copy the email address listed under **Email**.\n\n[![Service account email](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/cloud-extract-sources/googlesheets-beta-service-account-email.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/cloud-extract-sources/googlesheets-beta-service-account-email.webp)\n\n3.  Go to the spreadsheet, click the **Share** button and paste the email copied above. Specify the permission you want to assign to this email.\n\n[![Service account permissions](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/cloud-extract-sources/googlesheets-beta-service-account-permissions.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/cloud-extract-sources/googlesheets-beta-service-account-permissions.webp)\n\n4.  Finally, click the **Send** button.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> If you get the **Share outside of organization** popup, click **Share anyway**.\n\nThe Google sheet will now be accessible in the dropdown. RudderStack can now access the sheet and sync the data from it.\n\nYes, it is.\n\nRudderStack associates a table prefix for every Cloud Extract source writing to a warehouse schema. This way, multiple Cloud Extract sources can write to the same schema with different table prefixes.\n\nRudderStack counts the number of records returned by the source APIs when queried during each sync. It considers each record as an event.\n\nRudderStack sets the table name for the resource you are syncing to the warehouse by adding `rudder_` to the **Table prefix** you set while configuring your Cloud Extract source in the dashboard.\n\n[![Cloud Extract table prefix](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/cloud-extract-sources/etl-table-prefix.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/cloud-extract-sources/etl-table-prefix.webp)\n\nFor example, if you set `test_` as the **Table prefix** in the dashboard, RudderStack sets the table name as `test_rudder_<resource_name>`, where `<resource_name>` is the name of the resource you are syncing (for example, `contacts`, `messages`, etc.).\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> Note that RudderStack does not add the character `_` to the prefix by default.

This is because many Intercom resources are not supported by the older API versions.\n\nIn such a scenario, it is highly recommended to updated your Intercom API.\n\n## FAQ\n\nYes, it is - RudderStack associates a table prefix for every Cloud Extract source writing to a warehouse schema. This way, multiple Cloud Extract sources can write to the same schema with different table prefixes.\n\n#### My data syncs are failing. What should I do?\n\nIf your data syncs are failing, verify if your Intercom version is **2.1** or above. For versions less than 2.1, data syncs to the warehouse destination will fail. This is because many Intercom resources are not supported by the older API versions. In this scenario, you will need to update your Intercom API.\n\nFor more information on updating your Intercom API version, refer to the [Intercom support page](https://developers.intercom.com/building-apps/docs/update-your-api-version).\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> If you are using Intercom 2.1 or above and are facing this issue, contact us via [email](mailto:%20support@rudderstack.com) or [Slack](https://rudderstack.com/join-rudderstack-slack-community).\n\nRudderStack counts the number of records returned by the source APIs when queried during each sync.

    "markdown": "# Common settings | RudderStack Docs\n\nTable prefix, schedule settings, and sync modes for configuring Extract sources.\n\n* * *\n\n*     4 minute read  \n    \n\nThis guide covers the common destination-specific settings to be configured while setting up your Cloud Extract sources. Common settings include: table prefix, schedule settings, and sync modes.\n\n[![Sendgrid destination settings](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/cloud-extract-sources/sendgrid-connection-settings-2.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/cloud-extract-sources/sendgrid-connection-settings-2.webp)\n\n## Table prefix\n\nRudderStack uses your specified table prefix to create a table named `prefix_table_name` in your data warehouse and load all imported source data into it.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> If you do not specify a prefix, RudderStack creates a table in your warehouse as `table_name`, where `table_name` refers to the resource you are importing.\n\nFor example, if you set the prefix to `rs_` and the resource you are importing is named `valid_emails`, then RudderStack creates the table `rs_valid_emails` in the warehouse.\n\n## Schedule settings\n\nRudderStack lets you set a schedule for importing data from your Cloud Extract sources while setting them up in your dashboard. It lets you specify the schedule type that defines how and when the syncs will run.\n\nRudderStack supports the following three schedule types:\n\n| Schedule type | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Basic | Run syncs at a given time interval and specified time. |\n| CRON | Run syncs based on a CRON expression defined by the user. |\n| Manual | Run syncs manually. |\n\n### Basic\n\nThis schedule type lets you run the data syncs at a set interval. You can specify the sync frequency as well as the time(in UTC) when you want the sync to start.\n\n[![Basic sync schedule](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warehouse-actions-sources/sync-schedule-basic.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warehouse-actions-sources/sync-schedule-basic.webp)\n\n*   **Frequency**: You can choose the data sync frequency from the following options:\n    \n    *   15 minutes\n    *   30 minutes\n    *   1 hour\n    *   3 hours\n    *   6 hours\n    *   12 hours\n    *   24 hours\n*   **Sync Starting At**: Specify the time at which the data sync should start.\n    \n\n### CRON\n\nThis schedule type lets you define a custom CRON expression and runs the data syncs based on this setting.\n\n[![CRON schedule](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warehouse-actions-sources/sync-schedule-cron.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warehouse-actions-sources/sync-schedule-cron.webp)\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> The sync frequency specified under **Run Settings** needs to be greater than or equal to 15 minutes. Otherwise, you will encounter an error as shown below:\n\n[![CRON schedule error](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warehouse-actions-sources/sync-schedule-cron-error.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warehouse-actions-sources/sync-schedule-cron-error.webp)\n\n### Manual\n\nThis schedule type lets you run your data syncs manually. RudderStack won’t sync the data until you explicitly trigger it.\n\nTo trigger a sync manually, go to the **Syncs** tab in your Cloud Extract source details page and click **Sync Now**:\n\n[![Manual sync schedule](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/cloud-extract-sources/sync-schedule-manual.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/cloud-extract-sources/sync-schedule-manual.webp)\n\n## Sync modes\n\nA sync mode determines how RudderStack reads the data from a source and writes to a warehouse destination. RudderStack supports the following sync modes:\n\n### Full Refresh\n\nIn this mode, RudderStack retrieves **all** the available information from the source, **regardless** of whether it has been synced previously.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> In this mode, RudderStack replaces all existing data with the new data.\n\n### Incremental\n\nIn this mode, RudderStack syncs or replicates only the new or modified data starting from the date specified in the **Start date** RudderStack dashboard setting. It does not replicate the data that has been already synced before.\n\nDuring the incremental syncs, RudderStack only updates the the existing rows that have been modified as opposed to adding a new version of the row with the updated data.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Any resource that supports the **Incremental** sync mode also supports **Full Refresh**, by default.\n> \n> *   If you want to do a Full Refresh sync only for particular Incremental resources, then [contact the RudderStack team](mailto:support@rudderstack.com). This is helpful in cases where your destination’s data gets corrupted or you want to sync your data all over again.\n> *   If you want to do a Full Refresh sync for all the resources associated with an Extract source, then change the **Start date** setting in your existing source configuration. Refer to the [FAQ](#how-do-i-force-a-full-refresh-sync-for-all-the-resources) section for more information.\n\n### Semi-Incremental\n\nThis sync mode is a combination of **Full Refresh** and **Incremental** sync modes. RudderStack reads all data from the source and filters it to sync only the new or modified data starting from the date specified in the **Start Date** RudderStack dashboard setting.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> The data synced in the **Semi-Incremental** mode is exactly the same as in the **Incremental mode**. The only difference is that in the **Semi-Incremental** mode, RudderStack internally filters the data to be synced instead of the source API.\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### Can I change my sync schedule type?\n\nYes, you can.\n\n1.  Go to the **Settings** tab in your Cloud Extract source details page and click **Edit sync schedule** option:\n\n[![Syncs schedule settings change](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/cloud-extract-sources/sync-schedule-settings-change.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/cloud-extract-sources/sync-schedule-settings-change.webp)\n\n2.  Then, select your new sync schedule type.\n\n#### What happens if I don’t set the Sync Starting At time?\n\nRudderStack considers strict time windows to schedule syncs if you do not explicitly set the time under **Sync Starting At**.\n\nSuppose you create a source at 12:30 hrs UTC, specify the **Frequency** as 3 hours, and do not specify any time under **Sync Starting At**. In this case, as the time falls in the 12:00-13:00 time window, RudderStack will run the next sync at 15:00 hrs UTC (12:00 + 03:00 = 15:00 hrs).\n\n#### How do I force a Full Refresh sync for all the resources?\n\nTo force a [Full Refresh](#full-refresh) sync for **all** the resources supported by the Extract source, change the **Start date** setting in your existing source configuration.\n\n[![Update Extract source configuration](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/cloud-extract-sources/extract-update-configuration.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/cloud-extract-sources/extract-update-configuration.webp)\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> Disconnecting and reconnecting an Extract source to a warehouse destination does not force a full sync.\n\nQuestions?

It offers an all-in-one email marketing and growth platform to monitor your users’ product behavior and use the insights to design personalized customer experiences.\n\nRudderStack supports ActiveCampaign as a destination to which you can seamlessly send your event data.\n\nFind the open source transformer code for this destination in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-transformer/tree/master/src/v0/destinations/active_campaign).\n\n## Setup\n\n1.  In your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), go to **Directory** > **Destinations** > **Cloud Destinations** and search for **ActiveCampaign**.\n2.  Connect your source and click **Continue**.\n\n### Connection settings\n\nConfigure the following settings to set up ActiveCampaign as a destination in RudderStack:\n\n*   **API URL:** Enter the ActiveCampaign API URL for your account.\n*   **API Key:** Enter the ActiveCampaign API key.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> To get the **API URL** and **API key**, log in to your ActiveCampaign account and go to the **Settings** page under the **Developer** tab.\n\n### Connection mode\n\nRudderStack supports the following [connection modes](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/) for sending events to ActiveCampaign:\n\n| Connection mode | Web | Mobile | Server |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Device mode | **Supported** | \\-  | \\-  |\n| Cloud mode | **Supported** | **Supported** | **Supported** |\n| Hybrid mode | **Supported** | \\-  | \\-  |\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> This destination supports hybrid mode for the [JavaScript](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/) source. For more information, see [Send events in hybrid mode](#send-events-in-hybrid-mode) section.\n\n### Send events in hybrid mode\n\nYou can use [hybrid mode](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#hybrid-mode) to send all events to ActiveCampaign from your [JavaScript](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/) source.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> In hybrid mode, RudderStack sends the `identify`, `track`, and `screen` events to ActiveCampaign via their REST API and `page` calls via the native ActiveCampaign SDK.\n\nTo send events via hybrid mode, use the hybrid mode option(highlighted below) while connecting your source to the ActiveCampaign destination.\n\n[![ActiveCampaign hybrid mode connection setting](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/activecampaign-hybrid-mode.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/activecampaign-hybrid-mode.webp)\n\n### Configuration settings\n\nAfter completing the initial setup, configure the following settings to correctly receive your data in ActiveCampaign:\n\n*   **Event Key:** This value is unique to your ActiveCampaign account. See [ActiveCampaign documentation](https://help.activecampaign.com/hc/en-us/articles/221870128-An-overview-of-Event-Tracking#how-to-turn-on-event-tracking-0-3) for more information on obtaining the event key.\n*   **ActID:** Enter your ActiveCampaign `actid`. Go to **Settings** > **Tracking** > **Event Tracking API** to get your **actid**.\n\n### Other settings\n\n*   **OneTrust Cookie Categories**: This setting lets you associate the [OneTrust](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/data-governance/consent-management/onetrust/javascript/) cookie consent groups to ActiveCampaign.\n\n## Identify\n\nYou can use the [`identify`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/identify/) call to create a new user in ActiveCampaign. If a user already exists, RudderStack updates the user with the latest values.\n\nA sample `identify` call is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify(\"userId\", {\n  email: \"john@example.com\",\n  firstName: \"John\",\n  lastName: \"Keener\",\n  phone: \"1234567890\"\n});\n```\n\nIn the above snippet, RudderStack captures relevant user information like their `userId` and the associated traits like `email`, `phone`, `firstName`, and `lastName`, before sending this information to ActiveCampaign.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> `email` is a mandatory trait for mapping a user to ActiveCampaign.\n\n### Set custom tags\n\nYou can associate a user with custom tags by passing the `tags` trait in your `identify` call:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify(\"userId\", {\n  email: \"john@example.com\",\n  firstName: \"John\",\n  lastName: \"Keener\",\n  phone: \"1234567890\",\n  tags: [\"Returning User\", \"Coupon Used\"]\n});\n```\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> `tags` should contain an array of tags you want to associate with the user. If any tag is already present in ActiveCampaign, RudderStack will skip creating that tag.\n\n### Send custom fields\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> To send custom fields to ActiveCampaign, you will need to first create the [custom fields](https://www.activecampaign.com/learn/guides/what-are-custom-fields) in ActiveCampaign for each custom value that you want to send.\n> \n> When you call `identify` with the keys matching those traits, RudderStack updates the custom fields for that contact.\n\nYou can update a contact by passing custom fields in your `identify` calls to ActiveCampaign.\n\nYou can use the `fieldInfo` trait to set values for the custom fields, as shown:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify(\"userId\", {\n  email: \"john@example.com\",\n  firstName: \"John\",\n  lastName: \"Keener\",\n  phone: \"1234567890\",\n  tags: [\"Returning User\", \"Coupon Used\"],\n  fieldInfo: {\n    Interest: \"Electronics\",\n    Country: \"USA\",\n    Hobbies: [\"Cricket\", \"Tennis\"]\n  }\n});\n```\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Note that:\n> \n> *   The `fieldInfo` trait contains the value of the custom field that you want to store for that contact. For using this feature, you need to create the custom fields from your ActiveCampaign dashboard before passing the values in the event.\n> *   To send multi-choice field values for the fields having a checkbox, or list values as an input, you need to send the values as an array. For example: `\"Hobbies\": [\"Cricket\",\"Tennis\"]`.\n> *   For the date field, the format should be YYYY-MM-DD. Also, the values for the datetime field should be in a ISO datetime format, that is, `yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss. SSSXXX`.\n\n### Subscribe contacts to lists\n\nYou can subscribe or unsubscribe a contact from any number of lists by passing a `lists` trait in your `identify` call. This trait should be an array with each element having an `id` and a `status`. The value of `status` must be either `subscribe` or `unsubscribe`.\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify(\"userId\", {\n  email: \"john@example.com\",\n  firstName: \"John\",\n  lastName: \"Keener\",\n  phone: \"1234567890\",\n  tags: [\"Returning User\", \"Coupon Used\"],\n  fieldInfo: {\n    Interest: \"Electronics\",\n    Country: \"USA\",\n    Hobbies: [\"Cricket\", \"Tennis\"]\n  },\n  lists: [\n    {\n      id: 2,\n      status: \"subscribe\"\n    },\n    {\n      id: 3,\n      status: \"unsubscribe\"\n    }\n  ]\n});\n```\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> For associating a contact to any list, you need to create the list in ActiveCampaign and use the `id` parameter for mapping that contact.\n\n## Track\n\nThe [`track`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/track/) call lets you record the user actions along with any properties associated with them.\n\nA sample `track` call looks like the following:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"Product Purchased\", {\n  name: \"Rubik's Cube\"\n});\n```\n\nIn the above snippet, RudderStack captures the information related to the `Product Purchased` event along with the product’s `name`.\n\nRudderStack also maps `eventData` present within the `track` event properties to ActiveCampaign’s `eventdata` field:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"Product Purchased\", {\n  name: \"Rubik's Cube\",\n  eventData: \"Learn while having fun\"\n});\n```\n\n### Event name considerations\n\nActiveCampaign sets certain restrictions in the way you can set your `track` event names:\n\n*   The event name must contain only alphanumeric characters. ActiveCampaign rejects any event containing special characters in the name.\n*   The event name should not exceed 32 characters. ActiveCampaign automatically truncates event names longer than 32 characters. For example, if you send a `track` event with the name `Product Viewed After Opening The Browser`, ActiveCampaign automatically truncates it to `Product Viewed After Opening The`:\n\n[![ActiveCampaign truncating event names](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/activecampaign-eventname-truncation.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/activecampaign-eventname-truncation.webp)\n\n## Page\n\nYou can use the `page` call to record user’s page views along with the associated properties and send this information to ActiveCampaign. You must call this method at least once per page load.\n\nWhen you call `page`, RudderStack will send that event to ActiveCampaign as a [site tracking event](https://help.activecampaign.com/hc/en-us/articles/221542267-An-overview-of-Site-Tracking) - this allowlists your domain for tracking purposes.\n\nA sample `page` call looks like the following:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.page(\"home\", {\n  path: \"path\",\n  url: \"url\",\n  title: \"title\",\n  search: \"search\",\n  referrer: \"referrer\"\n});\n```\n\nIn the above sample, RudderStack captures the information related to the viewed page and the `url` property is used to allowlist the website in ActiveCampaign.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> The `page` calls work only if **Site Tracking** is enabled in ActiveCampaign. You can enable this setting by going to the **Tracking** tab in your ActiveCampaign settings page.\n\n## Screen\n\nThe [`screen`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/screen/) lets you record whenever your user views their mobile screen with any additional relevant information about the screen.\n\nA sample `screen` call is shown:\n\n```\n[[RSClient sharedInstance] screen:@\"Sample Screen Viewed\" properties:@{@\"prop_key\" : @\"prop_value\"}];\n```\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> **The `screen` event name must contain only alphanumeric characters.**\n> \n> ActiveCampaign rejects events with any special characters in the name.\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### Can I use special characters in my `screen` and `track` event names?\n\nNo - your `screen` and `track` event names must contain only alphanumeric characters. ActiveCampaign prescribes that the `screen` and `track` event names must contain only alphabets and numbers and does not allow using any special characters.\n\n#### How does RudderStack send events to ActiveCampaign in hybrid mode?\n\nIn hybrid mode, RudderStack sends the user-generated events (`identify`, `track`, `screen`) events to ActiveCampaign via cloud mode and sends the `page` events via device mode (using the native ActiveCampaign web SDK).\n\nQuestions?

Hence, you need to specify it while setting the prefix.\n\n*   **Schedule Settings**: RudderStack gives you three options to ingest the data from Pipedrive:\n    *   **Basic**: Runs the syncs at the specified time interval.\n    *   **CRON**: Runs the syncs based on the user-defined CRON expression.\n    *   **Manual**: You are required to run the syncs manually.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> For more information on the schedule types, refer to the [Common Settings](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/extract/common-settings/) guide.\n\n### Selecting the data to import\n\nYou can choose the Pipedrive data you want to ingest by selecting the required resources:\n\n[![Selecting the data to import](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/cloud-extract-sources/pipedive-v2-resources.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/cloud-extract-sources/pipedive-v2-resources.webp)\n\nThe below table mentions the syncs supported by these resources from Pipedrive to your warehouse destination where `id` is a common primary key for all:\n\n| Resource | Sync type | Pipedrive API endpoint |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `users` | Incremental | `/v1/users` |\n| `stages` | Incremental | `/v1/stages` |\n| `products` | Incremental | `/v1/products` |\n| `product_fields` | Full Refresh | `/v1/productFields` |\n| `pipelines` | Incremental | `/v1/pipelines` |\n| `persons` | Incremental | `/v1/persons` |\n| `person_fields` | Full Refresh | `/v1/personFields` |\n| `organizations` | Incremental | `/v1/organizations` |\n| `organization_fields` | Full Refresh | `/v1/organizationFields` |\n| `notes` | Incremental | `/v1/notes` |\n| `leads` | Full Refresh | `/v1/leads` |\n| `deals` | Incremental | `/v1/deals` |\n| `deal_fields` | Full Refresh | `/v1/dealFields` |\n| `activity_fields` | Full Refresh | `/v1/activityFields` |\n| `activities` | Incremental | `/v1/activities` |\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> For more information on the **Full Refresh**, **Semi-Incremental**, and **Incremental** sync modes, refer to the [Common Settings](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/extract/common-settings/#sync-modes) guide.\n\nPipedrive is now configured as a source. RudderStack will start ingesting data from Pipedrive as per your specified schedule and frequency.\n\nYou can further connect this source to your data warehouse by clicking on **Add Destination**:\n\n[![Adding a destination](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/cloud-extract-sources/add-destination.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/cloud-extract-sources/add-destination.webp)\n\n> ![success](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/tick.svg)\n> \n> Use the **Use Existing Destination** option if you have an already-configured data warehouse destination in RudderStack. To configure a data warehouse destination from scratch, select the **Create New Destination** button.\n\n## FAQ\n\nYes, it is.\n\nRudderStack implements a feature wherein it associates a table prefix for every Cloud Extract source writing to a warehouse schema. This way, multiple Cloud Extract sources can write to the same schema with different table prefixes.\n\nRudderStack counts the number of records returned by the source APIs when queried during each sync. It considers each record as an event.\n\nRudderStack sets the table name for the resource you are syncing to the warehouse by adding `rudder_` to the **Table prefix** you set while configuring your Cloud Extract source in the dashboard.\n\n[![Cloud Extract table prefix](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/cloud-extract-sources/etl-table-prefix.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/cloud-extract-sources/etl-table-prefix.webp)\n\nFor example, if you set `test_` as the **Table prefix** in the dashboard, RudderStack sets the table name as `test_rudder_<resource_name>`, where `<resource_name>` is the name of the resource you are syncing (for example, `contacts`, `messages`, etc.).\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> Note that RudderStack does not add the character `_` to the prefix by default. Hence, you need to specify it while setting the prefix.\n\nQuestions? Contact us by [email](mailto:docs@rudderstack.com) or on [Slack](https://rudderstack.com/join-rudderstack-slack-community)",

Add the following line to your [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) `Podfile`:\n\n2.  After adding the dependency, register the `RudderAdjustFactory` with your `RudderClient` initialization as a `factory` of `RudderConfig`. Run the following command to import `RudderAdjustFactory.h` file in your `AppDelegate.m` file:\n\n```\n#import <Rudder-Adjust/RudderAdjustFactory.h>\n```\n\n3.  Then, change the SDK initialization to the following:\n\n```\nRudderConfigBuilder *builder = [[RudderConfigBuilder alloc] init];\n[builder withDataPlaneUrl:DATA_PLANE_URL];\n[builder withFactory:[RudderAdjustFactory instance]];\n[RudderClient getInstance:WRITE_KEY config:[builder build]];\n```\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> This device mode integration is supported for Adjust v4.29.7 and above.\n\nTo add Adjust to your iOS project, follow these steps:\n\n1.  Install `RudderAdjust` (available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) by adding the following line to your `Podfile`):\n\n```\npod 'RudderAdjust', '~> 1.0.0'\n```\n\n2.  Run the `pod install` command.\n    \n3.  Next, import the SDK depending on your preferred platform:\n    \n\n  \n\n4.  Add the imports to your `AppDelegate` file under the `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` method:\n\n```\nlet config: RSConfig = RSConfig(writeKey: WRITE_KEY)\n            .dataPlaneURL(DATA_PLANE_URL)\n\nRSClient.sharedInstance().configure(with: config)\nRSClient.sharedInstance().addDestination(RudderAdjustDestination())\n```\n\n  \n\n```\nRSConfig *config = [[RSConfig alloc] initWithWriteKey:WRITE_KEY];\n[config dataPlaneURL:DATA_PLANE_URL];\n\n[[RSClient sharedInstance] configureWith:config];\n[[RSClient sharedInstance] addDestination:[[RudderAdjustDestination alloc] init]];\n```\n\nTo add Adjust to your Android project, follow these steps:\n\n1.  Add `mavenCentral()` to the `repositories` section of your `build.gradle` file:\n\n```\nrepositories {\n  mavenCentral()\n}\n```\n\n2.  Next, add the following permissions to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:\n\n```\n<uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.INTERNET\"></uses-permission>\n<uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE\"></uses-permission>\n// If you are not targeting the Google Play Store, you need to add the following permission:\n<uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.ACCESS_WIFI_STATE\"></uses-permission>\n// If you are targeting Android 13 and above (API level 33), you need to add the com.google.android.gms.AD_ID permission to read the device's advertising ID.\n<uses-permission android:name=\"com.google.android.gms.permission.AD_ID\"></uses-permission>\n```\n\n3.  Finally, add the following lines in your `build.gradle` file under `dependencies`:\n\n```\n// RudderStack Android-SDK\nimplementation 'com.rudderstack.android.sdk:core:[1.0,2.0)'\n// RudderStack Adjust-SDK\nimplementation 'com.rudderstack.android.integration:adjust:1.0.1'\n// Add Google Play Services library to enable the Google Advertising ID for Adjust SDK\nimplementation 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-ads-identifier:17.0.1'\n// To support the Google Play Referrer API, make sure you have the following in your build.gradle file:\nimplementation 'com.android.installreferrer:installreferrer:2.2'\n```\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> For more information on implementing `com.google.android.gms:play-services-ads-identifier:17.0.1`, refer to the [Adjust documentation](https://help.adjust.com/en/article/get-started-android-sdk#add-google-play-services).\n\n4.  After adding the dependency, register the `RudderAdjustFactory` with your `RudderClient` initialization as a `factory` of `RudderConfig`. Add the following line in your `Application` class:\n\n```\nimport com.rudderstack.android.integration.adjust.AdjustIntegrationFactory;\n```\n\n5.  Finally, change the SDK initialization to the following:\n\n```\nval rudderClient: RudderClient =\n    RudderClient.getInstance(\n        this,\n        WRITE_KEY,\n        RudderConfig.Builder()\n            .withDataPlaneUrl(DATA_PLANE_URL)\n            .withFactory(AdjustIntegrationFactory.FACTORY)\n            .build()\n    )\n```\n\nTo add Adjust to your Unity app, follow these steps:\n\n1.  Add the [RudderStack Unity SDK](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-unity-sdk/) to your project.\n    \n2.  Download the [Adjust SDK extension](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-sdk-unity/tree/master/Integrations/Adjust/RudderAdjust) package and import it in your project.\n    \n\nThe package comes with Adjust Unity SDK embedded in it along with the required `jar` files for Android Install Referrer. **It is strongly recommended to not add the Adjust SDK separately**.\n\n3.  After importing the `rudder-unity-extension-adjust.unitypackage` to your project, attach the `RudderPreferbs.prefab` file from `RudderUnityPlugin` to your main `GameObject`.\n    \n4.  Finally, change the SDK initialization:\n    \n\n```\n// Build your config\nRudderConfigBuilder configBuilder = new RudderConfigBuilder()\n    .WithEndPointUrl(DATA_PLANE_URL)\n    .WithFactory(RudderAdjustIntegrationFactory.GetFactory());\n\n// Get instance for RudderClient\nRudderClient rudderClient = RudderClient.GetInstance(\n    WRITE_KEY,\n    configBuilder.Build()\n);\n```\n\nFollow the below steps to add Adjust to your Flutter Project:\n\n1.  Add the following dependency to the `dependencies` section of your `pubspec.yaml` file.\n\n```\nrudder_integration_adjust_flutter: ^1.0.1\n```\n\n  \n\n2.  Run the below command to install the dependency added in the above step:\n\n  \n\n3.  Import the `RudderIntegrationAdjustFlutter` in your application where you are initializing the SDK.\n\n```\nimport 'package:rudder_integration_adjust_flutter/rudder_integration_adjust_flutter.dart';\n```\n\n  \n\n4.  Finally, change the initialization of your `RudderClient` as shown:\n\n```\nfinal RudderController rudderClient = RudderController.instance;\nRudderConfigBuilder builder = RudderConfigBuilder();\nbuilder.withFactory(RudderIntegrationAdjustFlutter());\nrudderClient.initialize(<write_key>, config: builder.build(), options: null);\n```\n\n## Identify\n\nRudderStack’s [`identify`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/identify/) call lets you identify a visiting user and associate them to their actions.\n\nRudderStack sends the user information in the `identify` call to Adjust’s [`addSessionPartnerParameter`](https://help.adjust.com/en/search?query=addSessionPartnerParameter) method to set the `userId` (or `anonymousId`, in case `userId` is absent), so that the user information is passed to the subsequent calls.\n\nA sample `identify` call is shown below:\n\n```\n[[RudderClient sharedInstance] identify:@\"developer_user_id\"\n                                 traits:@{@\"foo\": @\"bar\", @\"foo1\": @\"bar1\"}];\n```\n\n## Track\n\nThe [`track`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/track/) call lets you record the user actions along with any properties associated with them.\n\nWhen you make a `track` call, RudderStack maps the event name with the corresponding Adjust custom event in the dashboard using Adjust’s [`trackEvent` method](https://help.adjust.com/en/article/ios-sdk-adjust-class#track-event).\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> Make sure you have defined the event mapping in the **Map events to Adjust Event Tokens** dashboard setting. Adjust will reject any events apart from these mappings.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> The event token must already be created and present in the Adjust dashboard. For more information on creating a new event token, refer to the [FAQ](#how-can-i-create-a-new-event-token-in-adjust) section below.\n\n### Sending callback parameters\n\nRudderStack sends all custom properties in your `track` calls as [callback parameters](https://help.adjust.com/en/article/record-events-ios-sdk#add-callback-parameters).\n\nA sample `track` call is shown below:\n\n```\n[[RudderClient sharedInstance] track:@\"test_event\"\n                          properties:@{@\"key\":@\"value\", @\"foo\": @\"bar\"}];\n```\n\n### Sending partner parameters\n\nYou can also send custom properties in your `track` calls as [partner parameters](https://help.adjust.com/en/article/record-events-ios-sdk#add-partner-parameters) to Adjust. Adjust then sends those parameters to the external partners you have set up in your Adjust dashboard.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> For more information on adding a partner in Adjust, refer to the [FAQ](#how-can-i-set-up-new-partners-in-adjust) section below.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> Make sure you have defined the property mapping in the **RudderStack Parameters to Partner Parameters** dashboard setting. Adjust will reject any properties apart from these mappings.\n\nRudderStack uses the property mappings specified in the **RudderStack Parameters to Partner Parameters** setting to check if a key is present in the `track` event properties and maps it to the corresponding Adjust partner parameter object.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> The partner parameters only accept the String data type.\n\nSuppose a customer sets the following mapping in the RudderStack dashboard:\n\n| RudderStack property | Adjust partner parameter |\n| --- | --- |\n| `revenue` | `price` |\n| `quantity` | `quantity` |\n\nA sample `track` call with the above properties is shown below:\n\n```\n[[RudderClient sharedInstance] track:@\"purchase\"\n                          properties:@{@\"revenue\":@20.99,\n                          @\"currency\": @\"USD\",\n                          @\"quantity\": @10}];\n```\n\nThe corresponding Adjust payload highlighting the parameters is shown below:\n\n```\n\"params\": {\n  \"android_id\": \"3f034872-5e28-45a1-9eda-ce22a3e36d1a\",\n  \"gps_adid\": \"3f034872-5e28-45a1-9eda-ce22a3e36d1a\",\n  \"att_status\": 3,\n  \"tracking_enabled\": true,\n  \"currency\": \"USD\",\n  \"ip_address\": \"[::1]\",\n  \"s2s\": 1,\n  \"app_token\": \"t1yurrb968zk\",\n  \"event_token\": \"tf4gm5\",\n  \"environment\": \"production\",\n  \"partner_params\": {\"price\":\"20.99\",\"quantity\":\"10\"}\n},\n```\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack converts numeric values into strings before sending the data to Adjust.\n\n### Sending revenue tracking events\n\nTo send [revenue tracking](https://help.adjust.com/en/article/record-events-ios-sdk#record-event-revenue) events to Adjust, your can add `total` and `currency` to your event properties:\n\n```\n[[RudderClient sharedInstance] track:@\"purchase\"\n                          properties:@{@\"total\":@2.99, @\"currency\": @\"USD\"}];\n```\n\n## Reset\n\nYou can use RudderStack’s [`reset`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/) method to call [`resetSessionCallbackParameters`](https://help.adjust.com/en/search?query=resetSessionCallbackParameters) of the Adjust SDK to reset the user ID and the associated traits.\n\nA sample `reset` call is shown below:\n\n```\n[[RudderClient sharedInstance] reset];\n```\n\n## App install attribution\n\nAdjust’s native SDK handles app install attribution out of the box with RudderStack.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> This feature is not supported when sending events via [cloud mode](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#cloud-mode).\n\n## Adjust environment dependency on log level\n\nRudderStack sends data to the Adjust environment depending on the `RudderLogLevel` set in the SDK, as listed in the below table:\n\n| `RudderLogLevel` | Adjust Environment | Adjust SDK `LogLevel` |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `DEBUG` / `VERBOSE` | Sandbox | `VERBOSE` |\n| `NONE`/ `ERROR` / `WARN`/ `INFO` | Production | `ERROR` |\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> For more information on `RudderLogLevel`, refer to the following SDK documentation:\n> \n> *   [Android](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-android-sdk/#configuring-your-rudderstack-client)\n> *   [iOS](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-ios-sdk/#configuring-the-rudderstack-client)\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### Where can I find the Adjust app token?\n\nTo get your Adjust app token, follow these steps:\n\n1.

    "markdown": "# Mixpanel source | RudderStack Docs\n\nSync data from Mixpanel to your warehouse destination via RudderStack.\n\n* * *\n\n*     5 minute read  \n    \n\n[Mixpanel](https://mixpanel.com/) is an analytics platform that provides specific tools for targeted business communication and customer engagement, in-app A/B testing, user survey forms, and custom reports to measure customer retention.\n\nThis document guides you in setting up Mixpanel as a source in RudderStack. Once configured, RudderStack automatically ingests your Mixpanel data and routes it to your specified data warehouse destination.\n\n## Getting started\n\nTo set up Mixpanel as a source in RudderStack, follow these steps:\n\n1.  Log into your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/).\n2.  Go to **Sources** > **New source** > **Cloud Extract** and select **Mixpanel** from the list of sources.\n3.  Assign a name to your source and click **Continue**.\n\n### Connection settings\n\nEnter the following connection settings to set up the Mixpanel source:\n\n*   **Authentication**: Select either **Service Account** or **Project Secret** from the dropdown to give RudderStack the required permissions to access your Mixpanel account. Refer to the [Service Accounts](https://developer.mixpanel.com/reference/service-accounts) and [Project Secret](https://developer.mixpanel.com/reference/project-secret) documentation for more information on obtaining these details.\n*   **Project ID** : Enter your Mixpanel project ID by going to **Project Settings** > **Overview** in your Mixpanel dashboard. Refer to the [Mixpanel support guide](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004490503-Project-Settings#project-id) for more information.\n*   **Attribution Window**: Specify the time period for attributing results to the ads and the lookback period during which the ads results are counted. By default, this value is set to **5 days**.\n*   **Project Timezone**: Specify your Mixpanel project timezone by going to **Project Settings** > **Project Details** in your Mixpanel dashboard. For more information on getting your Mixpanel project timezone, refer to the [Mixpanel support guide](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004547203-Manage-Timezones-for-Projects-in-Mixpanel).\n*   **Select Properties By Default**: Enable this setting to capture new event properties and engage records. If disabled, these properties will be ignored.\n*   **Start Date**: Select the date from when RudderStack ingests your Mixpanel data.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack will **not replicate** any data before this date. If you do not set this option, RudderStack will replicate the Mixpanel data up to one year from the current date by default.\n\n*   **End Date**: Specify the end date for the replication window.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack will not replicate any data **after** this date. Do not set this field if you want RudderStack to sync the most recent Mixpanel data.\n\n*   **Region**: Specify your Mixpanel domain instance from either **US** or **EU**.\n*   **Date Slicing Window**: Define the window size used to slice through the Mixpanel data. By default, RudderStack sets this field to **30 days**.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Reduce the value of this field if the amount of data in the slicing window is too large for your environment.\n\n### Destination settings\n\nThe following settings specify how RudderStack sends the data ingested from Mixpanel to the connected warehouse destination:\n\n*   **Table prefix**: RudderStack uses this prefix to create a table in your data warehouse and loads all your Mixpanel data into it.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> Note that RudderStack does not add special characters like `-` or `_` to the prefix by default. Hence, you need to specify it while setting the prefix.\n\n*   **Schedule Settings**: RudderStack gives you three options to ingest the data from Mixpanel:\n    *   **Basic**: Runs the syncs at the specified time interval.\n    *   **CRON**: Runs the syncs based on the user-defined CRON expression.\n    *   **Manual**: You are required to run the syncs manually.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> If you have configured **End Date** in the [connection settings](#connection-settings), setting the schedule setting to **Manual** is highly recommended.\n> \n> For this source, RudderStack allows the end date to be less than or equal to the current date. **Basic**/**CRON** scheduling is useful when you want to keep syncing updates for some time in the future as well. By setting the sync schedule to **Manual**, only one sync is required to sync all your Mixpanel data.\n\nFor more information on the schedule types, refer to the [Common Settings](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/extract/common-settings/) guide.\n\n### Selecting the data to import\n\nYou can choose the Mixpanel data you want to ingest by selecting the required resources:\n\n[![Selecting the data to import](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/cloud-extract-sources/mixpanel-connection-settings-2.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/cloud-extract-sources/mixpanel-connection-settings-2.webp)\n\nThe below table mentions the syncs and API endpoints supported by these resources from Mixpanel to your warehouse destination:\n\n| Resource | Sync type | Mixpanel API endpoint |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `revenue` | Incremental | `/engage` |\n| `funnels` | Incremental | `/funnels` |\n| `export` | Incremental | `/export` |\n| `engage` | Incremental | `/engage` |\n| `cohorts` | Incremental | `/cohorts/list` |\n| `cohort_members` | Incremental | `/engage` |\n| `annotations` | Full Refresh | `/annotations` |\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> For more information on the **Full Refresh** and **Incremental** sync modes, refer to the [Common Settings](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/extract/common-settings/#sync-modes) guide.\n\nMixpanel is now configured as a source. RudderStack will start ingesting data from Mixpanel as per your specified schedule and frequency.\n\nYou can further connect this source to your data warehouse by clicking on **Add Destination**:\n\n[![Adding a destination](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/cloud-extract-sources/add-destination.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/cloud-extract-sources/add-destination.webp)\n\n> ![success](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/tick.svg)\n> \n> Use the **Use Existing Destination** option if you have an already-configured data warehouse destination in RudderStack. To configure a data warehouse destination from scratch, select the **Create New Destination** button.\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### Can I connect my Mixpanel source to multiple data warehouse destinations?\n\nYou can connect **only one data warehouse destination** per Cloud Extract source. If you wish to send data to multiple warehouses, you can configure multiple Cloud Extract sources with the same settings and connect them to each data warehouse.\n\nYes, it is.\n\nRudderStack associates a table prefix for every Cloud Extract source writing to a warehouse schema. This way, multiple Cloud Extract sources can write to the same schema with different table prefixes.\n\nRudderStack counts the number of records returned by the source APIs when queried during each sync. It considers each record as an event.\n\nRudderStack sets the table name for the resource you are syncing to the warehouse by adding `rudder_` to the **Table prefix** you set while configuring your Cloud Extract source in the dashboard.\n\n[![Cloud Extract table prefix](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/cloud-extract-sources/etl-table-prefix.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/cloud-extract-sources/etl-table-prefix.webp)\n\nFor example, if you set `test_` as the **Table prefix** in the dashboard, RudderStack sets the table name as `test_rudder_<resource_name>`, where `<resource_name>` is the name of the resource you are syncing (for example, `contacts`, `messages`, etc.).\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> Note that RudderStack does not add the character `_` to the prefix by default. Hence, you need to specify it while setting the prefix.\n\nQuestions? Contact us by [email](mailto:docs@rudderstack.com) or on [Slack](https://rudderstack.com/join-rudderstack-slack-community)",

    "markdown": "# Set up Adobe Analytics | RudderStack Docs\n\nSet up Adobe Analytics as a destination in RudderStack.\n\n* * *\n\n*     9 minute read  \n    \n\nRudderStack supports sending event data to Adobe Analytics via the following [connection modes](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/):\n\n| **Connection Mode** | **Web** | **Mobile** | **Server** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Device Mode** | **Supported** | **Supported** | **\\-** |\n| **Cloud Mode** | **Supported** | **Supported** | **Supported** |\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> In a web device mode integration, that is, using [JavaScript SDK](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/) as a source, the Adobe Analytics native SDK is loaded from `https://cdn.rudderlabs.com` domain. Based on your website’s content security policy, you might need to [allowlist this domain](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/load-js-sdk/#allowlist-destination-domain) to load the Adobe Analytics SDK successfully.\n\nOnce you’ve confirmed that the source platform supports sending data to Adobe Analytics, follow these steps:\n\n1.  From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add a source. Then, from the list of destinations, select **Adobe Analytics**.\n2.  Assign a name to the destination and click **Continue**.\n\n## Connection Settings\n\nTo successfully configure Adobe Analytics as a destination, you will need to configure the following settings:\n\n*   **Tracking Server URL**: Enter the `trackingServer` variable to determine the location where an image request is sent. For example, `jimsbrims.sc.omtrdc.net`. Do not include the `http://` or `https://` in the tracking server URL. Refer to the [Adobe Analytics documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/implementation/vars/config-vars/trackingserver.html?lang=en) for more information.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> If this variable is defined incorrectly, your implementation may experience data loss.\n\n*   **Tracking Server Secure URL**: Enter the `trackingServerSecure` variable to determine the location where an image request is sent over HTTPS. If this variable is not defined correctly, your implementation may experience data loss. Refer to the [Adobe Analytics documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/implementation/vars/config-vars/trackingserversecure.html?lang=en) for more information.\n*   **Report Suite ID(s)**: Enter the Report Suite ID(s) (separated by commas) which can be found in your Adobe Analytics Settings page. For example: `ab.cd`,`ef.gh`,`ij.kl`.\n*   **Check for Heartbeat calls to be made over HTTPS**: If this setting is enabled and the Heartbeat Tracking Server URL is present, RudderStack sets the SSL value to `true` so that the calls go over HTTPS.\n*   **Heartbeat Tracking Server URL**: If assigned, RudderStack uses this as the tracking server URL instead of the URL assigned in the **Tracking Server URL** field. It sets all the heartbeat configurations if you specify this URL. Refer to the [Adobe Analytics documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/media-analytics/using/sdk-implement/setup/setup-overview.html?lang=en) for more information.\n*   **Adobe Analytics JavaScript SDK URL/Heartbeat SDK URL**: Enter the proxy URL where you are hosting the `adobe-analytics-js.js` and `adobe-analytics-js-heartbeat.js`. By default, RudderStack hosts them at [https://cdn.rudderlabs.com/adobe-analytics-js/adobe-analytics-js.js](https://cdn.rudderlabs.com/adobe-analytics-js/adobe-analytics-js.js) and [https://cdn.rudderlabs.com/adobe-analytics-js/adobe-analytics-js-heartbeat.js](https://cdn.rudderlabs.com/adobe-analytics-js/adobe-analytics-js-heartbeat.js) respectively.\n*   **Adobe Heartbeat Settings**: This setting is used to map your RudderStack video events to Adobe Heartbeat Events. Refer to the [Adobe Analytics Heartbeat Measurement](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/adobe-analytics/adobe-analytics-heartbeat/) documentation to find more information.\n\n### Identity Resolution\n\n*   **Marketing Cloud Organization ID**: Enter a value in this field if you want to use `visitorAPI.js`. For example: `99887766ABC@AdobeOrg`.\n*   **Drop Visitor ID**: If enabled, RudderStack does not assign the `userId` to `visitorID`. Refer to the [Adobe Analytics documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/id-service/using/implementation/setup-analytics.html?lang=en#section-6053a6b7c16c466a9f9fdbf9cb9db3df) for more information.\n\n### Timestamps\n\n*   **Timestamp Option**: Adobe Analytics has Report Suites that accept timestamped, non-timestamped or hybrid data. Note that `window.s.timestamp` will be affected. Also, RudderStack sets `visitorID` depending on this value if the **Drop Visitor ID** setting is disabled.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Note that:\n> \n> *   If the timestamp option is disabled, then `visitorID` will be set.\n> *   If timestamp option is set to hybrid and the Prefer Visitor ID setting is on, then `visitorID` will be set.\n> *   For all other cases, RudderStack does not set a `visitorID`.\n> \n> Also note the following regarding timestamps:\n> \n> *   If the timestamp option is enabled, then timestamp will be set.\n> *   If the timestamp option is hybrid and Prefer Visitor ID is off, then timestamp will be set.\n\n*   **Send Both Timestamp and VisitorID for Timestamp Optional Reporting Suites**: This setting lets you choose whether to send both the timestamp and the visitor ID when sending server-side events, in case you are using the [Timestamps Optional Reporting Suite](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/admin/admin-tools/timestamp-optional.html?lang=en).\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> Enabling this setting might lead the data to be out of order. Hence, it is not recommended by Adobe. In order to make it work, you need to enable the **Optional Timestamp** setting in **Reporting Suites**.\n\n*   **No Fallbacks for Visitor ID**: Enable this setting to remove the fallbacks. However, it is applicable only for the server-side events when the **Drop Visitor ID** setting is disabled and **marketingCloudId** is sent in the Adobe Analytics `integrations` object. The priority order of setting the Adobe Analytics visitor ID is the destination-specific setting for `visitorId` > `userId` > `anonymousId`.\n*   **Prefer Visitor ID**: Adobe does not allow sending both `visitorID` and timestamp. Hence, this option is used when the timestamp option is set as hybrid. Also, note that if this option is enabled, RudderStack sets the `visitorID` field. If disabled, RudderStack sets the timestamp value. Refer to the [Adobe Analytics documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/implementation/vars/page-vars/timestamp.html?lang=en) for more information.\n*   **Enable pageName for Track Events**: When enabled, RudderStack only tracks events by sending a `pageName`.\n\n### Mappings\n\n*   **Map Rudder Events to Adobe Custom Events**: This setting allows you to add one or multiple custom Adobe events separated by comma.\n*   **Map Rudder Context data to Adobe Context Data**: Context data variables allow you to you define custom variables on each page that the processing rules apply and can read. Instead of explicitly assigning values to the analytics variables, you can send your data in via these context data variables. The processing rules take the values from the context data variables and pass them into the respective analytics variables.\n\nThis setting allows you to map the key present under the context/properties of the RudderStack message to the property name you want to send to the Adobe context data. An example is as shown below:\n\n```\n\"context\": {\n  \"contextProperties\": {\n    \"prop1\": \"val1\",\n    \"prop2\": \"val2\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIf you want to set `prop1` to Adobe’s context data `property1`, then map with `contextProperties.prop1` –> `property1`.\n\nIf you want to send top level properties `anonymousId`, `messageId`, `event` then simply enter the key.\n\nRefer to the [Adobe Analytics documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/implementation/vars/page-vars/contextdata.html?lang=en) for more information.\n\n*   **Prefix to add before all contextData property**: Specify a prefix to automatically append to your RudderStack properties before sending them as `contextData`.\n*   **Map Rudder Properties to Adobe eVars**: Enter the RudderStack property and the corresponding [eVar’s](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/implementation/vars/page-vars/evar.html?lang=en) index number you want to map before sending to Adobe Analytics. Refer to the [mapping](#mapping-for-evars-and-hierarchy-variables) section for more information on the different values you can specify in the RudderStack property field.\n*   **Map Rudder Properties to Adobe Hierarchy properties**: Enter the RudderStack property and the corresponding [hierarchy variable’s](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/implementation/vars/page-vars/hier.html?lang=en) index number you want to map before sending to Adobe Analytics. Refer to the [mapping](#mapping-for-evars-and-hierarchy-variables) section for more information on different values you can specify in the Rudder property field.\n*   **Map Rudder Properties to Adobe list properties**: Enter the RudderStack property and the corresponding [list’s](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/implementation/vars/page-vars/list.html?lang=en) index number you want to map before sending to Adobe Analytics. You can specify the list properties as an array/string separated by commas. Otherwise, they are dropped.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> For all the list properties you mention in this field, it is mandatory to specify their delimiter in the below setting. The delimiter is used to create the list string for the XML payload.\n\n*   **Map Rudder Property with Delimiters for list properties**: Set any of the delimiters from `, ; / : |`. RudderStack sends the list variables as a string. Any list of properties is delimited using these delimiters.\n*   **Map Rudder Properties to Adobe Custom properties**: Enter the RudderStack property and the corresponding [prop’s](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/implementation/vars/page-vars/prop.html?lang=en) index number you want to map before sending to Adobe Analytics.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> For all the custom properties you mention in this field, it is mandatory to specify their delimiter in the below setting. The delimiter is used to create the props string for the XML payload.\n\n*   **Map Rudder Property with Delimiters for Adobe Custom properties**: Set any of the delimiters from `, ; / : |`. RudderStack sends the list variables as a string. Any list of properties is delimited using these delimiters.\n\n### Merchandise Event Level Settings\n\n*   **Map Rudder Events to Adobe Merchandise events**: This setting lets you map the RudderStack event with an Adobe event of the currency/purchase type. For example: `event5`.\n*   **Currency/Incremental properties to add to merchandise events at event level**: Enter the RudderStack property that has a currency/counter value. RudderStack uses this to create the event string like `purchase,event5=19.9`. It also automatically sets the `currencyCode` value where the default is USD. Refer to the [Adobe Analytics documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/implementation/vars/page-vars/events/events-overview.html?lang=en) for more information.\n\n### Merchandise Product Level Settings\n\n*   **Map Rudder Events to Adobe Merchandise events**: This setting lets you map a RudderStack event with an Adobe event of the currency/purchase type.\n*   **Currency/Incremental properties to add to merchandise events at product level**: Enter the RudderStack property that has a currency/counter value. This will be used to create a product string like `[category][item][quantity][total][incrementor][merchString]`.\n*   **Map Rudder Properties to eVars at product level**: Enter the RudderStack property and the corresponding [eVars](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/implementation/vars/page-vars/evar-merchandising.html?lang=en) index you want to map before sending to Adobe Analytics. RudderStack appends the eVars with `|` and sends it along with the product string. Refer to the [mapping](#mapping-for-evars-and-hierarchy-variables) section for more information on different values you can specify in the Rudder property field.\n*   **Product Identifier**: Choose either of the SKU, ID, or Name of the product as a product identifier.\n\n### Client-side Event Filtering\n\nThis setting is applicable **only if** you are sending events to Adobe Analytics via device mode. It lets you specify which events should be blocked or allowed to flow through to Adobe Analytics. Refer to the [Client-side Event Filtering](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/event-filtering/) guide for more information.\n\n### Consent Settings\n\n*   **OneTrust Cookie Categories**: This setting lets you associate [OneTrust](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/data-governance/consent-management/onetrust/javascript/) cookie consent groups to Adobe Analytics.\n\n## Mapping for evars and hierarchy variables\n\nThis section is applicable **only** for the following connection settings:\n\n*   Map Rudder Properties to Adobe eVars\n*   Map Rudder Properties to eVars at product level\n*   Map Rudder Properties to Adobe Hierarchy properties\n\nYou can specify any of the following values in the **Rudder property** field of the above settings:\n\n*   **Key name**: Specify a key name as the RudderStack property present in the event payload. RudderStack uses the following priority order to find the key name in the event payload: `properties` > `traits` > `context.traits` > `context`\n*   **Absolute path of the key in the event payload**: Specify the exact path of the key in the RudderStack property present in the event payload (in dot notation).

    "markdown": "# Mailchimp source | RudderStack Docs\n\nSync data from Mailchimp to your warehouse destination via RudderStack.\n\n* * *\n\n*     3 minute read  \n    \n\n[Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/) is a popular email marketing automation platform used worldwide by thousands of businesses. Built specially for eCommerce and retail, Mailchimp allows you to build your audience and send them personalized campaign and marketing messages through web or mobile.\n\nThis document guides you in setting up Mailchimp as a source in RudderStack. Once configured, RudderStack automatically ingests your specified Mailchimp data, which can then be routed to your data warehouse destination supported by RudderStack.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nTo set up Mailchimp as a source on the RudderStack dashboard, follow these steps:\n\n*   Log into your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderlabs.com/signup?type=freetrial).\n\n[![RudderStack Dashboard](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/1%20%2815%29%20%281%29.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/1%20%2815%29%20%281%29.webp)\n\n*   Then, click the **Directory** option on the left navigation bar and go to **Cloud Extract** under **Sources**.\n\n[![Directory](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/2%20%2820%29.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/2%20%2820%29.webp)\n\n*   From the list of sources, click **Mailchimp**.\n*   Assign a name to your source, and click **Next**.\n\n[![Mailchimp](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/3%20%2818%29.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/3%20%2818%29.webp)\n\n### Specifying Connection Credentials\n\n*   Next, click the **Connect with Mailchimp** option:\n\n[![Connect with Mailchimp](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/4%20%2817%29.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/4%20%2817%29.webp)\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> If you’ve already configured Mailchimp as a source before, you can choose the account visible under the **Use existing credentials** tab.\n\n*   Authorize RudderStack to access your Mailchimp account:\n\n[![Authorize RudderStack](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/5%20%2818%29.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/5%20%2818%29.webp)\n\n### Configuring the Mailchimp Source\n\n*   Select the **Earliest campaign year** and the **Campaign fetch period** in the settings. The details are as follows:\n    *   **Earliest campaign year**: The first import will fetch all campaign data since the start of the specified year.\n    *   **Campaign fetch period**: All the subsequent imports will fetch the campaign data up to this specified period.\n\n[![Earliest Campaign Year](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/6%20%2816%29.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/6%20%2816%29.webp)\n\n### Setting the Table Prefix, Run Frequency and Data Update Schedule\n\n*   Next, you will be required to set the **Table Prefix**. RudderStack will create a table with this prefix name in your database and load all your Mailchimp data into it.\n*   Also, set the **Run Frequency** to schedule the data import from your Mailchimp account to RudderStack. Optionally, you can also specify the time when you want this synchronization to start, by choosing the time under the **Sync Starting At** option.\n\n[![Google Analytics](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/7%20%2811%29.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/7%20%2811%29.webp)\n\n### Selecting the Data to Import\n\n*   Finally, choose the Mailchimp data that you wish to ingest via RudderStack. You can either select all data, or choose specific Mailchimp attributes, as per your requirement.\n\n[![Ingest via RudderStack](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/8%20%285%29.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/8%20%285%29.webp)\n\nThat’s it! Mailchimp is now successfully configured as a source on your RudderStack dashboard.\n\nRudderStack will start ingesting data from Mailchimp as per the specified frequency. You can further connect this source to your data warehouse by clicking on **Connect Destinations** or **Add Destinations**:\n\n[![Add Destinations](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/9%20%283%29.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/9%20%283%29.webp)\n\n> ![success](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/tick.svg)\n> \n> Use the **Connect Destinations** option if you have already configured a data warehouse destination in RudderStack. To configure a data warehouse destination from scratch, click the **Add Destination** button.\n\n## FAQ\n\nYes, it is.\n\nWe have implemented a feature wherein RudderStack associates a table prefix for every Cloud Extract source writing to a warehouse schema. This way, multiple Cloud Extract sources can write to the same schema with different table prefixes.\n\nRudderStack counts the number of records returned by the source APIs when queried during each sync. It considers each record as an event.\n\nRudderStack sets the table name for the resource you are syncing to the warehouse by adding `rudder_` to the **Table prefix** you set while configuring your Cloud Extract source in the dashboard.\n\n[![Cloud Extract table prefix](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/cloud-extract-sources/etl-table-prefix.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/cloud-extract-sources/etl-table-prefix.webp)\n\nFor example, if you set `test_` as the **Table prefix** in the dashboard, RudderStack sets the table name as `test_rudder_<resource_name>`, where `<resource_name>` is the name of the resource you are syncing (for example, `contacts`, `messages`, etc.).\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> Note that RudderStack does not add the character `_` to the prefix by default. Hence, you need to specify it while setting the prefix.\n\nQuestions? Contact us by [email](mailto:docs@rudderstack.com) or on [Slack](https://rudderstack.com/join-rudderstack-slack-community)",

User tracking events\n2.  [Ecommerce events](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/adobe-analytics/ecommerce-events/)\n3.  [Heartbeat (video) events](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/adobe-analytics/adobe-analytics-heartbeat/)\n\nA sample `track` call is as shown:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"User clicked link\", {\n  category: \"click\",\n  label: \"URL click\"\n})\n```\n\nNote that:\n\n*   Before sending the user tracking and heartbeat `track` events, you must [map them in the RudderStack dashboard](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/adobe-analytics/setting-up-adobe-analytics-in-rudderstack/#connection-settings).\n*   RudderStack sends the ecommerce events to Adobe if they conform to the following mapping:\n\n| RudderStack ecommerce event | Adobe event |\n| --- | --- |\n| `Product Viewed` | `prodView` |\n| `Product List Viewed` | `prodView` |\n| `Product Added` | `scAdd` |\n| `Product Removed` | `scRemove` |\n| `Order Completed` | `purchase` |\n| `Cart Viewed` | `scView` |\n| `Checkout Started` | `scCheckout` |\n| `Cart Opened` | `scOpen` |\n| `Opened Cart` | `scOpen` |\n\n## Page\n\nRudderStack sends a page view event to Adobe Analytics whenever you make a [`page`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/page/) call.\n\nA sample `page` call is as shown:\n\n```\n// Passing page category, name and properties\nrudderanalytics.page(\"category\", \"name\", {\n  path: \"path\",\n  url: \"url\",\n  title: \"title\",\n  search: \"search\",\n  referrer: \"referrer\",\n})\n```\n\nIf this call is made, the `pageName` of the `window.s` variable will be set as **Viewed Page name**. RudderStack also sends other information like `referrer`,`url`, etc.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> For every `page` call, RudderStack sets the mappings done in the dashboard as contextual data, eVars, hiers, lists and props. It calls the `t()` method to compile all the set variables and sends them to Adobe Analytics.\n\n## Overriding Adobe parameters\n\nWhen sending data to Adobe Analytics via cloud mode, RudderStack lets you override the values of certain Adobe parameters in the final XML payload by passing the following event properties:\n\n| Property name | Data type | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `overrideEvars` | Object | Sets the value of the `eVar` tag.<br><br>**Example**:<br><br>{  <br>  “evar1”: “value1”,  <br>  “evar2”: “value2”,  <br>} |\n| `overrideHiers` | Object | Sets the value of the `hier` tag.<br><br>**Example**:<br><br>{  <br>  “hier1”: “oh1”,  <br>  “hier2”: “oh2”,  <br>} |\n| `overrideLists` | Object | Sets the value of the `list` tag.<br><br>**Example**:<br><br>{  <br>  “list1”: “bike, fazer90”  <br>} |\n| `overrideCustomProperties` | Object | Sets the value of the `prop` tag.<br><br>**Example**:<br><br>{  <br>  “property1”: “somevalue”  <br>} |\n| `overrideEventString` | String | Sets the value of the event string.<br><br>**Example**: `scAdd` |\n| `overrideProductString` | String | Sets the value of the product string.<br><br>**Example**:<br><br>\";product1;Games;event1=1\" |\n| `overrideEventName` | String | Fallback for events that are neither mapped or ecommerce events.<br><br>**Example**: `tracking event` |\n| `overridePageView` | Boolean | Send link and page values exclusively.

If already present, they will be used. Otherwise, RudderStack uses the Report Suite IDs, Tracking Server URL, and Tracking Server Secure URL (optional) as set in the RudderStack dashboard.\n\nIf Marketing Cloud Organization ID is set in the dashboard, RudderStack initializes `visitorApi.js` and sets the ID in `window.Visitor.getInstance(<Your Marketing Cloud Org Id>)`.\n\n## Page\n\nRudderStack sends a page view event to Adobe Analytics whenever you make a **`page()`** call.\n\nA sample `page` call is as shown:\n\n```\n// Passing page category, name and properties\nrudderanalytics.page(\"category\", \"name\", {\n  path: \"path\",\n  url: \"url\",\n  title: \"title\",\n  search: \"search\",\n  referrer: \"referrer\",\n})\n```\n\nIf this call is made the `pageName` of the `window.s` variable will be set as **Viewed Page name**. RudderStack also sends other information like `referrer`,`url`, etc.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> The mappings done in the RudderStack dashboard will be set as context data, eVars, hiers, lists and props for every `page` call. The `t()` method is called to compile all variables set and send them to Adobe Analytics.\n\n## Track\n\nAccording to the mapping done in RudderStack, the events can be sent as particular Adobe Events.\n\nThe `track` events for Adobe can be broadly categorized in 3 types:\n\n1.  Normal track events\n2.  Ecommerce track events\n3.  Video type (Heartbeat) track events\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> For the regular and video type (Heartbeat) `track` events, it is necessary to map the events in the RudderStack dashboard.\n\nFor ecommerce track events, if the events fall under the following mapping they will be sent accordingly. Otherwise, the mapping should be done in the dashboard.\n\nThe mapping is as shown:\n\n| Rudder ecommerce event | Adobe event |\n| --- | --- |\n| `product viewed` | `prodView` |\n| `product list viewed` | `prodView` |\n| `product added` | `scAdd` |\n| `product removed` | `scRemove` |\n| `order completed` | `purchase` |\n| `cart viewed` | `scView` |\n| `checkout started` | `scCheckout` |\n| `cart opened` | `scOpen` |\n| `opened cart` | `scOpen` |\n\nA sample `track` call is as shown:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"Track me\", {\n  category: \"category\",\n  label: \"label\",\n  value: \"value\",\n})\n```\n\nQuestions?

    "markdown": "# Stripe | RudderStack Docs\n\nSync data from Stripe to your warehouse destination via RudderStack.\n\n* * *\n\n*     5 minute read  \n    \n\n[Stripe](https://www.stripe.com/) is an online payment processing system for businesses. It offers cutting-edge software and APIs, allowing thousands of businesses to manage online payments.\n\nThis document guides you in setting up Stripe as a source in RudderStack. Once configured, RudderStack automatically ingests your Stripe data and routes it to your specified data warehouse destination.\n\n## Getting started\n\nTo set up Stripe as a source in RudderStack, follow these steps:\n\n1.  Log into your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/).\n2.  Go to **Sources** > **New source** > **Cloud Extract** and select **Stripe** from the list of sources.\n3.  Assign a name to your source and click **Continue**.\n\n### Connection settings\n\nTo set up Stripe as a Cloud Extract source, configure the following settings:\n\n*   **Account ID**: Enter your Stripe account ID (usually starts with `acct_`). You can get it by logging in to your [Stripe dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/) and going to your **Account** settings. For more information on finding your account ID, refer to the [Stripe documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/dashboard/basics#find-account-id).\n*   **Secret Key**: Enter your Stripe API key (usually starts with `sk_live_`). You can get it by going to the [API keys](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys) page. For more information on the secret keys, refer to the [Stripe documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/keys).\n*   **Replication start date**: Select the date from when RudderStack should ingest your Stripe data.\n*   **Lookback window in days**: This setting corresponds to the number of days from when RudderStack starts fetching the data. For example, if you set **Lookback window in days** to `1`, RudderStack fetches data from **Replication start date** - 1.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Use this setting if your data is frequently updated.\n\n*   **Data request time increment in days**: Specify the time window used by RudderStack when requesting the data from Stripe. For example, if you set **Replication start date** to `Jan 01, 2022` and **Data request time increment in days** is set to 365 days, RudderStack fetches data from `Jan 01, 2022` to `Jan 01, 2023`. By default, RudderStack sets this field to `365` days, which is ideal for most use cases.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Note that a higher value for the **Data request time increment in days** setting corresponds to lesser API requests and faster syncs.\n\n### Destination settings\n\nThe following settings specify how RudderStack sends the data ingested from Stripe to the connected warehouse destination:\n\n*   **Table prefix**: RudderStack uses this prefix to create a table in your data warehouse and loads all your Stripe data into it.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> Note that RudderStack does not add special characters like `-` or `_` to the prefix by default. Hence, you need to specify it while setting the prefix.\n\n*   **Schedule Settings**: RudderStack gives you three options to ingest the data from Stripe:\n    *   **Basic**: Runs the syncs at the specified time interval.\n    *   **CRON**: Runs the syncs based on the user-defined CRON expression.\n    *   **Manual**: You are required to run the syncs manually.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> For more information on the schedule types, refer to the [Common Settings](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/extract/common-settings/) guide.\n\n### Selecting the data to import\n\nYou can choose the Stripe data you want to ingest by selecting the required resources. The below table mentions the syncs supported by these resources from Stripe to your warehouse destination where `id` is a common primary key for all:\n\n| Resource | Sync type | Stripe API endpoint |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Balance Transactions | Incremental | [`/balance_transactions`](https://stripe.com/docs/api/balance_transactions) |\n| Bank Accounts | Full Refresh | [`/customers`](https://stripe.com/docs/api/customer_bank_accounts) |\n| Charges | Incremental | [`/charges`](https://stripe.com/docs/api/charges) |\n| Checkout Sessions | Incremental | [`/checkout`](https://stripe.com/docs/api/checkout/sessions) |\n| Checkout Sessions Line Items | Incremental | [`/checkout`](https://stripe.com/docs/api/checkout/sessions/object#checkout_session_object-line_items) |\n| Coupons | Incremental | [`/coupons`](https://stripe.com/docs/api/coupons) |\n| Customer Balance Transactions | Full Refresh | [`/customers`](https://stripe.com/docs/api/customer_balance_transactions) |\n| Customers | Incremental | [`/customers`](https://stripe.com/docs/api/customers) |\n| Disputes | Incremental | [`/disputes`](https://stripe.com/docs/api/disputes) |\n| Events | Incremental | [`/events`](https://stripe.com/docs/api/events) |\n| Invoice Items | Incremental | [`/invoiceitems`](https://stripe.com/docs/api/invoiceitems) |\n| Invoice Line Items | Full Refresh | [`/invoices`](https://stripe.com/docs/api/invoices/line_item) |\n| Invoices | Incremental | [`/invoices`](https://stripe.com/docs/api/invoices) |\n| Payment Intents | Incremental | [`/payment_intents`](https://stripe.com/docs/api/payment_intents) |\n| Payouts | Incremental | [`/payouts`](https://stripe.com/docs/api/payouts) |\n| Promotion Code | Incremental | [`/promotion_codes`](https://stripe.com/docs/api/promotion_codes) |\n| Plans | Incremental | [`/plans`](https://stripe.com/docs/api/plans) |\n| Products | Incremental | [`/products`](https://stripe.com/docs/api/products) |\n| Subscription Items | Full Refresh | [`/subscription_items`](https://stripe.com/docs/api/subscription_items) |\n| Subscriptions | Incremental | [`/subscriptions`](https://stripe.com/docs/api/subscriptions) |\n| Transfers | Incremental | [`/transfers`](https://stripe.com/docs/api/transfers) |\n\nRudderStack captures the updates for the following resources using the [Events API](https://stripe.com/docs/api/events):\n\n*   Charges\n*   Customers\n*   Disputes\n*   Invoices\n*   Invoice Items\n*   Plans\n*   Products\n*   Subscriptions\n*   Transfers\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> For more information on the **Full Refresh** and **Incremental** sync modes, refer to the [Common Settings](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/extract/common-settings/#sync-modes) guide.\n\nStripe is now configured as a source. RudderStack will start ingesting data from Stripe as per your specified schedule and frequency.\n\nYou can further connect this source to your data warehouse by clicking on **Add Destination**:\n\n[![Adding a destination](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/cloud-extract-sources/add-destination.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/cloud-extract-sources/add-destination.webp)\n\n> ![success](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/tick.svg)\n> \n> Use the **Use Existing Destination** option if you have an already-configured data warehouse destination in RudderStack. To configure a data warehouse destination from scratch, select the **Create New Destination** button.\n\n## FAQ\n\nYes, it is.\n\nRudderStack implements a feature wherein it associates a table prefix for every Cloud Extract source writing to a warehouse schema.

    "markdown": "# Shopify extract source | RudderStack Docs\n\nSync data from Shopify to your warehouse destination via RudderStack.\n\n* * *\n\n*     5 minute read  \n    \n\n[Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/in) is a popular ecommerce platform that gives you all tools to start, run, and grow your business effectively. It offers online retailers a variety of services around digital payments, marketing, product shipping, customer engagement and retention, and more.\n\nThis document guides you in setting up Shopify as a source in RudderStack. Once configured, RudderStack automatically ingests your Shopify data and routes it to your specified data warehouse destination.\n\n## Getting started\n\nTo set up Shopify as a source in RudderStack, follow these steps:\n\n1.  Log into your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/).\n2.  Go to **Sources** > **New source** > **Cloud Extract** and select **Shopify** from the list of sources.\n3.  Assign a name to your source and click **Continue**.\n\n### Connection settings\n\nEnter the following connection credentials to set up the Shopify source\n\n[![Shopify credentials](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/cloud-extract-sources/shopify-creds.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/cloud-extract-sources/shopify-creds.webp)\n\n*   **Shopify Store**: Enter the name of your Shopify store from the URL. For example, if your URL is `https://NAME.myshopify.com`, then the store name would be `NAME`.\n*   **Replication Start Date**: Select the date from when RudderStack should ingest your Shopify data. RudderStack will **not replicate** any data before this date.\n*   **API Password**: Enter the Admin API access token which you can obtain by following the below steps:\n\n1.

RudderStack will start ingesting data from Shopify as per your specified schedule and frequency.\n\nYou can further connect this source to your data warehouse by clicking on **Add Destination**, as shown:\n\n[![Adding a destination](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/cloud-extract-sources/add-destination.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/cloud-extract-sources/add-destination.webp)\n\n> ![success](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/tick.svg)\n> \n> Use the **Use Existing Destination** option if you have an already-configured data warehouse destination in RudderStack. To configure a data warehouse destination from scratch, select the **Create New Destination** button.\n\n## FAQ\n\nYes, it is.\n\nRudderStack associates a table prefix for every Cloud Extract source writing to a warehouse schema. This way, multiple Cloud Extract sources can write to the same schema with different table prefixes.\n\nRudderStack counts the number of records returned by the source APIs when queried during each sync. It considers each record as an event.\n\nRudderStack sets the table name for the resource you are syncing to the warehouse by adding `rudder_` to the **Table prefix** you set while configuring your Cloud Extract source in the dashboard.\n\n[![Cloud Extract table prefix](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/cloud-extract-sources/etl-table-prefix.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/cloud-extract-sources/etl-table-prefix.webp)\n\nFor example, if you set `test_` as the **Table prefix** in the dashboard, RudderStack sets the table name as `test_rudder_<resource_name>`, where `<resource_name>` is the name of the resource you are syncing (for example, `contacts`, `messages`, etc.).\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> Note that RudderStack does not add the character `_` to the prefix by default.

These heartbeats are sent to the Adobe heartbeat tracking server every ten seconds to measure the time the video is played.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> For sending the heartbeat events to Adobe Analytics, you will need the Heartbeat Tracking Server URL. To get this URL, contact your Adobe representative. Also, you will need to map your RudderStack events with the type of Adobe heartbeat event you want to send.\n\n## Playback Head\n\nFor sending video heartbeat events to Adobe Analytics through RudderStack’s Web (JavaScript) SDK, Adobe’s Media Heartbeat SDK needs a playhead update at least once every second for the main content. The video/ad start and heartbeat update playhead type of events update this playhead using the `position` property.\n\nTo stop triggering this event for every second, the playhead to the window needs to be set. This can be done by setting `window.rudderHBPlayheads` to the key-value pair of the current content’s `session_id` and `position` as shown:\n\n```\nwindow.rudderHBPlayheads = {\n  \"session_id\": position value\n}\n```\n\nRudderStack sends the Adobe heartbeat events as per the following categories:\n\n## Initialize Heartbeat\n\n*   Adobe Analytics Method Triggered: `trackSessionStart`\n*   Description: This is used for initializing all heartbeat calls.

It offers the ability to view your true marketing ROI, understand your marketing funnel and view your full customer paths. Additionally, Attribution offers a [Data Export](https://www.attributionapp.com/dataexporttool/) feature to let you export all raw data related to campaigns and visitors for your Data Science team to analyze and unlock trends.\n\nRudderStack supports Attribution as a destination to which you can seamlessly send your customer data.\n\n## Getting started\n\nBefore configuring Attribution as a destination in RudderStack, verify if the source platform is supported by Attribution by referring to the table below:\n\n| **Connection Mode** | **Web** | **Mobile** | **Server** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Device Mode** | \\-  | \\-  | \\-  |\n| **Cloud mode** | **Supported** | **Supported** | **Supported** |\n\nOnce you have confirmed that the source platform supports sending events to Attribution, follow these steps:\n\n1.  From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add a source. Then, from the list of destinations, select **Attribution**.\n2.  Assign a name to the destination and click **Continue**.\n3.  Select the data source and click **Next**.\n4.  Enter your Attribution Project key to configure the destination.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> For more information on getting your Attribution project key, refer to the [FAQ](#faq) section below.\n\nYour Attribution destination is now configured and enabled in RudderStack.\n\n## Identify\n\nThe [`identify`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/identify/) call lets you associate a visiting user to their actions. It also lets you record the traits about them like their name, email address, etc.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> As a best practice, make sure that the `identify` call is made at the start of every session or page load for logged-in users. This will ensure all latest user traits are captured.\n\nA sample `identify` call is as shown:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify(\"userid\", {\n  name: \"Alex Keener\",\n  email: \"alex@example.com\",\n  phone: \"+1-202-555-0146\",\n  birthday: \"01/24/1982\",\n  gender: \"Male\",\n  avatar: \"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/alex\",\n  title: \"Mr\",\n})\n```\n\n## Track\n\nThe <[`track`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/track/) call lets you capture user events along with the properties associated with them.\n\nA sample `track` call is as shown:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"Order Completed\", {\n  revenue: 77.6,\n})\n```\n\n## Page\n\nThe [`page`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/page/) call lets you record your website’s page views with any additional relevant information about the viewed page.\n\nA sample `page` call is as shown:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.page(\"Cart\", \"Cart Viewed\", {\n  path: \"/cart\",\n  referrer: \"test.com\",\n  search: \"term\",\n  title: \"test_item\",\n  url: \"http://test.in\",\n})\n```\n\n## Group\n\nThe [`group`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/group/) call lets you link an identified user with a group such as a company, organization, or an account. It also lets you record any custom traits associated with that group like the name of the company, number of employees, etc.\n\nA sample `group` call is as shown:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.group(\"sample-group-id\", {\n  name: \"Example Company\",\n  employees: 1000,\n  industry: \"Software\",\n});\n```\n\n## Alias\n\nThe [`alias`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/alias/) call lets you merge different identities of a known user.\n\nA sample `alias` call is as shown:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.alias(\"to\", \"from\", options, callback)\n```\n\nThe above `alias` call has the following parameters:\n\n| **Parameter** | **Presence** | **Description** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **`to`** | Required | Denotes the new identifier |\n| **`from`** | Optional | Denotes the old identifier which will be an alias for the `to` parameter. If not provided, the SDK will populate this as the currently identified `userId`, or `anonymousId` in case of anonymous users. |\n| **`options`** | Optional | This dictionary provides additional context to the event payload. |\n| **`callback`** | Optional | This function gets executed after successful execution of the **`alias()`** method. |\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### How do I get the Attribution Project Key?\n\nTo get the Attribution Project Key, follow these steps:\n\n1.

Also, enter the corresponding **Mapped Field** - RudderStack takes the value from this field present in the event payload and maps it to the **Schema Field**.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> When using the `PutItems` operation, you need to provide the path to the **Mapped Field** corresponding to the `ITEM_ID` present in your Personalize database schema.\n\n*   **Disable Stringifying Additional Properties**: This setting disables the conversion of additional properties to string data type in Personalize.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> This is an exclusive setting only applicable for the `putEvents` operation. If it is disabled, RudderStack converts any mapped fields other than `ITEM_ID`, `EVENT_VALUE`, `IMPRESSION`, `RECOMMENDATION_ID`, `TIMESTAMP`, `EVENT_TYPE`, and `USER_ID` to a string before forwarding to Personalize.\n\n## Policy permissions\n\nTo use the Personalize destination with RudderStack correctly, you must have a Personalize service set up in AWS. Refer to the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/setup.html) for more information on setting up your Amazon Personalize account.\n\nYou also need to create an IAM role and grant the necessary permissions for RudderStack to send data to Personalize. The following actions need to be attached to the role while setting up the AWS policy:\n\n```\n\"Action\": [\n    \"personalize:PutEvents\",\n    \"personalize:PutUsers\",\n    \"personalize:PutItems\"\n]\n```\n\nYou can use these actions based on the type of Personalize events you want to send. For example, to send only `putEvents` type of events, you can attach only `personalize:PutEvents`.\n\nA sample permissions policy that allows a user to send event data into Personalize is shown below:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n  \"Statement\": [\n    {\n      \"Sid\": \"CloudWatchEventsInvocationAccess\",\n      \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n      \"Action\": [\n        \"personalize:PutEvents\"\n        \"personalize:PutUsers\",\n        \"personalize:PutItems\"\n        ],\n      \"Resource\": \"*\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n## Identify\n\nThe [`identify`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/identify/) call lets you use the `PutUsers` operation of Personalize.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> For the `PutUsers` operation, the value of the `userId` or `anonymousId` field in the payload will be sent as `userId`.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> For `PutUsers`, you must specify the **Dataset ARN** field in the RudderStack dashboard.\n\nThe following snippet highlights a sample `identify` event with the **Mapped Field** setting specified in the dashboard:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify(\"1hKOmRA4GRlm\", {\n  name: \"Alex\",\n  email: \"alex@example.com\"\n  });\n```\n\n## Track\n\nThe [`track`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/track/) call lets you use [`PutEvents`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_UBS_PutEvents.html) and [`PutItems`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/API_UBS_PutItems.html) operations of Personalize.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> For `PutEvents`, RudderStack sends the value of the `event` field in the payload as `EVENT_TYPE`. Also, the value of the `timestamp` or `originalTimestamp` fields in the payload will be sent as `sentAt`.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> For the `PutItems` and `PutEvents` operations, it is mandatory to specify the **Dataset ARN** and **Tracking ID** settings in the RudderStack dashboard.\n\nThe following snippet shows a sample `track` event with the mapped field specified in the dashboard settings:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"Product Added\", {\n  typeOfSdk: \"javascript\",\n  numberOfRatings: \"12\",\n  X: \"item 1\",\n});\n```\n\nWhen using the `PutItems`, the **Schema Field** `ITEM_ID` must be mapped to a specific key inside the payload. You also need to mention the path to the chosen key as the corresponding **Mapped Field**.\n\nIn the above example, if you map `ITEM_ID` to the payload field `X`, the corresponding **Mapped Field** will be `properties.X`.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> For any other **Schema Field** in your `ITEMS` dataset, it is **not** recommended to specify the path - only the field name is sufficient.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> When using `PutEvents`, the **Mapped Field** for `ITEM_ID` should **not** contain the path to the field. Only the name of the field will be sufficient. The same rule is applicable for any other **Schema Field** mapping.\n\nThe following image shows an example of the dashboard configuration for `PutItems`:\n\n[![PutItems](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/putItems.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/putItems.webp)\n\nThe following image shows an example of the dashboard configuration for `PutEvents`:\n\n[![Dashboard Configuration Based On The Above Example](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/putEvents.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/putEvents.webp)\n\nQuestions?

From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add the source. Then, from the list of destinations, select **AWS Lambda**.\n2.  Assign a name to the destination and click **Continue**.\n\n## Connection settings\n\nTo successfully configure AWS Lambda as a destination, you need to configure the following settings:\n\n[![AWS Lambda connection settings](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/aws-lambda-connection-settings-1.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/aws-lambda-connection-settings-1.webp)\n\n*   **Region**: Enter the region associated with your AWS Lambda service.\n\n*   **Role-based Authentication**: Enable this setting to use the RudderStack IAM role for authentication. For more information on creating an AWS IAM role for RudderStack, refer to [this guide](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/aws-iam-role-for-rudderstack/#creating-a-rudderstack-iam-role).\n    *   **IAM Role ARN**: Enter the ARN of the IAM role.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> It is highly recommended to enable this setting as the access keys-based authentication method is now deprecated.\n\n*   If **Role-based Authentication** is disabled, you need to enter the **AWS Access Key ID** and **AWS Secret Access Key** to authorize RudderStack.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> In both the role-based and access key-based authentication methods, you need to set a policy specifying the required permissions for RudderStack to send data to your Lambda function. Refer to the [Policy permissions](#policy-permissions) section below for more information.\n\n*   **Lambda**: Enter the name of the Lambda function to be invoked. RudderStack supports the following formats:\n\n| Name format | Example |\n| --- | --- |\n| Function name | *   `lambda-function` (Name only)<br>*   `lambda-function:v1` (Name with alias) |\n| Function ARN | `arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:123456789012:function:my-function` |\n| Partial ARN | `123456789012:function:lambda-function` |\n\n> ![success](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/tick.svg)\n> \n> You can also append a version number or alias to any of the above formats.\n\n*   **Enable Batch Input**: Enable this setting if your lambda function expects a batch input (array of events) in the event object.\n    *   **Max Batch Size**: If **Enable Batch Input** setting is enabled, use this field to set the maximum size of the event batch.\n*   **Client Context**: Use this field to pass up to **3583 bytes** of Base64-encoded data about the invoking client to the function in the context object.\n\n## Policy permissions\n\nTo use the Lambda destination with RudderStack correctly, you must have a Lambda function set up in AWS. Refer to the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/getting-started.html) for more information on setting up your Lambda function.\n\nYou also need to create an IAM role and grant the necessary permissions for RudderStack to send data to your lambda function. For more information, refer to this [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/access-control-identity-based.html).\n\nThe following permission need to be attached to the role while setting up the policy:\n\n```\n\"Action\": [\"lambda:InvokeFunction\"]\n```\n\nA sample permissions policy that allows a user to send event data into AWS Lambda is shown below:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n  \"Statement\": [\n    {\n      \"Sid\": \"CloudWatchEventsInvocationAccess\",\n      \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n      \"Action\": [\"lambda:InvokeFunction\"],\n      \"Resource\": \"*\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n## Supported events\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> This destination accepts raw event data similar to a webhook. RudderStack sends the entire event payload to AWS Lambda as is, without any transformation or modification.\n\nYou can send your [`identify`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/identify/), [`track`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/track/), [`page`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/page/), [`group`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/group/), and [`alias`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/alias/) events to your lambda function via RudderStack.\n\nRudderStack leverages the [AWS SDK for Go](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/service/lambda/) to send the events to the lambda function. It uses the SDK’s [`Invoke`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/service/lambda/#Lambda.Invoke) method to **asynchronously** invoke the lambda function.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> As RudderStack supports only asynchronous invocation, it only guarantees the order in which the events are triggered. Also, the execution time is completely dependent on the complexity of your lambda function.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> It is highly recommended to configure a [dead-letter queue](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/invocation-async.html#invocation-dlq) to save the discarded events for further processing.\n\n## Viewing error logs\n\nRudderStack does not get any information related to the runtime errors for your lambda function. As a result, you will not be able to view these errors in the [Live Events](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/dashboard-guides/live-events/) tab of your dashboard.\n\nTo view these errors, you can configure the [AWS CloudWatch logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/monitoring-cloudwatchlogs.html) for your lambda function.\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### Why am I getting a `UnrecognizedClientException`/`InvalidSignatureException` error?\n\nIf you’re getting a `UnrecognizedClientException` error with a 403 status code, verify if your AWS credentials (both **AWS Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key**) are valid.\n\nFor the `InvalidSignatureException` error, verify if the provided secret access key is valid.\n\nQuestions?

From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add the source. Then, from the list of destinations, select **Airship**.\n2.  Assign a name to your destination and click **Next**.\n\n### Connection settings\n\nTo successfully configure Airship as a destination, you will need to configure the following settings:\n\n[![Airship connection settings](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/airship-connection-settings.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/airship-connection-settings.webp)\n\n*   **API Key**: Enter your Airship token which is required by RudderStack to communicate with your Airship project and authenticate all supported event calls, that is, [`identify`](#identify), [`track`](#track), and [`group`](#group).\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> For detailed steps on obtaining the API key, refer to the [FAQ](#faq) section below.\n\n*   **App Key**: Enter your Airship project’s app key which is required for the [`track`](#track) calls. You can obtain the app key by going to **Settings** > **Project Details** in your Airship dashboard.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> For detailed steps on obtaining the Airship app key, refer to the [FAQ](#faq) section below.\n\n*   **EU data center**: Enable this setting if you’ve implemented your app in Airship’s European data center.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> If you’re unsure which data center you are on, reach out to [Airship support](mailto:%20docs@rudderstack.com).\n\n## Identify\n\nThe [`identify`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/identify/) call lets you uniquely identify a user and record any associated traits about them like their name, email, etc.\n\nA sample `identify` call is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify(\"1hKOmRA4el9Zt1WSfVJIVo4GRlm\", {\n  likes_movies: true,\n  favorite_color: \"purple\",\n  age: 13\n});\n```\n\nIn the above code snippet, RudderStack sends the Boolean values to Airship as [tags](https://docs.airship.com/api/ua/#operation-api-named_users-tags-post), whereas the non-Boolean values are sent as [attributes](https://docs.airship.com/api/ua/#operation-api-named_users-named_user_id-attributes-post).\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack maps some reserved traits to the predefined Airship attributes. Refer to the [Traits mapping](#traits-mapping) section below for more information.\n\n### Tags\n\nTo successfully assign tags to Airship using the RudderStack `identify` events, you must create a tag group with the group key set to `rudderstack_integration` in Airship.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> For more information on creating a tag group in Airship, refer to the [FAQ](#faq) section below.\n\nThis integration supports `identify` traits of type Boolean only. Airship adds tags for the traits that are set to `true` and removes tags for the traits set to `false`.\n\n### Attributes\n\nFor `identify` traits that are not mapped to any predefined or custom-defined Airship attributes, you must create and enable those attributes in the Airship dashboard.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Refer to the [FAQ](#faq) section below for more information on creating and enabling attributes in Airship.\n\n## Track\n\nThe [`track`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/track/) call lets you capture user events along with the properties associated with them.\n\nRudderStack sends the `track` events to Airship via their [Custom Events API](https://docs.airship.com/api/ua/#operation-api-custom-events-post). You can use the event properties to personalize and trigger specific messages for your audience.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> You need the Airship project’s **App Key** for authenticating the `track` calls.\n\nA sample `track` call is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"Product Clicked\", {\n  description: \"Shoes viewed\",\n  brand: \"Sneakers\",\n  colors: [\"red\", \"blue\"],\n  items: [\n    {\n      text: \"New Balance Sneakers\",\n      price: \"$69.95\"\n    },\n    {\n      text: \"G.I. Joe Sneakers\",\n      price: \"$99.95\"\n    }\n  ]\n});\n```\n\nThe event name sent to Airship must not contain any upper case characters. Otherwise, it is rejected with a `400` status code. RudderStack handles this by converting any upper case characters to lower case and replacing any spaces with an underscore(`_`).\n\nIn the snippet above, the event name `Product Clicked` is automatically converted to `product_clicked` before sending to Airship.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack also maps some event properties to the Airship properties before sending them over to Airship. For more information, refer to the [Supported mappings](#supported-mapping) section below.\n\n## Group\n\nThe [`group`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/group/) call lets you link an identified user with a group such as a company, organization, or an account, and record any traits associated with that group, e.g., company name, number of employees, etc.\n\nA sample `group` call is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.group({\n  userId: \"1hKOmRA4el9Zt1WSfVJIVo4GRlm\",\n  likes_movies: true,\n  age: 13\n});\n```\n\nIn the above code snippet, RudderStack sends the Boolean values to Airship as [tags](https://docs.airship.com/api/ua/#operation-api-named_users-tags-post), whereas the non-Boolean values are sent as [attributes](https://docs.airship.com/api/ua/#operation-api-named_users-named_user_id-attributes-post).\n\nThis integration supports `group` traits of type Boolean only. Airship adds tags for the traits that are set to `true` and removes tags for the traits set to `false`.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> To successfully assign tags to Airship using the RudderStack `group` events, you must create a tag group with the group key set to `rudderstack_integration_group` in Airship. Similarly, you need to create the relevant attribute identifiers in Airship to set the attributes on the named users.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> For more information on creating a tag group or attributes in Airship, refer to the [FAQ](#faq) section below.\n\n## Supported mappings\n\nRudderStack maps the following event properties to the Airship properties before sending them over to Airship.\n\n| RudderStack property | Airship property | Presence |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `userId` | `named_user_id` | Required |\n| `event` | `name` | Required |\n| `properties` | `properties` | Optional |\n| `value` | `value` | Optional |\n| `interactionId` | `interaction_id` | Optional |\n| `interactionType` | `interaction_type` | Optional |\n| `sessionId` | `session_id` | Optional |\n| `transaction` | `transaction` | Optional |\n| `timestamp` | `occurred` | Optional |\n\n### Traits mapping\n\n| RudderStack trait | Airship attribute |\n| --- | --- |\n| `address.city` | `city` |\n| `address.country` | `country` |\n| `address.postalcode` | `zipcode` |\n| `address.state` | `region` |\n| `createdAt` | `account_creation` |\n| `firstName` | `first_name` |\n| `lastName` | `last_name` |\n| `name` | `full_name` |\n| `phone` | `mobile_phone` |\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### Where can I obtain the Airship API key?\n\nThe Airship API key is required so that RudderStack can communicate with your Airship project. This is a mandatory field to set up the integration.\n\nTo obtain your Airship project’s API key, follow these steps:\n\n1.  In your Airship dashboard, go to **Settings**.\n2.  In the **Project configuration** window, go to **Tokens** and click **Manage**.\n3.  Then, click **Create token**.\n4.  Assign a name for your token.

Once the token is created, copy and secure the credentials and click **Got it**.\n\n#### Where can I obtain the Airship App Key?\n\nTo obtain your Airship project’s app key, follow these steps:\n\n1.  In your Airship dashboard, go to **Settings**.\n2.  In the **Project configuration** window, look for the **Project Details** pane on the right side.\n\nYou will find your project’s app key listed here.\n\n#### How do I create a custom tag group in Airship?\n\nTo create a tag group in Airship, follow these steps:\n\n1.  Go to **Settings** > **Project configuration** > **Tag Groups** and click **Manage**.\n2.  Click **Create Tag Group** and enter the following settings:\n    *   **Name**: Enter the name for the tag group.\n    *   **Description**: Set additional information about the tag group in this field.\n    *   **Group Key**: Assign a unique ID for the tag group in this field. For example, to assign tags using the RudderStack `identify` events, you can set this to `rudderstack-integration`. For assigning tags using the `group` events, set this to `rudderstack-integration-group`.\n\nFor more information, refer to the [Airship documentation](https://docs.airship.com/guides/messaging/user-guide/audience/segmentation/tags/#creating-custom-tag-groups).\n\n#### How do I create and enable attributes in Airship?\n\nFor `identify` traits that are not mapped to any predefined or custom-defined Airship attributes, you must create and enable those attributes in the Airship dashboard. To do so, follow these steps:\n\n1.  Go to your Airship dashboard.\n2.  Navigate to **Audience** > **Attributes**.\n3.  Click **Create Attribute**.\n4.  Enter the **Attribute ID**, **Name**, and select the attribute **Type**.\n5.  Finally, click **Add**.\n\n[![Airship new attributes](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/new-attribute-airship.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/new-attribute-airship.webp)\n\nQuestions?

It helps businesses build and optimize their users’ product search and discovery experience, resulting in enhanced online engagement, increased conversion rates, and better user lifetime value.\n\nRudderStack supports Algolia Insights as a destination to which you can seamlessly send your customer data.\n\n## Getting started\n\nBefore configuring Algolia Insights as a destination in RudderStack, verify if the source platform is supported by Algolia by referring to the table below:\n\n| **Connection Mode** | **Web** | **Mobile** | **Server** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Device mode** | \\-  | \\-  | \\-  |\n| **Cloud mode** | **Supported** | **Supported** | **Supported** |\n\nOnce you have confirmed that your source platform supports sending events to Algolia, follow these steps:\n\n*   From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add the source. From the list of destinations, select **Algolia**.\n*   Assign a name to the destination and click **Next**. You should then see the following screen:\n\n[![](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/Algolia.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/Algolia.webp)\n\n### Connection settings\n\nThis section details the connection settings required to configure Algolia as a destination in RudderStack.\n\n*   Enter your Algolia **API Key** and **Application ID**.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> To get the Algolia API key and Application ID, go to your [Algolia dashboard](https://www.algolia.com/apps/). Under the **API Keys** menu, copy the values under **Application ID** and **Search-Only API Key**.\n\n*   Under **Event Settings**, you can add the **Event Name** and its corresponding **Event Type**. These are optional fields and can also be passed via the `track` call.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> The `event`\\-`eventType` mapping passed via the `track` call **will get a higher precedence** over the mapping specified in the dashboard.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> If the `event`\\-`eventType` mapping is not specified in the dashboard and these fields are not passed in the `track` call as well, then the event will be discarded.\n\n*   Finally, click **Next**. Algolia will now be enabled as a destination in RudderStack.\n\n## Track\n\nThe `track` call lets you send events related to your customers’ product usage. The required fields are `event`, `eventType`, `index`, and either `objectIds` or `filters`.\n\nNote that the **Event Name** (`event`) and **Event Type** (`eventType`) can be mapped in the dashboard while configuring the destination. Note that the `eventType` value set in `properties` in the `track` call will have a higher precedence over the dashboard mapping.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> In case you have already specified the mapping in the dashboard, you don’t need to send the same `eventType` in the `track` call.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> To send a new `event` via `track` which is not specified in the dashboard, make sure you include the `eventType` inside the `properties` of the call. Otherwise, the event will be **discarded**.\n\nThe following table includes all `track` fields with their relative mapping to the Algolia fields:\n\n| **RudderStack Field** | **Algolia Field** | **Criteria** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `index` | `index` |     |\n| `eventType` | `eventType` |     |\n| `timestamp` | `timestamp` |     |\n| `queryId` | `queryID` |     |\n| `filters` | `filters` |     |\n| `objectIds` | `objectIDs` |     |\n| `positions` | `positions` |     |\n| `message.properties.eventSubtype` | `eventSubtype` | Applicable if `eventType` is `conversion`. Allowed values for `eventSubtype` are `addToCart`, and `purchase`. |\n| `message.properties.value` | `value` |     |\n| `properties.currency` | `currency` | Required field if you send `value` and `products` array where any product’s information contains `price`/`quantity`/`discount`. |\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack looks for these fields within the `properties` field of the event payload. `userId` or `anonymousId` is mapped to `userToken` in Algolia.\n\nA sample `track` call is as shown:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"event name\", {\n  eventType: \"click\",\n  index: \"index1\",\n  timestamp: 1630649198801,\n  objectIds: [\"objId1\", \"objId2\"],\n  positions: [1, 2],\n  queryId: \"e28d338dbfbbdcb4678d9d30a5e286ee\"\n});\n```\n\nTo successfully send events to Algolia, the following criteria must be met:\n\n| **Field** | **Criteria** |\n| --- | --- |\n| `eventType` | Values can only be either of `click`, `view` or `conversion`. Otherwise, the event will be discarded. |\n| `timestamp` | Must be in milliseconds UNIX epoch and must be maximum 4 days old. |\n| `queryId` | Must be a 32-character Hexadecimal string. |\n| `filters` | Must be an array of strings. **If it has more than 10 strings, only the first 10 values will be passed**. |\n| `objectIds` | Must be an array of strings. **If it has more than 20 strings, only the first 20 values will be passed**. |\n| `positions` | Must be an array of integers. **It must be passed for only `click` type events. Only the first 20 values will be passed**. |\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> For all event types (`eventType`), either `filters` or `objectIds` must be passed and **not both**. If both or none of the fields are passed, the event will be discarded.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> For the `click` event type, if you pass `objectIds`, then you must pass either **both** or **none** of the `positions` and `queryId` fields. If only either of the fields are present, the event will be discarded.\n> \n> Also, the length of `objectIds` and `positions` arrays should be equal. Otherwise, the event will be discarded.\n\n### Ecommerce events\n\nFor Algolia Insights, RudderStack supports the `products` array for two ecommerce events - [Product List Viewed](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/ecommerce-events-spec/browsing/#product-list-viewed) and [Order Completed](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/ecommerce-events-spec/ordering/#order-completed).\n\nAn example is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"product list viewed\", {\n  index: \"index1\",\n  products: [\n    {\n      objectId: \"objectId\",\n      position: 1\n    }\n  ]\n});\n```\n\nRudderstack also supports sending DataObjects, if you send the `products` array for `conversion` event type:\n\n| **RudderStack Product Property** | **Algolia Data Object Property** | **Criteria** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `message.properties.products[#i].queryID` | `queryID` | \\-  |\n| `message.properties.products[#i].price` | `price` | `message.properties.currency` must be present. |\n| `message.properties.products[#i].quantity` | `quantity` | `message.properties.currency` must be present. |\n| `message.properties.products[#i].discount` | `discount` | `message.properties.currency` must be present. |\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### What happens if the Event Name - Event Type mapping is not specified in the dashboard as well as in the `track` call?\n\nIf the **Event** - **Event Type** mapping is not specified in the dashboard and these fields are not passed in the `track` call as well, then the event will be discarded.\n\nQuestions?

    "markdown": "# Azure Blob Storage | RudderStack Docs\n\nSend your event data from RudderStack to Microsoft Azure Blob Storage.\n\n* * *\n\n*     4 minute read  \n    \n\n[Azure Blob Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/services/storage/blobs/) is Microsoft’s cloud-based object storage solution. It provides scalable and secure storage for high-performance workloads, cloud native apps, machine learning, and more.\n\nRudderStack supports sending your event data from a variety of sources to your Azure Blob Storage container.\n\n## Setting up Azure Blob Storage\n\nFollow these steps to set up Azure Blob Storage before adding it as a destination in RudderStack:\n\n1.  Login to your [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).\n2.  Click **Create a resource** and click **Create** under **Storage account**.\n3.  [Create a storage account](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-create?tabs=azure-portal) of type [Standard general-purpose v2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-overview#types-of-storage-accounts).\n4.  Next, choose your storage account and click **Containers** under **Data storage** .\n5.  Create a new container. This is where RudderStack will store all your event data.\n6.  You also need to provide an access key to authorize RudderStack to write to your container. Under **Security + networking**, click **Access keys**. You can find your access keys here.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Note the storage account name, container as well as access key. This information is required to set up Azure Blob Storage as a destination in RudderStack.\n\n7.  If you wish to grant limited access to your Azure Storage resources, you can use the Shared Access Signatures (SAS) instead of your access key. To generate a SAS token, go to **Security + networking** > **Shared Access Signature**.\n\n### SAS token permissions\n\nYou can use the shared access signatures (SAS) to delegate specific permissions to your storage account resources. This gives you granular control over how users can access your data.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> For more information on shared access signatures (SAS) and how to use them, refer to this [Azure documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-sas-overview).\n\nFor your Blob Storage destination, RudderStack requires the **Write** permission to write to your container. Make sure it is checked in the **Allowed permissions** setting. An example is shown below:\n\n[![Setting SAS token permissions](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/sas-token-permissions.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/sas-token-permissions.webp)\n\nIf you’re using Blob Storage as an intermediate object storage for your data warehouse destinations, you need to assign the following permissions for your SAS token:\n\n| Warehouse destination | Minimum required permissions |\n| --- | --- |\n| Azure Data Lake | Read, Write |\n| Azure Synapse | Read, Write |\n| Clickhouse | Read, Write |\n| Databricks Delta Lake | Read, Write |\n| Microsoft SQL Server | Read, Write |\n| PostgreSQL | Read, Write |\n| Snowflake | Read, Write |\n\n## Configuring Azure Blob Storage in RudderStack\n\nTo enable dumping data to Microsoft Azure Blob Storage, you will first need to add it as a destination in RudderStack. Once the destination is configured and enabled, events from RudderStack will start flowing to your Azure Blob Storage container.\n\nFollow these steps to add Blob Storage as a destination in RudderStack:\n\n1.  From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add a source. Then, from the list of destinations, select **Azure Blob Storage**.\n2.  Assign a name to the destination and click **Continue**.\n\n### Connection settings\n\nTo successfully configure Azure Blob Storage as a destination, you will need to configure the following settings:\n\n[![Azure Blob Storage connection settings](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/azure-blob-storage-connection-1.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/azure-blob-storage-connection-1.webp)\n\n*   **Azure Blob Storage Container Name**: Enter the name of your Blob Storage container used to store the data.\n*   **Prefix**: If specified, RudderStack will create a folder in the bucket with this prefix and push all data within that folder. For example, `https://<account_name>.blob.core.windows.net/<container_name>/<prefix>/`\n*   **Azure Blob Storage Account Name**: Enter your Azure Blob Storage account name that you copied in the [Setting up Azure Blob Storage](#setting-up-azure-blob-storage) section above.\n*   **Azure Blob Storage Account Key**: This option is only applicable if **Use shared access signature (SAS) Tokens** is **disabled**. In that case, enter the access key associated with your Blob Storage account.\n*   **Use shared access signature (SAS) Tokens**: Enable this setting to use a shared access signature (SAS) token to grant limited access to your Azure storage resources.\n\n[![Azure Blob Storage connection settings](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/azure-blob-storage-connection-2.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/azure-blob-storage-connection-2.webp)\n\n*   **Azure Blob Storage SAS Token**: If **Use shared access signature (SAS) Tokens** is enabled, enter your Blob Storage SAS token generated in the **Step 7** of the [Setting up Azure Blob Storage](#setting-up-azure-blob-storage) section above.\n\nMicrosoft Azure Blob Storage is successfully added as a destination in RudderStack. Once you send an event from your source, RudderStack will send it to your specified Blob Storage container.\n\nQuestions?

    "markdown": "# AdRoll | RudderStack Docs\n\nSend your event data from RudderStack to AdRoll.\n\n* * *\n\n*     5 minute read  \n    \n\n[AdRoll](https://www.adroll.com/) is a digital and growth marketing platform that lets you display relevant ads, engage with your customers, and grow your revenue.\n\nRudderStack supports AdRoll as a destination to which you can seamlessly send your event data.\n\n## Getting started\n\nRudderStack supports sending event data to AdRoll via the following [connection modes](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/):\n\n| **Connection Mode** | **Web** | **Mobile** | **Server** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Device mode** | **Supported** | \\-  | \\-  |\n| **Cloud mode** | \\-  | \\-  | \\-  |\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> In a web device mode integration, that is, using [JavaScript SDK](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/) as a source, the AdRoll native SDK is loaded from `https://s.adroll.com/` domain. Based on your website’s content security policy, you might need to [allowlist this domain](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/load-js-sdk/#allowlist-destination-domain) to load the AdRoll SDK successfully.\n\nOnce you have confirmed that the source platform supports sending events to AdRoll, follow these steps:\n\n1.  From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add a source. Then, from the list of destinations, select **AdRoll**.\n2.  Assign a name to the destination and click **Next**.\n\n### Connection settings\n\nTo successfully configure AdRoll as a destination, you will need to configure the following settings:\n\n[![AdRoll connection settings](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/adroll-connection-settings.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/adroll-connection-settings.webp)\n\n*   **Advertiser ID**: Enter your AdRoll advertiser ID here.\n*   **Pixel ID**: Enter your AdRoll pixel ID here.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> For more information on getting your AdRoll advertiser ID and pixel ID, refer to the [FAQ](#faq) section below.\n\n*   **Mapping to trigger the AdRoll Segment ID for the resepective event name**: Enter the event names which you want to map to specific AdRoll audience segments.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> For more information on creating new audiences in AdRoll and getting the audience segment ID, refer to the [FAQ](#faq) section below.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> When sending events via device mode, RudderStack lets you specify which events should be discarded or allowed to flow through. For more information, refer to the [Client-side Event Filtering](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/event-filtering/) guide.\n\n*   **Use device mode to send events**: As this is a web device mode-only destination, this setting is enabled by default and cannot be disabled.\n\n## Identify\n\nThe [`identify`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/identify/) method lets you identify a user and associate them to their actions. It also lets you record any traits about them like their name, email, etc.\n\nA sample `identify` call is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify(\"1hKOmRA4GRlm\", {\n  email: \"alex@example.com\"\n});\n```\n\nRudderStack uses the `identify` call to set a `userId` which is passed to AdRoll every time a subsequent `track` call is made.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> `email` is a required attribute for successfully making an `identify` call. RudderStack maps `email` to AdRoll’s `window._adroll_email` property.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> It is not mandatory to make an `identify` call every time before making a `track` call.\n\n## Track\n\nThe [`track`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/track/) method lets you capture user events along with the properties associated with them.\n\nRudderStack uses `track` events to segment your users in AdRoll.\n\nA sample `track` call is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"Order Completed\", {\n  order_id: \"123454387\",\n  products: [\n    {\n      product_id: \"345676543\",\n      sku: \"G214\",\n      name: \"Cards\",\n      price: 14.99,\n      position: 1,\n      category: \"Games\",\n      url: \"https://www.estore.com/best-seller/1\"\n    }\n  ]\n});\n```\n\nTo use the RudderStack `track` calls to segment users in AdRoll, you must first create an audience segment in AdRoll. Then, you need to map the audience ID to your corresponding event in the RudderStack dashboard:\n\n[![AdRoll event mapping to audience](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/adroll-event-mapping.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/adroll-event-mapping.webp)\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> For more information on creating an audience in AdRoll and mapping it to your events, refer to the [FAQ](#faq) section below.\n\nWhen the mapped event is triggered, the appropiate pixel is fired in AdRoll and the user is segmented in the audience.\n\n### Property mapping\n\nRudderStack maps the following event properties to the corresponding AdRoll attributes:\n\n| RudderStack property | AdRoll attribute | Comments |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `revenue` | `adroll_conversion_value` | \\-  |\n| `userId` | `user_id` | \\-  |\n| `price` | `adroll_conversion_value` | Mapped only for the product type events, for example, `Product Clicked`, `Product Viewed`, `Product Added`. |\n| `orderId` | `order_id` | \\-  |\n| `currency` | `adroll_currency` | \\-  |\n\n## Page\n\nThe [`page`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/page/) method lets you record your website’s page views with any additional relevant information about the viewed page.\n\nRudderStack internally uses the `page` and `track` calls to segment your users.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> For RudderStack to successfully send both `page` and `track` calls to AdRoll, the events must be mapped to the AdRoll audience segment ID in the RudderStack dashboard.\n\nA sample `page` call is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.page(\"Best Seller\", {\n  path: \"/best-seller/1\",\n  referrer: \"https://www.google.com/search?q=estore+bestseller\",\n  search: \"estore bestseller\",\n  title: \"The best sellers offered by EStore\",\n  url: \"https://www.estore.com/best-seller/1\"\n});\n```\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### Where can I find the AdRoll advertiser ID and pixel ID?\n\nTo find the AdRoll advertiser ID and pixel ID, follow these steps:\n\n1.  Log into your [AdRoll dashboard](https://app.adroll.com/).\n2.  In the left sidebar, go to **Website** under **Audiences**.\n3.  Under the **AdRoll Pixel** section, click **View Pixel**:\n\n[![AdRoll view Pixel](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/adroll-pixel.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/adroll-pixel.webp)\n\n4.  In the resulting pop-up, you can find your AdRoll advertiser ID associated with the `adroll_adv_id` parameter. You can also find the AdRoll pixel ID associated with the `adroll_pix_id` parameter:\n\n[![AdRoll advertiser ID and Pixel ID](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/adroll-details.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/adroll-details.webp)\n\n#### How do I create a new audience segment in AdRoll?\n\nTo create a new audience segment in AdRoll, follow these steps:\n\n1.  Log into your [AdRoll dashboard](https://app.adroll.com/).\n2.  In the left sidebar, go to **Website** under **Audiences**.\n3.  Click **New Audience**:\n\n[![AdRoll new audience](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/adroll-new-audience.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/adroll-new-audience.webp)\n\n4.  Enter the name of the audience segment in the **Audience Name** field.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Make sure you copy the ID before creating the audience by clicking the **Copy ID to clipboard** link.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack supports only the **conversion audience** type, so make sure you check the **This is a conversion audience** option.\n\n[![AdRoll new audience](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/adroll-new-audience-settings.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/adroll-new-audience-settings.webp)\n\n5.  Specify the **Conversion Value** and the duration for which the user should be a part of this audience segment.\n6.  Finally, click **Create Audience**.\n\nYou can then specify the ID you copied above in the RudderStack dashboard to map specific events to your audience segment:\n\n[![AdRoll event mapping to audience](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/adroll-event-mapping.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/adroll-event-mapping.webp)\n\nQuestions?

From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add the source. Then, from the list of destinations, select **BigQuery Stream**.\n2.  Assign a name to the destination and click **Continue**.\n\n[![BigQuery Stream connection settings](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/bqstream-2.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/bqstream-2.webp)\n\n## Connection settings\n\nTo successfully configure BigQuery Stream as a destination, you will need to configure the following settings:\n\n*   **Project ID**: Enter your BigQuery project ID.\n*   **Dataset ID**: This is the ID of the project dataset for which you specified the **Project ID** above.\n*   **Table ID**: Provide the ID of the table into which you want to stream the event data.\n\n[![BigQuery Stream connection settings](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/bqstream-3.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/bqstream-3.webp)\n\n*   **Insert ID**: This is an **optional** field. Enter the `insertId` used by Google to deduplicate the data sent to BigQuery. For more information on this setting, refer to the [Deduplicating data](#deduplicating-data) section.\n*   **Credentials**: Enter the contents of the credentials JSON you downloaded after [creating your service account](#creating-a-service-account).\n\n## Sending events to BigQuery Stream\n\nRudderStack supports sending only [`track`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/track/) events to BigQuery Stream. Make sure your `track` event payload format matches the table schema corresponding to **Table ID** specified in the dashboard settings.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack currently does not support the `templateSupportSuffix` feature which creates a table schema during a streaming insert action.\n\nSuppose you want to stream the events from your web source to BigQuery and the table schema in your BigQuery dataset is as shown:\n\n[![BigQuery table schema](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/bqstream-5.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/bqstream-5.webp)\n\nTo successfully stream the events, the event tracked from your JavaScript SDK should look like the following:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"event\", {\n  productId: 10,\n  productName: `Product-10`,\n  count: 12\n});\n```\n\nNote that the `track` properties in the above payload match with the fields specified in your table schema. Once streamed, you can view this event in your BigQuery console by running the following SQL command :\n\n[![BigQuery result](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/bqstream-6.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/bqstream-6.webp)\n\n## Deduplicating data\n\nGoogle leverages the `insertId` to deduplicate the data sent to BigQuery. `insertId` is essentially an event property that uniquely identifies an event.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack currently supports only **numeric** or **string** values as `insertId`.\n\nFor more information on the deduplication process in BigQuery, refer to the [BigQuery documentation](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/streaming-data-into-bigquery#dataconsistency).\n\n### Use case\n\nConsider the following table schema:\n\n[![BigQuery table schema](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/bqstream-5.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/bqstream-5.webp)\n\nWhen sending an `Insert Product` event to BigQuery, you can use the `productId` field to uniquely identify the product. Upon setting `productId` as the `insertId`, BigQuery uses it to deduplicate the data.\n\n## Dynamically configuring `insertId`\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n\nTo dynamically configure `insertId` via the event payload, make sure that `insertId` is the column name present in your schema (or in the `properties` object in the event payload) used to uniquely identify an event.\n\nConsider the following schema:\n\n[![BigQuery table schema](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/bqstream-5.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/bqstream-5.webp)\n\nSuppose you have a dynamic configuration like `{{ message.uniqueId || \"productId\" }}` for the above schema. There are three cases to consider here:\n\n### Case 1: Unique ID is sent as a value which is not a key in the event properties\n\nConsider the following payload:\n\n```\n{\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"productId\": 212,\n    \"productName\": \"my product\",\n    \"count\": 24\n  },\n  ...,\n  \"uniqueId\": <some_value> ,\n  ...\n}\n```\n\nIn the above case, deduplication **is not applicable** as the event properties do not contain `<some_value>` present in the payload.\n\n### Case 2: Unique ID is sent as a value which is a key in the event properties\n\nConsider the following payload:\n\n```\n{\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"productId\": 212,\n    \"productName\": \"my product\",\n    \"count\": 24\n  },\n  ...,\n  \"uniqueId\": \"productId\",\n  ...\n}\n```\n\nIn this case, deduplication **is applicable** as RudderStack sends the `productId` value (`212`) as the `insertId` to Google.\n\n### Case 3: Unique ID is not sent in the event payload\n\nConsider the following payload:\n\n```\n{\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"productId\": 212,\n    \"productName\": \"my product\",\n    \"count\": 24\n  },\n  ...\n}\n```\n\nIn this case, deduplication **is applicable** as RudderStack sends the `productId` value (`212`) as the `insertId` to Google.\n\nIf you use the dynamic destination configuration for `insertId` by passing a random value (e.g. `1234`) in the above payload, deduplication will **not be applicable** as the `properties` object does not contain the value `1234`.\n\n## Creating a service account\n\nTo create a service account in your [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/), follow these steps:\n\n1.  In the left sidebar, go to **APIs & Services** > **Credentials**.\n2.  Then, click **CREATE CREDENTIALS** > **Service account**:\n\n[![Service account under Create Credentials](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/bqstream-service-account-1.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/bqstream-service-account-1.webp)\n\n3.  Enter the service account details and click **CREATE AND CONTINUE**.\n4.  In the **Select a role** field, search and select the **BigQuery Data Editor** role and click **CONTINUE**.\n\n[![BigQuery User role](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/bqstream-service-account-4.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/bqstream-service-account-4.webp)\n\n5.  Click **DONE** to finish the setup.\n6.  Next, you need the service account credentials JSON required for RudderStack to send the data to BigQuery. To obtain this JSON, go to your service account.\n\n[![Service account](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/bqstream-service-account-2.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/bqstream-service-account-2.webp)\n\n7.  Then, go to **KEYS** > **ADD KEY** > **Create new key**.\n8.  Select the **Key type** as **JSON** and click **CREATE**.\n\n[![Service account type](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/bqstream-service-account-3.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/bqstream-service-account-3.webp)\n\nYour JSON key will be automatically downloaded. Copy and paste the contents of this JSON key in the **Credentials** field while [configuring BigQuery Stream as a destination](#connection-settings) in RudderStack.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nFor the different error messages you might get when sending your event data to BigQuery Stream and their troubleshooting steps, refer to the [BigQuery documentation](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/error-messages).\n\nQuestions?

For the `track` events, you can specify the event name based on the event name in the payload. For example:\n\n*   If the event name is `page`, RudderStack sends all events with the `type` set to `page`.\n*   If event name is `Product Added` , RudderStack sends all track events with the `event` as `Product Added`.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> To send all events to a particular stream irrespective of the type or name, you can use `*` as the event name in the dashboard settings.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> Note that the field **Delivery Stream Name** is case sensitive and has to be specified exactly as named in AWS. On the other hand, the **Event Name** field is not case sensitive, and thus RudderStack does not differentiate between `Page` or `page` before sending it to the Firehose stream.\n\n## Policy permissions\n\nTo use the Firehose destination with RudderStack correctly, you must have a Firehose stream created in AWS. For more information on creating a Kinesis Firehose data delivery stream, refer to this [AWS documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/basic-create.html).\n\nYou also need to create an IAM role and attach the policy containing the necessary permissions (`PutRecord`) for RudderStack to write to the stream.\n\n*   To create an IAM role, follow the instructions on [Creating an IAM role](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-user.html#roles-creatingrole-user-console).\n*   For more information on creating an IAM policy, refer to this [AWS documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_create.html).\n\nA sample permissions policy that allows a user to send event data into Kinesis Firehose is shown below:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n  \"Statement\": [\n    {\n      \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n      \"Action\": [\n        \"firehose:PutRecord\"\n      ],\n      \"Resource\": [\n        \"arn:aws:firehose:{region}:{account-id}:stream/{stream-name}\"\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### How does event mapping work with the delivery stream?\n\n*   If there is no delivery stream set for an event in the dashboard settings, RudderStack will not send the event to the Firehose stream.\n*   If an event is set with a delivery stream, RudderStack sends the payload to the configured delivery stream.\n*   If you have set the event `type`, **Event Name**, and `*` for mapping purposes, RudderStack gives the topmost priority to the event name, followed by `type`, and then `*`. For example, if the type of event is `track` and **Event Name** is `Product Added`, RudderStack does the mapping as shown:\n\n[![](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/screenshot-2020-07-14-at-10.37.02-pm.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/screenshot-2020-07-14-at-10.37.02-pm.webp)\n\nThen all events go to the stream mapped with `Product Added`.\n\nQuestions?

    "markdown": "# Bing Ads destination | RudderStack Docs\n\nSend your event data from RudderStack to Bing Ads.\n\n* * *\n\n*     3 minute read  \n    \n\n[Bing Ads](https://ads.microsoft.com/) is an advertising platform that lets you track and monitor ad campaigns, clicks, CTRs, etc. You can also implement efficient ad retargeting for your customers.\n\nFind the open source JavaScript SDK code for this destination in our [Github repository](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-sdk-js/tree/production/src/integrations/BingAds).\n\n## Getting started\n\nRudderStack supports sending event data to Bing Ads via the following [connection modes](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/):\n\n| Connection Mode | Web | Mobile | Server |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Device mode | **Supported** | \\-  | \\-  |\n| Cloud mode | \\-  | \\-  | \\-  |\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack loads the Bing Ads native SDK from the `https://bat.bing.com/` domain in the web device mode integration. Based on your website’s content security policy, you might need to [allowlist this domain](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/load-js-sdk/#allowlist-destination-domain) to load the Bing Ads SDK successfully.\n\nOnce you have confirmed that the platform supports sending events to Bing Ads, follow these steps:\n\n1.  From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add a source. Then, from the list of destinations, select **Bing Ads**.\n2.  Assign a name to the destination and click **Continue**.\n\n## Connection settings\n\nTo successfully configure Bing Ads as a destination, you will need to configure the following settings:\n\n*   **Tag ID**: Enter the UET tag ID associated with your Bing Ads account. You can create a UET tag by logging in to your [Bing Ads account](https://ads.microsoft.com/) and navigating to **Tools** > **Conversion Tracking** > **UET tag** > **Create UET tag**. For detailed instructions, see [Bing Ads documentation](https://about.ads.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/training/universal-event-tracking).\n*   **Client-side Events Filtering**: This setting lets you specify which events should be blocked or allowed to flow through to Bing Ads. For more information on this setting, see [Client-side Events Filtering](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/event-filtering/).\n*   **OneTrust Cookie Categories**: This setting lets you associate [OneTrust](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/data-governance/consent-management/onetrust/javascript/) cookie consent groups to Bing Ads.\n*   **Use device mode to send events**: As Bing Ads is a [web device mode](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#device-mode)\\-only destination, this setting is enabled by default.\n\n## Page\n\nYou can make a [`page`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/page/) call to Bing Ads to record a page view. The web SDK will send this data to Bing Ads with the event type as `pageLoad`.\n\nThe following snippet highlights a sample `page` call:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.page(\"Cart\", \"Cart Viewed\", {\n  path: \"/cart\",\n  referrer: \"test.com\",\n  search: \"term\",\n  title: \"test_item\",\n  url: \"http://test.in\",\n})\n```\n\n## Track\n\nYou can use the [`track`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/track/) call to capture user events and their associated properties.\n\n### Supported mappings\n\nThe following table details the mappings between RudderStack and Bing Ads properties:\n\n| RudderStack property | Bing Ads property | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `properties.event_action`  <br>`message.type` | `event` | Event action. |\n| `properties.ecomm_pagetype`  <br>`properties.pagetype` | `ecomm_pagetype` | Viewed page type. |\n| `properties.products.$.product_id`  <br>`properties.products.$.sku`<br><br>If `products` array is absent, then:<br><br>`properties.product_id`  <br>`properties.sku` | `ecomm_prodid` | Product identifier. |\n| `properties.query` | `search_term`  <br>`ecomm_query` | Search query. |\n| `properties.ecomm_category`  <br>`properties.category_id` | `ecomm_category` | Category ID for the category browse page. |\n| `properties.total`  <br>`properties.value` | `ecomm_totalvalue` | Total value of all items in the transaction. |\n| `properties.transaction_id`  <br>`properties.order_id`  <br>`properties.checkout_id` | `transaction_id` | Unique ID for the transaction. |\n| `properties.products.$.product_id`  <br>`properties.products.$.sku`  <br>`properties.products.$.quantity`  <br>`properties.products.$.price`<br><br>If `products` array is absent, then:<br><br>`properties.product_id`  <br>`properties.sku`  <br>`properties.quantity`  <br>`properties.price` | `items`<br><br>(id, quantity, price) | Product details like product ID, quantity, price. |\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> Note that:\n> \n> *   RudderStack prioritizes `properties.total` over `properties.revenue` followed by `properties.value`, before mapping it to the Bing Ads’ `revenue` property.\n> *   Bing Ads accepts the following values for `properties.ecomm_pagetype`/`properties.pagetype` (mapped to `ecomm_pagetype`).\n>     *   `other` (default value)\n>     *   `home`\n>     *   `category`\n>     *   `searchresults`\n>     *   `product`\n>     *   `cart`\n>     *   `purchase`\n> *   Bing Ads allows a maximum of 50 characters for the `product_id`/`sku` properties (mapped to `ecomm_prodid`).\n> *   You can override the default RudderStack mappings with the Bing Ads UET parameters by passing them directly in the event payload. For example, passing `ecomm_totalvalue` in the payload overrides the RudderStack properties `properties.total`/`properties.value` (mapped to `ecomm_totalvalue`). However, note that this functionality is **not applicable** for the `items` parameter.\n> \n> For more information on the UET parameters, see the [Bing Ads documentation](https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/ads/en/60123/-1).\n\nA sample `track` call looks like the following:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"Item Purchased\", {\n  category: \"MyCategory\",\n  currency: \"INR\",\n  total: 5,\n  revenue: 125,\n  value: 100,\n})\n```\n\nQuestions?

    "markdown": "# Amplitude Destination | RudderStack Docs\n\nSend data from RudderStack to Amplitude.\n\n* * *\n\n*     26 minute read  \n    \n\n[Amplitude](https://amplitude.com/) is a comprehensive product analytics service for web and mobile platforms. 12,000+ companies use Amplitude to get marketing insights that drive product strategy, conversion, and customer retention.\n\nRudderStack provides native libraries for Amplitude integrations for the following languages:\n\n*   [Android](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-integration-amplitude-android)\n*   [iOS: Obj-C](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-integration-amplitude-ios)\n*   [iOS: Swift](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-integration-amplitude-swift)\n\n## Getting started\n\nThe Amplitude destination supports `alias`, `group`, `identify`, `page`, `screen`, and `track` calls.\n\nBefore configuring Amplitude as a destination in RudderStack, confirm that your source is supported by Amplitude by referring to the table below. See [connection modes](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/) for details.\n\n| **Connection Mode** | **Web** | **Mobile** | **Server** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Device mode** | **Supported** | **Supported** | \\-  |\n| **Cloud mode** | **Supported** | **Supported** | **Supported** |\n\n## Connection settings\n\n1.  If you haven’t already, first create a source in your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/). Your source will be where you intend on sending data from. See [Sources](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/dashboard-guides/sources/) to learn more.\n2.  Connect your source to Amplitude. You can do this directly from your source by navigating to **Overview** > **Add Destination** > **Create a New Destination**. Or, you can create the Amplitude destination first by navigating to **Destinations** > **New Destination** in your dashboard.\n3.  Verify that your desired source is supported by Amplitude by referencing the **Connection Modes** table above.\n4.  In the **Connection Settings** modal, provide the following information:\n\n*   **Name**: Choose a name for your destination that will be easily identifiable later. Often, users like to include suffixes such as `-prod`, `-dev`, `-testing` to differentiate connection environments.\n*   **API key**: To find your API key, go to your project in Amplitude and look in the general tab.\n*   **Residency server**: Choose whether you want to connect to Amplitude’s Standard Server (US) or EU-based residency server.\n\n5.  Choose the connection mode for each of your sources. This determines how your data will be routed from your source to your destination. Learn more about cloud mode vs. device mode [here](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/). We recommend using cloud mode as you will have access to Transformations and more reliable performance (compared to device mode).\n6.  Press **Continue** to create your connection.\n7.  Review the [Configuration settings](#configuration-settings) to ensure that you are OK with all of the default settings and/or to customize your settings further.\n8.  Once you are happy with your settings, toggle the **Enable** switch at the top of your Configurations page to begin sending events to Amplitude.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> See [RudderStack SDK settings](#rudderstack-sdk-settings) for more information on the SDK-specific settings you can configure while sending events to Amplitude.\n\n## Adding device mode integration\n\nOnce you add Amplitude as a destination in the [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), follow these steps to add it to your project depending on your integration platform:\n\nFollow these steps to add Amplitude to your iOS project:\n\n1.  In your `Podfile`, add the `Rudder-Amplitude` extension:\n\n```\npod 'Rudder-Amplitude'\npod 'Amplitude', '~> 7.2.0'\n```\n\n2.  After adding the dependency followed by `pod install` , you can add the imports to your `AppDelegate.m` file as shown:\n\n```\n#import <rudder>\n#import \"RudderAmplitudeFactory.h\"\n// for using IDFA as device id, location listening only\n#import <amplitude>\n```\n\n3.  Also add the initialization of your `RSClient` as shown:\n\n```\nRSConfigBuilder *builder = [[RSConfigBuilder alloc] init];\n[builder withDataPlaneUrl:DATA_PLANE_URL];\n[builder withFactory:[RudderAmplitudeFactory instance]];\n[RSClient getInstance:WRITE_KEY config:[builder build]];\n```\n\n4.  Add the below logic just after initializing `RudderClient` in `AppDelegate.m` if you would like to send `IDFA` of iOS device as `device id` to Amplitude\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> Make sure that you enable `use IDFA as device id` under `iOS SDK settings` on dashboard.\n\n```\n// for using IDFA as device id only\n[Amplitude instance].adSupportBlock = ^{\n    return [[ASIdentifierManager sharedManager] advertisingIdentifier];\n};\n```\n\n5.  Add the below logic to track location (latitude, longitude):\n\n```\n[Amplitude instance].locationInfoBlock = ^{\n        return @{\n                @\"lat\" : @37.7,\n                @\"lng\" : @122.4\n              };\n};\n```\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> This device mode integration is supported for Amplitude v8.8.0 and above.\n\nFollow these steps to add Amplitude to your iOS project:\n\n1.  Install `RudderAmplitude` (available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/)) by adding the following line to your `Podfile`:\n\n```\npod 'RudderAmplitude', '~> 1.0.0'\n```\n\n2.  Run the `pod install` command.\n3.  Then, import the SDK depending on your preferred platform:\n\n  \n\n4.  Next, add the imports to your `AppDelegate` file under the `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` method:\n\n```\nlet config: RSConfig = RSConfig(writeKey: WRITE_KEY)\n            .dataPlaneURL(DATA_PLANE_URL)\n\nRSClient.sharedInstance().configure(with: config)\nRSClient.sharedInstance().addDestination(RudderAmplitudeDestination())\n```\n\n  \n\n```\nRSConfig *config = [[RSConfig alloc] initWithWriteKey:WRITE_KEY];\n[config dataPlaneURL:DATA_PLANE_URL];\n\n[[RSClient sharedInstance] configureWith:config];\n[[RSClient sharedInstance] addDestination:[[RudderAmplitudeDestination alloc] init]];\n```\n\nTo add Amplitude to your Android Project please follow these steps :\n\n1.  Open your `app/build.gradle` (Module: app) file, and add the following under the `dependencies` section :\n\n```\nimplementation 'com.rudderstack.android.sdk:core:1.+'\nimplementation 'com.rudderstack.android.integration:amplitude:1.+'\nimplementation 'com.google.code.gson:gson:2.8.6'\n\n// Amplitude\nimplementation 'com.amplitude:android-sdk:2.25.2'\nimplementation 'com.squareup.okhttp3:okhttp:4.2.2'\n\n// For using Google Advertising Id as device id\nimplementation 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-ads:18.3.0'\n```\n\n2.  Initialize the RudderStack SDK in the `onCreate()` method of the `Application` class as following:\n\n```\n// initializing Rudder SDK\nval rudderClient =\n    RudderClient.getInstance(\n        this,\n        WRITE_KEY,\n        RudderConfig.Builder()\n            .withDataPlaneUrl(DATA_PLANE_URL)\n            .withFactory(AmplitudeIntegrationFactory.FACTORY)\n            .build()\n    )\n```\n\n3.  To send `Google Advertising Id` of the device as `device id` to the Amplitude, add the below code in the `AndroidManifest.xml` of your app under `<application>` tag:\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Make sure that you enable `Use Advertising ID for Device ID` under `Android SDK settings` on the [dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/)\n\n```\n<meta-data android:name=\"com.google.android.gms.ads.AD_MANAGER_APP\" android:value=\"true\"></meta-data>\n```\n\nTo add Amplitude to your React Native project:\n\n1.  Add the RudderStack-Amplitude module to your app using either of the following ways:\n\n```\nnpm install @rudderstack/rudder-integration-amplitude-react-native\n```\n\nOR  \n\n```\nyarn add @rudderstack/rudder-integration-amplitude-react-native\n```\n\n2.  Import the module added above and add it to your SDK initialization code as shown:\n\n```\nimport rudderClient from \"@rudderstack/rudder-sdk-react-native\"\nimport amplitude from \"@rudderstack/rudder-integration-amplitude-react-native\"\nconst config = {\n  dataPlaneUrl: DATA_PLANE_URL,\n  trackAppLifecycleEvents: true,\n  withFactories: [amplitude],\n}\nrudderClient.setup(WRITE_KEY, config)\n```\n\nFollow the below steps to add Amplitude to your Flutter Project:\n\n1.  Add the following dependency to the `dependencies` section of your `pubspec.yaml` file.\n\n```\nrudder_integration_amplitude_flutter: ^1.0.1\n```\n\n2.  Run the below command to install the dependency added in the above step:\n\n3.  Import the `RudderIntegrationAmplitudeFlutter` in your application where you are initializing the SDK.\n\n```\nimport 'package:rudder_integration_amplitude_flutter/rudder_integration_amplitude_flutter.dart';\n```\n\n4.  Finally, change the initialization of your `RudderClient` as shown:\n\n```\nfinal RudderController rudderClient = RudderController.instance;\nRudderConfigBuilder builder = RudderConfigBuilder();\nbuilder.withFactory(RudderIntegrationAmplitudeFlutter());\nrudderClient.initialize(<write_key>, config: builder.build(), options: null);\n```\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> For iOS platform, make sure that the minimum deployment target for your application’s target is at least 10.\n\n## Configuration settings\n\nConfigure how you want your events to be sent to Amplitude directly in your RudderStack dashboard without touching any code.\n\n### Page settings\n\nThis section allows you to set how you want your [`page`](#page) calls to be sent to Amplitude.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> Checking your event volume setup with Amplitude prior to configuring this section is recommended.\n\nThe following settings are only applicable when you’ve connected a source in [web device mode](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#device-mode).\n\n| Field | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Track all pages | Toggling this on will send all `page` events to Amplitude as `Loaded a page`. |\n| Track categorized pages | When this setting is turned on:<br><br>*   If `useNewPageEventNameFormat` is set to true in the integration options, RudderStack sends events to Amplitude as `Viewed {category} Page`.<br>*   Otherwise, it sends the events to Amplitude as `Viewed page {category}`. |\n| Track named pages | When this setting is turned on:<br><br>*   If `useNewPageEventNameFormat` is set to true in the integration options, RudderStack sends events to Amplitude as `Viewed {name} Page`.<br>*   Otherwise, it sends the events to Amplitude as `Viewed page {name}`. |\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> If you enable more than one of the above settings, RudderStack may send multiple events to Amplitude for a single `page` event.\n\nThe following settings are only applicable when you’ve connected a source in [mobile device mode](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#device-mode):\n\n| Field | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Track all pages | If you toggle on this setting and `name` is present in your `screen` event properties, RudderStack sends the event to Amplitude as `Viewed {name} Screen`.

Amplitude computes `device_family` as `device_family: {device_brand} {device_manufacturer} {device_model}`. | Only supported for mobile sources in device mode. |\n\n#### Ecommerce settings\n\nThese settings allow you to define how you want your `Order Completed` events to be passed to Amplitude.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> These settings are applicable for the events sent in cloud mode and web device mode.\n\n| Field | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Track products as single event | Turn this on to track an array of products as a single event. The event will be passed as the original event name, and all products as properties. Otherwise, each product is tracked as a separate event with the name `Product purchased`. |\n| Track revenue per product | Turn this on to track the revenue of each product in an event individually. Otherwise, the event will be sent as an aggregate revenue of all products. |\n\n### Other settings\n\n#### Client-side events filtering\n\nRudderStack’s [client-side event filtering](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/event-filtering/) feature lets you specify which events should be discarded or allowed to flow through by allowlisting or denylisting them.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> This is only applicable for destinations that are connecting in device mode and implementing track calls. For mobile SDKs, it also applies to the following application lifecycle events: installed, opened, backgrounded, updated.\n\n1.  Select whether you would like to turn on events filtering.\n    *   The default setting is **No events filtering**, meaning that no filters are applied and RudderStack will allow all events to flow through.\n    *   Select **Allowlist** if you would like to be able to specify the names of the events that you want RudderStack to allow to flow through to the destination. Any events you do not list in the subsequent modals will be blocked.\n    *   Select **Denylist** if you would like to be able to specify the names of the events that you want RudderStack to block from flowing to the destination. Any events you do not list in the subsequent modals will be allowed to flow through to the destination.\n2.  Input event names to **Allowlist** (only possible if Allowlist was selected above): provide the event name(s) you would like to allow to flow through to the destination. Input one event name per line, and click **add more** for each additional event name you would like to add to the list. Note that any event names that you do not add to this list will be blocked.\n3.  Input event names to **Denylist** (only possible if Denylist was selected above): provide the event name(s) you would like to block from flowing to the destination. Input one event name per line, and click **add more** for each additional event name you would like to add to the list. Note that any event names that you do not add to this list will be allowed to flow through to the destination.\n\n#### OneTrust cookie categories\n\nOneTrust is a popular consent management platform that provides data governance, privacy management, and security solutions to thousands of businesses worldwide.\n\nRudderStack’s JavaScript SDK integrates seamlessly with the OneTrust SDK. It lets you map the OneTrust cookie/consent groups to RudderStack’s consent purposes. RudderStack, in turn, uses this consent information to enable/disable tracking and sending the data.\n\nTo use this feature, ensure that you have activated the integration by following the steps outlined in the [OneTrust Consent Manager](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/data-governance/consent-management/onetrust/javascript/) integration for the JavaScript SDK.\n\n| Field | Description | Note |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Category name | Input the consent category name(s) defined when you set up OneTrust for your JavaScript source. | Insert one category name per line. |\n\nSee [OneTrust Consent Manager](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/data-governance/consent-management/onetrust/javascript/) in our JavaScript SDK docs to learn more.\n\n## RudderStack SDK settings\n\nYou can also define the following settings in your RudderStack SDK while sending events to Amplitude:\n\n| Field | Description | Note |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `residencyServer` | Sets the Amplitude server zone.<br><br>**Default value**: `AMPServerZone.US` | Configurable values are `AMPServerZone.US` and `AMPServerZone.EU`. |\n| `useBatch`  <br>Applicable only for the [Android SDK](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-android-sdk/). | Determines whether to use the `batch` API.<br><br>**Default value**: `True` | The value for **Batch event upload threshold** dashboard setting should be greater than `0`. |\n\n## Amplitude SDK settings\n\nThe following settings let you customize the Amplitude SDK when sending events via the device mode. Make sure to add the Amplitude SDK to your project before configuring these settings.\n\n### Web\n\nIf you are connecting to Amplitude in web device mode, these settings allow you to configure Amplitude’s native web SDK.\n\n| Field | Description | Note |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Proxy server URL | Use this setting to send data to Amplitude using a [domain proxy](https://www.docs.developers.amplitude.com/analytics/domain-proxy/) to relay event requests. | Make sure that the proxy server URL is of a secure protocol type (HTTPS). Otherwise, RudderStack drops the proxy domain information and sends the data to Amplitude directly, without using the proxy domain. |\n| Replace Device ID with Anonymous ID | When turned on, RudderStack uses `anonymousId` instead of the device ID. | RudderStack’s JavaScript SDK generates the `anonymousId`. To set your own `anonymousId`, use the [`setAnonymousId()`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/supported-api/#overriding-anonymous-id) method. |\n| Disable Attribution | When turned on, RudderStack does not track attribution using the GCLID, UTM parameters, and referrer information. | \\-  |\n| Save Referrer, URL params, GCLID only once per session | When turned on, RudderStack tracks referrer, UTM parameters, and GCLID only once per session and ignores any new values that may enter a user’s session. | \\-  |\n| Batch event upload period (ms) | Set the time limit (in ms) between batch uploads. | \\-  |\n| Batch event upload threshold | Set the minimum number of events to be sent in a batch. | \\-  |\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> With the latest Amplitude SDK updates, the following configuration settings are now removed from the RudderStack dashboard:\n> \n> *   **Force HTTPS**\n> *   **Track GCLID**\n> *   **Track referrer information**\n> *   **Track UTM properties**\n> *   **Reset referrer or UTM params for new sessions**\n> *   **Batch events prior to upload**\n> \n> For older Amplitude web device mode configurations, the above settings will still be applicable. However, you will **not** be able to modify/update them. To do so, [contact RudderStack support](mailto:support@rudderstack.com).\n> \n> RudderStack will continue to support the above settings for the next two months, after which they will be set to the following default values:\n> \n> *   **Force HTTPS**: false\n> *   **Track GCLID**: false\n> *   **Track referrer information**: false\n> *   **Track UTM properties**: false\n> *   **Reset referrer or UTM params for new sessions**: false\n> *   **Batch events prior to upload**: false\n\n### iOS\n\nIf you are connecting to Amplitude in mobile device mode, these settings allow you to configure Amplitude’s native iOS SDK.\n\n| Field | Description | Note |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Track session events | Turning this on will send start and end session events. | Mobile device mode only |\n| Use IDFA for device ID | Turning this on will send the IDFA instead of device ID to Amplitude. | Mobile device mode only |\n| Batch event upload period (ms) | Set the time limit (in ms) between batch uploads. | Mobile device mode only |\n| Batch event upload threshold | Set the minimum number of events to be sent in a batch. | Mobile device mode only |\n\n### Android\n\nIf you are connecting to Amplitude in mobile device mode, these settings allow you to configure Amplitude’s native Android SDK.\n\n| Field | Description | Note |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Enable location listening | When on, capture user location information for anyone who has granted app location permission. | Mobile device mode only |\n| Track session events | Turning this on will send start and end session events. | Mobile device mode only |\n| Use advertising ID for device ID | Turning this on will send Advertising ID instead of Device ID to Amplitude. | Mobile device mode only |\n| Batch event upload period (ms) | Set the time limit (in ms) between batch uploads. | Mobile device mode only |\n| Batch event upload threshold | Set the minimum number of events to be sent in a batch. | Mobile device mode only |\n\n### React Native\n\nIf you are connecting to Amplitude in [mobile device mode](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#device-mode), these settings allow you to configure Amplitude’s native Android and iOS SDKs:\n\n| Field | Description | Applicable platform |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Track session events | Turning this on causes RudderStack to send the session start and end events. | iOS and Android |\n| Use IDFA for device ID | Turning this on causes RudderStack to send the IDFA to Amplitude instead of device ID. | iOS |\n| Batch event upload period (ms) | Set the time limit (in ms) between batch uploads. | iOS and Android |\n| Batch event upload threshold | Set the minimum number of events to send in a batch. | iOS and Android |\n| Enable location listening | Turning this on causes RudderStack to capture user location information for anyone who has granted the app location permission. | Android |\n| Use advertising ID for device ID | Turning this on causes RudderStack to send the advertising ID to Amplitude instead of device ID. | Android |\n\n## Identify\n\nThe `identify` call lets you associate a user with their actions and capture all relevant traits about them. This information includes unique `userId` as well as any optional information such as name, email address, etc.\n\nA sample `identify` call looks like the following:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify(\n  \"userId\", {\n    email: \"name@surname.com\",\n    name: \"John Doe\",\n    profession: \"Student\",\n  })\n```\n\nA sample dashboard after making the above `identify`, `page`, and `track` calls is as follows:\n\n[![Adjust connection settings](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/screenshot-2020-02-17-at-5.41.41-pm.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/screenshot-2020-02-17-at-5.41.41-pm.webp)\n\n[![Adjust connection settings](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/screenshot-2020-02-17-at-5.49.05-pm.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/screenshot-2020-02-17-at-5.49.05-pm.webp)\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> **Applicable for mobile only**: If a trait has a name `optOutOfSession` with a value of `true`, then this `identify` call will be opted out of the current session if it exists or won’t start a new session if there isn’t any active session.\n> \n> **Opting out of sessions**: You can opt out of an identify call (of a current session) by passing a trait named `optOutOfSession` as `true`. When there is no active session, passing `optOutOfSession` does not start a new session.\n\n### Unset user properties\n\nTo unset the user traits set in the `traits`/`context.traits` object or `userProperties` in Amplitude, specify them in the `integrations.Amplitude.fieldsToUnset` object.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> When you unset fields using `fieldsToUnset`, RudderStack notifies Amplitude to delete the fields along with their schema (if they exist). For more information, see the following Amplitude documentation:\n> \n> *   [Cloud mode](https://www.docs.developers.amplitude.com/analytics/apis/http-v2-api/#keys-for-the-event-argument:~:text=exceed%2040%20layers.-,user_properties,-Optional.%20Object.%20A)\n> *   [Device mode](https://amplitude.github.io/Amplitude-JavaScript/Identify#identifyunset)\n\nFor the following sample payload:\n\n```\nmessage: {\n  \"channel\": \"web\",\n  \"type\": \"identify\",\n  \"context\": {\n    \"traits\": {\n      \"firstName\": \"Alex\",\n      \"lastName\": \"Keener\",\n    },\n  },\n},\n```\n\nTo unset `firstName` and `lastName` fields in Amplitude, you can set the following `integrations` object of your `identify` event payload:\n\n```\nmessage: {\n  \"integrations\": {\n    \"Amplitude\": {\n      \"fieldsToUnset\": [\"firstName\", \"lastName\"]\n    },\n    \"All\": true,\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIf the fields are within some object:\n\n```\nmessage: {\n  \"channel\": \"web\",\n  \"type\": \"identify\",\n  \"context\": {\n    \"traits\": {\n      \"someField\": {\n        \"firstName\": \"Alex\",\n        \"lastName\": \"Keener\"\n      }\n    },\n  },\n},\n```\n\nTo unset `firstName` and `lastName` in this case, set the `integrations` object as follows:\n\n```\nmessage: {\n  \"integrations\": {\n    \"Amplitude\": {\n      \"fieldsToUnset\": [\"someField.firstName\", \"someField.lastName\"]\n    },\n    \"All\": true,\n  }\n}\n```\n\nFor the following sample `identify` event:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify(\"userId\", {\n  \"firstName\": \"Alex\",\n  \"outerObject\": {\n    \"innerObject\": {\n      \"lastName\": \"Keener\"\n    }\n  }\n});\n```\n\nTo unset `firstName` and `lastName`, set the `integrations` object in your `identify` event as follows:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify(\"userId\", {}, {\n  integrations: {\n    Amplitude: {\n      \"fieldsToUnset\": [\"firstName\", \"outerObject.innerObject.lastName\"]\n    }\n  }\n})\n```\n\n## Page\n\nThe `page` call allows you to record information whenever a user sees a web page, along with the associated optional properties of that page. This method must be called at least once per page load.\n\nA sample `page` call looks like the following:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.page({\n  userId: \"user_id\",\n  category: \"Category\",\n  name: \"Sample\",\n})\n```\n\nIn the above sample, we capture information related to the page being viewed such as the category of the page (`Category`), as well as the name of the page (`Sample`) along with the unique user ID.\n\n#### Set custom page event names\n\nYou can set custom event names for your `page` calls.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> This feature is available only in cloud mode.\n\nTo use this feature, enable the **Use Custom Page Event Name** dashboard setting and specify the event name format in the **Page Event Name Format** field.\n\n[![Set custom page event names](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/custom-page-event-name.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/custom-page-event-name.webp)\n\nFor example, if you set the event name format as `Viewed a {{ name }}` and pass the following event:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.page(\"Home\")\n```\n\nIn this case, RudderStack sets the event name as `Viewed a Home` before sending it to Amplitude.\n\n## Screen\n\nThe `screen` method allows you to record whenever a user sees the mobile screen, along with any associated optional properties. This call is similar to the `page` call, but is exclusive to your mobile device.\n\nA sample `screen` call looks like the following code snippet:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.screen({\n  userId: \"user_id\",\n  category: \"Category\",\n  name: \"Sample\",\n})\n```\n\nIn the above snippet, we capture information related to the screen being viewed, such as screen’s name and category.\n\n#### Set custom screen event names\n\nYou can set custom event names for your `screen` calls.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> This feature is available only in cloud mode.\n\nTo use this feature, enable the **Use Custom Screen Event Name** dashboard setting and specify the event name format in the **Screen Event Name Format** field.\n\n[![Set custom screen event names](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/amplitude-screen-settings.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/amplitude-screen-settings.webp)\n\nFor example, if you set the event name format as `Viewed a {{ name }}` and pass the following event:\n\n```\n[[RSClient sharedInstance] screen:@\"Main\"\n                properties:@{\n                  @\"title\" : \"Home | RudderStack\",\n                  @\"url\" : @\"http://www.rudderstack.com\"}\n                ];\n```\n\nIn this case, RudderStack sets the event name as `Viewed a Main` before sending it to Amplitude.\n\n## Group\n\nThe `group` call lets you associate a particular identified user with a group, such as a company, organization, or an account.\n\nRudderStack supports sending `group` calls in cloud mode. When sending events via device mode, `group` is supported only by the web (JavaScript) SDK.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> [Groups](https://developers.amplitude.com/docs/group-identify-api) are an enterprise-only feature in Amplitude and you need to purchase the [Accounts](https://help.amplitude.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001765532) addon to use them.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> This feature is only available for cloud and web (JavaScript) device mode.\n\nTo use the Amplitude Groups feature with RudderStack, you need to define the `Group name trait` and `Group value trait` in the dashboard settings. To send the events, see below:\n\n*   **Cloud mode**: Pass the above fields as traits while making a `group` call.\n*   **Device mode**: RudderStack triggers a `group` call even for a `groupId` by mentioning `groupType` as `'[RudderStack] Group'` and `value` as `groupId`.\n\nEven if you don’t have an enterprise account or the Groups add-on, RudderStack adds `groups` as a user property in the user’s profile with **Group Name Trait** as its type and **Group Value Trait** as its value.\n\nSuppose you have defined the **Group Name Trait** as `RS` and **Group Value Trait** as `RudderStack` and made the `group` call. The user would then be associated with the Group name: `RS` and the Group Value: `RudderStack`.\n\nRudderStack does not support associating a user to more than one group per `group` call sent to Amplitude. To send more than one group per user, you must call the `group` API multiple times with the relevant group information specified in the [group settings](#identify--group-settings).\n\n## Track\n\nThe `track` call lets you record the user’s actions along with any properties associated with them.\n\nA sample `track` call looks like the following:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"Track me\")\n```\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> **Applicable for mobile only**: If you set a property with the name `optOutOfSession` and value `true` then this `track` call will be opted out of the current session if it exists or does not start a new session if there isn’t any active session.\n\n#### Revenue events\n\nRevenue events are available in **web device mode only**. To track revenue events, we use Amplitude’s `logRevenueV2()` API which expects `revenue` as a top level attribute.\n\nTo track a revenue event, you must include a `revenue` key in the event, like so:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"Item Purchased\", {\n  revenue: 30,\n  revenue_type: \"add-on purchase\",\n})\n```\n\nIf you send a `price` and `quantity` with the revenue key, the revenue will be calculated in Amplitude as `price * quantity`\n\nYou may also set a `product_id`, but only if `revenue` has been set.\n\nIf a `products` array is present in the event payload, then to track products individually at each product level, `price` or `revenue` must be present or revenue will not be tracked, as `logRevenueV2` uses both `price` and `quantity` to calculate `revenue`.\n\nIf no `quantity` is present, we will assume a quantity of `1` as default as `1`.\n\n#### Order Completed\n\nA sample `Order Completed` ecommerce event looks like this:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"Order Completed\", {\n  checkoutId: \"ABCD1234\",\n  orderId: \"order1234\",\n  revenue: 50,\n  products: [\n    {\n      productId: \"product1\",\n      sku: \"45790-32\",\n      name: \"Monopoly: 3rd Edition\",\n      price: 20,\n      quantity: 1,\n      category: \"Games\",\n    },\n    {\n      productId: \"product2\",\n      sku: \"46493-32\",\n      name: \"Uno Card Game\",\n      price: 15,\n      quantity: 2,\n      category: \"Games\",\n    },\n  ],\n})\n```\n\nThe above call will generate one `Order Completed` event, 2 individual `Product purchased` events and 2 revenue events (one with `$price` as `15` and `$quantity` as `2` and the other one with `$price` as `20` and `$quantity` as `1` ) at Amplitude, provided that in the destination settings dashboard: `Track revenue per product settings` is enabled. The two separate revenue events are generated for device mode. For cloud mode, revenue will be tracked along with the 2 `Product purchased` events.\n\n#### Multi-product purchases\n\nAmplitude allows you to define how you want to track multi-product purchases. This feature is available in **web device mode only**.\n\nIf you enable “Track revenue per product” in your ecommerce settings, you will then be able to track each product’s revenue as a separate event. Otherwise, the event will be sent as an aggregate revenue of all products.\n\nIf you enable “Track products once”, then an array of products will be tracked as a single event. The event would be passed as the original event name, with all products as properties.\n\n## Alias\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> This feature is currently only available when sending events through the JavaScript SDK in cloud mode.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> To use Alias, you must enable the Amplitude Portfolio add-on.\n\nRefer to the [JavaScript SDK documentation](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/supported-api/#alias) for information and examples on how to call the `alias` event.\n\n#### Mapping\n\nAmplitude’s `alias` call simply creates a mapping or link between the `user_id` specified in the `from` parameter to the `global_user_id` specified in the `to` parameter of the `alias` call.\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.alias(\"user_id\", \"global_user_id\", options, callback)\n```\n\n#### Unmapping\n\nWith Amplitude, it is possible to **unmap** an already established link, or `alias`. In order to trigger Amplitude to unmap a connection, follow the code snippet template below.\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.alias(\"user_id_to_unmapped\", {\n  integrations: {\n    Amplitude: {\n      unmap: true,\n    },\n  },\n})\n```\n\nIn the snippet above, `user_to_be_unmapped`, will be unmapped or unlinked from the `global_user_id` it is currently linked to.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> For the unmapping call, it is not necessary to provide `global_user_id` in the `to` parameter of the `alias` call. If it is included, RudderStack will dismiss this field.\n\nFor more information on how the `alias` call works for Amplitude, refer to this [Amplitude support page](https://help.amplitude.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002750712-Portfolio-Cross-Project-Analysis#h_76557c8b-54cd-4e28-8c82-2f6778f65cd4).\n\n## Advanced Features\n\n#### Reset\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> This feature is currently available as a part of RudderStack Mobile SDKs only.\n\nThe `reset` method resets the previously identified user and related information.\n\n```\n[[RSClient sharedInstance] reset];\n```\n\n#### Sending `event_id`\n\nRudderStack supports sending `event_id` to Amplitude in device mode. You can include it under the `integrations` object and it is supported for all above-mentioned API calls, namely, `identify`, `track`, `page`, `screen`, and `group`.\n\nA sample `identify` call with `event_id` is as follows:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify(\n  \"1hKOmRA4el9Zt1WSfVJIVo4GRlm\", {\n    name: \"Alex Keener\"\n  }, {\n    integrations: {\n      Amplitude: {\n        event_id: 1234\n      }\n    }\n  }\n);\n```\n\n#### Skip user properties sync\n\nWhen you send an event to Amplitude via RudderStack, Amplitude updates the existing user properties and appends any new ones. However, you can change this behavior by sending the `skip_user_properties_sync` property as `true` in the `integrations` object:\n\n```\n\"integrations\": {\n        ...\n        ...\n        \"Amplitude\": {\n            \"skipUserPropertiesSync\": true\n        }\n        ...\n        ...\n    }\n```\n\nThis ensures that the event in Amplitude includes only the user properties sent with it, does not modify the user properties table, and does not include any pre-existing user properties. See [Amplitude documentation](https://www.docs.developers.amplitude.com/analytics/data-backfill-guide/#skip-user-properties-sync) for more information.\n\n#### Deleting a user\n\nYou can delete a user in Amplitude using [Suppression with Delete regulation](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/api/user-suppression-api/#adding-a-suppression-with-delete-regulation) in the RudderStack [User Suppression API](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/api/user-suppression-api/).\n\nTo delete a user, you must specify their `userId` in the event. Optionally, you can specify a custom identifier.\n\nA sample regulation request body for deleting a user in Amplitude is shown below:\n\n```\n{\n  \"regulationType\": \"suppress_with_delete\",\n  \"destinationIds\": [\n    \"2FIKkByqn37FhzczP23eZmURciA\"\n  ],\n  \"users\": [{\n    \"userId\": \"1hKOmRA4GRlm\",\n    \"<customKey>\": \"<customValue>\"\n  }]\n}\n```\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### Why are all my session IDs `-1` in Amplitude?\n\nYou will see the session IDs as `-1` in Amplitude if you are sending events in [cloud mode](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#cloud-mode) and:\n\n*   You are not including the session ID in your event’s `context.sessionId`.\n*   If the `sessionId` is not an integer (ideally, a Unix timestamp)\n\nSee [Amplitude’s documentation](https://help.amplitude.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002323627-Track-sessions#h_a832c1ce-717a-4ab3-b205-9d7ed418ef1a) for more information on how Amplitude tracks user sessions.\n\n#### Can I send more than one group per user to Amplitude?\n\nRudderStack does not support associating a user to more than one group per `group` API call sent to Amplitude. To send more than one group per user, you need to call the `group` API multiple times with the relevant group information specified in the [group settings](#identify--group-settings).\n\n#### How does RudderStack send the operating system information to Amplitude?\n\nRudderStack sends the following [contextual fields](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/common-fields/#contextual-fields) that capture the operating system details:\n\n| RudderStack field | Amplitude property | Data type | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `os.name` | [`os_name`](https://www.docs.developers.amplitude.com/analytics/apis/http-v2-api/#keys-for-the-event-argument:~:text=of%20the%20device.-,os_name,-Optional.%20String.%20The) | String | *   **Web SDK**: Browser name (Example: `Chrome`)<br>*   **Mobile SDKs**: Mobile operating system (Example: `iOS`) |\n| `os.version` | [`os_version`](https://www.docs.developers.amplitude.com/analytics/apis/http-v2-api/#keys-for-the-event-argument:~:text=user%20is%20using.-,os_version,-Optional.%20String.%20The) | String | *   **Web SDK**: Browser version<br>*   **Mobile SDKs**: OS version |\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> *   To send the OS-related information differently, you can write a [transformation](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/transformations/create/#adding-a-transformation) according to your requirements.\n>     \n> *   Amplitude combines the above fields to set the [`OS` property](https://help.amplitude.com/hc/en-us/articles/215562387-User-property-definitions#:~:text=Android%22%2C%20or%20%22Web%22-,OS,-character%20varying%20) as:\n>     \n>     `OS` = `os_name` + `os_version`\n>     \n>     For example, `iOS 9.1`, `Chrome 45`.\n>     \n\n#### Why am I getting 429 errors in Amplitude?\n\nYou might be sending too many requests at a time for a given user. Amplitude has a limit of 10 events per second per user. It is recommended to stop sending events for some time (at least 30 seconds) before retrying.\n\nFor more information on the common API error codes, see this [Amplitude support page](https://community.amplitude.com/data-instrumentation-57/common-api-error-codes-215).\n\nQuestions?

    "markdown": "# ClickUp destination | RudderStack Docs\n\nSend your event data from RudderStack to ClickUp.\n\n* * *\n\n*     6 minute read  \n    \n\n[ClickUp](https://clickup.com/) is a productivity tool that lets you set up project workflows and tasks, and enable smooth cross-team collaboration.\n\nRudderStack supports ClickUp as a destination where you can seamlessly send your event data.\n\n## Getting started\n\nBefore configuring ClickUp as a destination in RudderStack, verify if the source platform is supported by ClickUp by referring to the table below:\n\n| Connection Mode | Web | Mobile | Server |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Device mode | \\-  | \\-  | \\-  |\n| Cloud mode | Supported | Supported | Supported |\n\nOnce you have confirmed that the source platform supports sending events to ClickUp, follow these steps:\n\n1.  From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add a source. Then, from the list of destinations, select **ClickUp**.\n2.  Assign a name to the destination and click **Continue**.\n\n## Connection settings\n\nTo successfully configure ClickUp as a destination, you will need to configure the following settings:\n\n[![ClickUp connection settings](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/clickup-connection-settings-1.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/clickup-connection-settings-1.webp)\n\n*   **API Token**: Enter your ClickUp API token.\n*   **List ID**: Enter your ClickUp list ID.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> For more information on obtaining your ClickUp API token and list ID, refer to the [FAQ](#faq) section below.\n\n*   **Mapping to add custom fields while creating a task**: Use this setting to map a specific RudderStack event property to a ClickUp Custom Field.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> For more information on using this setting, refer to the [Adding custom fields](#adding-custom-fields) section below.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> You can provide multiple ClickUp custom fields associated with different lists. However, note that the custom field name **must be unique** within a list to successfully create a task.\n\n*   **Client-side Events Filtering**: This setting lets you specify which events should be allowed to flow through to ClickUp.\n\n[![ClickUp connection settings](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/clickup-connection-settings-2.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/clickup-connection-settings-2.webp)\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack will discard the events **not included** in the allowlist.\n\n## Track\n\nYou can use the [`track`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/track/) calls to create a task in ClickUp.\n\nA sample `track` call is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\n  \"Product Viewed\", {\n    \"taskName\": \"Whole Foods Market\",\n    \"tags\": [\"plan\", \"proposal\", \"marketing\"],\n    \"timeEstimate\": 10800000,\n    \"status\": \"Proposal\",\n    \"dueDate\": \"2023-02-25T13:39:21.032Z\",\n    \"startDate\": \"2022-01-20T13:39:21.032Z\",\n    \"industryKey\": \"Retail\",\n    \"paymentStatus\": \"Reject\",\n    \"label\": [\"Transformer\", \"QA\", \"Testing\"],\n    \"location\": {\n      \"lat\": -28.016667,\n      \"lng\": 124,\n      \"formattedAddress\": \"New Orleans, Louisiana\",\n    },\n    \"phone\": \"+12025550146\",\n  }, {\n    \"externalId\": [{\n        \"type\": \"clickUpListId\",\n        \"id\": \"199314977\",\n      },\n      {\n        \"type\": \"clickUpAssigneeId\",\n        \"id\": 61205104,\n      },\n      {\n        \"type\": \"clickUpAssigneeId\",\n        \"id\": 61229682,\n      },\n    ],\n  }\n);\n```\n\nRudderStack uses the ClickUp [`task`](https://clickup.com/api/clickupreference/operation/CreateTask/) endpoint to create a task within a list.\n\nTo successfully create a task, you need to specify the [List ID](#where-can-i-find-the-clickup-list-id) in the dashboard settings. You can also pass the list ID through `externalId`, as seen in the above sample snippet.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack gives preference to the list ID passed via `externalId` over the list ID specified in the dashboard.\n\n### Adding assignees to a task\n\nWhile creating a task, you can assign it to a Team(Workspace) member by specifying a `userId`. You can also pass multiple `userId` in an `externalId` array:\n\n```\n{\n  \"context\": {\n    \"externalId\": [{\n        \"type\": \"clickUpAssigneeId\",\n        \"id\": 1232\n      },\n      {\n        \"type\": \"clickUpAssigneeId\",\n        \"id\": 88765\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Adding custom fields\n\nYou can pass the custom fields to ClickUp by specifying the mapping in the **Mapping to add custom fields while creating a task** dashboard setting:\n\n[![ClickUp custom field dashboard setting](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/clickup-custom-field.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/clickup-custom-field.webp)\n\nYou can specify the **ClickUp Custom Field Name** corresponding to the [custom field you created in the ClickUp dashboard](#how-can-i-create-custom-fields-in-clickup) and the **RudderStack Payload Property** corresponding to the event property present in the payload.\n\nRudderStack uses the custom field name to retrieve the `id` using the [`field`](https://clickup.com/api/clickupreference/operation/GetAccessibleCustomFields/) endpoint.\n\n### Supported custom fields\n\nRudderStack supports specifying the following ClickUp custom fields in the dashboard settings:\n\n| Custom Field | Notes |\n| --- | --- |\n| URL | Must be in a valid URL format. |\n| Email | Must be in a valid email format. |\n| Phone | Must be a valid phone number with a country code, for example, `+1 123 456 7890`. |\n| Date | Must be a valid date in a datetime format, for example, `2022-02-25T13:39:21.032Z`. |\n| Text | Must be a string. |\n| Checkbox | Must be in a Boolean format. |\n| Number | \\-  |\n| Currency | Must be a number. |\n| Emoji (integer) | Used for rating. The value must be in a range defined in the ClickUp dashboard. |\n| Location | Latitude/longitude and the formatted address must be passed as the [Google Geocoding API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/overview?hl=en). |\n| Dropdown | RudderStack uses the dropdown option name to find the UUID using the `field` endpoint. |\n| Label | RudderStack will use the label name to find the UUID using the `field` endpoint. |\n\nRudderStack currently **does not support** specifying the following custom fields:\n\n*   Tasks\n*   Users\n*   Automatic Progress\n*   Manual Progress\n\nNote that when sending the custom fields to ClickUp:\n\n*   You can provide multiple custom fields of different ClickUp lists in the dashboard.\n*   To successfully create a task, you need to provide a **unique** custom field name within a list in the custom field mapping.\n\n### Supported mapping\n\nThe following table lists the mappings between the **optional** RudderStack properties and the ClickUp properties:\n\n| RudderStack property | ClickUp property | Data type |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `context.externalId.id`  <br>when `context.externalId.type` = `clickUpListId` | `list_id` | String |\n| `properties.taskName` / `message.event` | `name` | String |\n| `properties.description` | `description` | String |\n| `context.externalId.id`  <br>when `context.externalId.type` = `clickUpAssigneeId` | `assignees` | Array |\n| `properties.tags` | `tags` | Array |\n| `properties.priority` | `priority` | Integer |\n| `properties.timeEstimate` | `time_estimate` | Integer (in ms) |\n| `properties.status` | `status` | String |\n| `properties.dueDate` | `due_date` | Datetime |\n| `properties.includeDueDateTime` | `due_date_time` | Boolean |\n| `properties.startDate` | `start_date` | Datetime |\n| `properties.includeStartDateTime` | `start_date_time` | Boolean |\n| `properties.notifyAll` | `notify_all` | Boolean |\n| `properties`  <br>(Only fields mentioned in the dashboard mapping) | `custom_fields` | Array |\n\n## Rate limits\n\nNote that the ClickUp enforces rate limits per OAuth and personal token.

    "markdown": "# Apache Kafka | RudderStack Docs\n\nSend your event data from RudderStack to Apache Kafka.\n\n* * *\n\n*     7 minute read  \n    \n\n[Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) is a popular distributed streaming platform used for building realtime data pipelines and streaming apps.\n\n## Getting started\n\nRudderStack supports sending events to Apache Kafka via the following [connection modes](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/):\n\n| Connection Mode | Web | Mobile | Server |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Device mode** | \\-  | \\-  | \\-  |\n| **Cloud mode** | **Supported** | **Supported** | **Supported** |\n\nOnce you have confirmed that the source platform supports sending events to Apache Kafka, follow these steps:\n\n1.  From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add the source. Then, from the list of destinations, select **Apache Kafka**.\n2.  Assign a name to your destination and click **Continue**.\n\n### Connection settings\n\nTo successfully set up Apache Kafka as a destination, you need to configure the following settings:\n\n*   **Host Name(s)**: Enter your Kafka server broker’s host name. You can specify multiple host names in a comma-separated format.\n*   **Port**: Enter the port number to connect to the Kafka broker.\n*   **Topic Name**: Specify the default Kafka topic where you want to send the event data.\n*   **SSL Enabled**: Enable this option if you have enabled SSL to connect to your broker.\n    *   **CA Certificate**: If SSL is enabled, enter the CA certificate.\n*   **Enable SASL with SSL**: Enable this setting to use SASL for client authentication.\n    *   **SASL Type**: Choose the SASL authentication type from **Plain**, **SCRAM SHA-512**, and **SCRAM SHA-256**.\n    *   **Username**: Enter the username configured in Kafka for authenticating clients with SASL.\n    *   **Password**: Enter the password for the above username.\n\n*   **Convert Data to AVRO format**: Enable this setting to serialize your data using Avro and send it to the specified Kafka topic.\n    *   **Schema ID**: Enter the schema ID for the schema list.\n    *   **Schema**: Enter the schema corresponding to the above-mentioned ID.\n*   **Enable multiple topic support for event types and event names**: Enable this setting to deliver your events to multiple Kafka topics.\n    *   **Map event type to topic**: You can use this setting to send a particular event type ([`identify`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/identify/), [`group`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/group/), [`page`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/page/), [`screen`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/screen/), [`alias`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/alias/)) to a specific Kafka topic.\n    *   **Map Track events to topic**: You can use this setting to map a particular [`track`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/track/) event to a specific Kafka topic.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> If this setting is disabled, RudderStack sends all events to the Kafka topic specified in the **Topic Name** setting. Also, if you configure only a few event types or specific `track` events with the above setting, RudderStack sends the rest of the events to the topic defined in the **Topic Name** setting.\n\n## Sending events to Kafka topics\n\nYou can send your events to a specific Kafka topic by configuring the [Topic Name](#connection-settings) dashboard setting.\n\nAlternatively, you can send your events to a Kafka topic by specifying the topic name in the `integrations` object:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\n  \"Feedback Submitted\", {\n    feedbackScore: 9,\n    feedbackText: \"Great Product!\",\n    ip: \"127.0.0.0\",\n    url: \"https://www.google.com/\",\n    createdAt: \"2022-01-20T13:39:21.032Z\"\n  }, {\n    integrations: {\n      \"All\": true,\n      \"Kafka\": {\n        \"topic\": \"myTopic\",\n      },\n    },\n  }\n);\n```\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> The mappings specified in the `integrations` object take precedence over the dashboard settings.\n\nRudderStack also supports sending events to multiple Kafka topics. To do so, enable the **Enable multiple topic support for event types and event names** dashboard setting and configure the mappings:\n\n[![Kafka connection settings](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/kafka-event-mapping-settings.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/kafka-event-mapping-settings.webp)\n\n## Serializing data using Avro\n\nRudderStack lets you serialize your data using [Avro](https://www.ibm.com/in-en/topics/avro) and send it to a specific Kafka topic by leveraging the [goavro](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/linkedin/goavro/v2) package.\n\nTo use this feature, you need to pass the `schemaId` in your event’s `integrations` object, as shown in the below event payload:\n\n```\n{\n  \"event\": \"Product Added\",\n  \"messageId\": \"4bb69e26-b5a6-446a-a140-dbb6263369c9\",\n  \"type\": \"track\",\n  \"anonymousId\": \"\",\n  \"context\": {\n    \"traits\": {\n      \"email\": \"alex@example.com\"\n    },\n  },\n  \"integrations\": {\n    \"KAFKA\": {\n      \"schemaId\": \"schema001\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"originalTimestamp\": \"2022-06-22T12:31:19.002+05:30\",\n  \"receivedAt\": \"2022-06-22T12:31:15.656+05:30\",\n  \"request_ip\": \"[::1]\",\n  \"sentAt\": \"2022-06-22T12:31:19.002+05:30\",\n  \"timestamp\": \"2022-06-22T12:31:15.655+05:30\"\n}\n```\n\nThe corresponding schema is shown below:\n\n```\n{\n  \"name\": \"RudderStackEvent\",\n  \"type\": \"record\",\n  \"namespace\": \"com.acme.avro\",\n  \"fields\": [{\n    \"name\": \"anonymousId\",\n    \"type\": \"string\"\n  }, {\n    \"name\": \"event\",\n    \"type\": \"string\"\n  }, {\n    \"name\": \"messageId\",\n    \"type\": \"string\"\n  }, {\n    \"name\": \"originalTimestamp\",\n    \"type\": \"string\"\n  }, {\n    \"name\": \"receivedAt\",\n    \"type\": \"string\"\n  }, {\n    \"name\": \"request_ip\",\n    \"type\": \"string\"\n  }, {\n    \"name\": \"rudderId\",\n    \"type\": \"string\"\n  }, {\n    \"name\": \"sentAt\",\n    \"type\": \"string\"\n  }, {\n    \"name\": \"timestamp\",\n    \"type\": \"string\"\n  }, {\n    \"name\": \"type\",\n    \"type\": \"string\"\n  }, {\n    \"name\": \"context\",\n    \"type\": \"record\",\n    \"fields\": [{\n      \"name\": \"traits\",\n      \"type\": \"record\",\n      \"fields\": [{\n        \"name\": \"email\",\n        \"type\": \"string\"\n      }]\n    }, {\n      \"name\": \"ip\",\n      \"type\": \"string\"\n    }]\n  }, {\n    \"name\": \"integrations\",\n    \"type\": \"record\",\n    \"fields\": [{\n      \"name\": \"KAFKA\",\n      \"type\": \"record\",\n      \"fields\": [{\n        \"name\": \"schemaId\",\n        \"type\": \"string\"\n      }]\n    }]\n  }]\n}\n```\n\n## Partition key\n\nRudderStack uses the `userId` in the event as the partition key of the message.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> If `userId` is not present in payload, then RudderStack uses `anonymousId` instead.\n\nSo, if you have a multi-partitioned topic, then the records of the same `userId` (or `anonymousId` in absence of `userId`) will always go to the same partition.\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### Does my Kafka server require client authentication?\n\nIf you have enabled 2-way SSL, that is, your server requires client authentication, then you need to have the CA certificate and put that in the truststore of your server.\n\n#### How can I enable the 2-way SSL in Kafka and connect to RudderStack?\n\nFollow the below steps to make use of Java’s **keytool** utility to enable two-way SSL in Kafka and connect to RudderStack:\n\n**Step 1: Generate the key and certificate**\n\nRun the following command:\n\n```\nkeytool -keystore kafka.server.keystore.jks -alias localhost -keyalg RSA -genkey\n```\n\n**Step 2: Create your own CA**\n\nFollow these steps to create your own CA:\n\n1.  Generate a CA that is a public-private key pair and a certificate by running the command below. **Enter the contents of this certificate in the RudderStack dashboard under the CA certificate setting**.\n\n```\nopenssl req -new -x509 -keyout ca-key -out ca-cert -days {validity}\n```\n\n2.  Add the generated CA to the **broker’s truststore** so that the brokers can trust this CA.\n    \n    ```\n    keytool -keystore kafka.server.truststore.jks -alias CARoot -importcert -file ca-cert\n    ```\n    \n\n**Step 3: Sign the certificate**\n\nFollow the steps below:\n\n1.  Export the certificate from the keystore:\n\n```\nkeytool -keystore kafka.server.keystore.jks -alias localhost -certreq -file cert-file\n```\n\n2.  Sign it with the CA:\n\n```\nopenssl x509 -req -CA ca-cert -CAkey ca-key -in cert-file -out cert-signed -days {validity} -CAcreateserial -passin pass:{ca-password}\n```\n\n3.

It is recommended to use SSL for that.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> You should allow **only the authenticated clients** to this exposed address.\n\nIf you use `PLAINTEXT` for your internal services within your cluster, you might already have the address. Open this address with SSL. You need to update `advertised.listeners` in your `server.properties`, as shown in the below example:\n\n```\n# Hostname and port the broker will advertise to producers and consumers.\n# here the INTERNAL listener is your cluster kafka service host for kafka server\n# and the EXTERNAL listener is the public loadbalancer for kafka server\nadvertised.listeners=INTERNAL://kafka-0.kafka-headless.kafka-test-1.svc.cluster.local:9092,EXTERNAL://ab7e36e84991c11ea8a930ebf847c1ef-555780507.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com:19092\nlistener.security.protocol.map=INTERNAL:PLAINTEXT,EXTERNAL:SSL\n```\n\n#### Does RudderStack support `SASL_PLAINTEXT` authentication?\n\nRudderStack does not support `SASL_PLAINTEXT` authentication. You can use `SASL_SSL` instead. The [official Kafka documentation](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#security_sasl) recommends using SASL with SSL in production.\n\n#### Why is the connection between Kafka and Zookeeper is failing for `SASL`?\n\nYou can try configuring your Zookeeper with `SASL_SSL` to resolve this issue.\n\nQuestions?

    "markdown": "# Confluent Cloud | RudderStack Docs\n\nSend your event data from RudderStack to Confluent Cloud.\n\n* * *\n\n*     2 minute read  \n    \n\n[Confluent Cloud](https://www.confluent.io/confluent-cloud/) is a cloud-native, fully-managed event streaming platform. Powered by Apache Kafka, it is simple, secure, and simplifies data ingestion and processing on all major clouds. With Confluent Cloud, you can easily handle large-scale data workloads without compromising on performance.\n\nRudderStack allows you to seamlessly configure Confluent Cloud as a destination to send your event data.\n\n## Configuring Confluent Cloud in RudderStack\n\nTo enable sending data to Confluent Cloud, you will first need to add it as a destination to the source you are sending your event data. Once the destination is enabled, events from RudderStack will start flowing to Confluent Cloud.\n\nBefore configuring your source and destination on [RudderStack](https://app.rudderstack.com/), check whether Confluent Cloud supports the platform you are working on by referring to the table below:\n\n| **Connection Mode** | **Web** | **Mobile** | **Server** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Device Mode** | \\-  | \\-  | \\-  |\n| **Cloud Mode** | **Supported** | **Supported** | **Supported** |\n\nOnce you have confirmed that the platform supports sending events to Confluent Cloud, perform the steps mentioned below:\n\n*   Choose a source to which you would like to add Confluent Cloud as a destination.\n*   Select the destination as **Confluent Cloud**. Give your destination a name, and then click **Next**.\n*   In the **Connection Settings**, **fill the required fields with the relevant information and click Next.**\n\n[![](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/screenshot-2020-11-27-at-1.28.49-pm.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/screenshot-2020-11-27-at-1.28.49-pm.webp)\n\nConfluent Cloud connection settings\n\nThe required fields are as follows:\n\n*   **Bootstrap server**: Enter your bootstrap server information here. This is in the format `hostname:`:`port` . You will get this information in your cluster settings.\n*   **Topic Name**: Enter the name of the Kafka topic in this field.\n*   **API Key**: This is the key you need to generate in the Confluent Cloud UI to give RudderStack the required API access. Enter the key in this field.\n*   **API Secret**: Enter the API Secret in this field - you can generate this in the Confluent Cloud UI.\n\n## Partition Key\n\nRudderStack uses `userId` as the partition key of a given message.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> If `userId` is not present in the payload, then `anonymousId` is used.\n\nIf you have a multi-partitioned topic, then the records of the same `userId` (or `anonymousId` in the absence of `userId`) will always go to the same partition.\n\nQuestions?

Change the SDK initialization in your `Application` class:\n\n```\nval rudderClient = RudderClient.getInstance(\n            this,\n            WRITE_KEY,\n            RudderConfig.Builder()\n                .withDataPlaneUrl(DATA_PLANE_URL)\n                .withFactories(ComscoreIntegrationFactory.FACTORY)\n                .build()\n        )\n```\n\nTo add comScore to your iOS project:\n\n1.  Add the following line to your CocoaPods `Podfile`:\n\n2.  After adding the dependency, register `RudderComscoreFactory` with your SDK initialization as a `factory` or `RudderConfig`. To do so, import the `RudderComScoreFactory.h` in your `AppDelegate.m` file:\n\n```\n#import \"RudderComscoreFactory.h\"\n```\n\n3.  Change the SDK initialization to:\n\n```\nRSConfigBuilder *builder = [[RSConfigBuilder alloc] init];\n[builder withDataPlaneUrl:DATA_PLANE_URL];\n[configBuilder withFactory:[RudderComscoreFactory instance]];\n[RSClient getInstance:WRITE_KEY config:[builder build]];\n```\n\n## Identify\n\nYou can use the [`identify`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/identify/) call to set the user ID and traits as persistent labels in comScore.\n\nRudderStack maps the `identify` events to comScore’s `addPersistentLabels` API, followed by making a call to comScore’s `notifyHiddenEvent` API.\n\nA sample `identify` call is shown:\n\n```\nRudderClient.getInstance()?.identify(\n            \"1hKOmRA4GRlm\",\n            RudderTraits()\n                .putEmail(\"alex@example.com\")\n                .put(\"trait_key_1\", \"trait_value_1\")\n                .put(\"trait_key_2\", 4567),\n            null\n        )\n```\n\n## Track\n\nYou can use the [`track`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/track/) call to record user actions. RudderStack also sends any associated properties as labels to comScore.\n\nRudderStack maps the `track` events to comScore’s `notifyHiddenEvent` API.\n\nA sample `track` call is shown:\n\n```\nRudderClient.getInstance()?.track(\n            \"Event name\",\n            RudderProperty()\n                .putValue(\"property_track_key_1\", \"property_value_1\")\n                .putValue(\"property_track_key_2\", 987654)\n                .putValue(\"prop3\", \"value3\")\n        )\n```\n\n## Screen\n\nYou can use the [`screen`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/track/) call to record whenever a user views their mobile screen and capture any properties about the viewed screen.\n\nRudderStack maps the `screen` events to comScore’s `notifyViewEvent` API.\n\nA sample `screen` call is shown:\n\n```\nRudderClient.getInstance()?.screen(\n            \"Screen event name\",\n            RudderProperty()\n                .putValue(\"property_screen_key_1\", \"property_value_2\")\n                .putValue(\"property_screen_key_2\", 9876542)\n        )\n```\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> For both `track` and `screen` events, RudderStack maps the event name with comScore’s `name` field. It sends all the other properties to comScore as is, without any modifications.\n\n## Reset\n\nUse the `reset` call to reset `userId` and the associated traits.\n\nA sample `reset` call is shown:\n\n```\nRudderClient.getInstance()?.reset(true)\n```\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### Where can I find the comScore Publisher ID?\n\n1.

Also, RudderStack expects them to be in the above format for mapping them correctly.\n\n### Unsubscribing users\n\nYou can set `identifyOperation` to `unsubscribe` in the `integrations` object to unsubscribe a user:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify(\"jbu3471\", {\n  \"email\": \"alex@example.com\",\n  \"phone\": \"+1-202-555-0146\",\n}, {\n  \"integrations\": {\n    \"attentive_tag\": {\n      \"identifyOperation\": \"unsubscribe\",\n    },\n    \"subscriptions\": [{\n      \"type\": \"MARKETING\",\n      \"channel\": \"TEXT\"\n    }],\n    \"notification\": {\n      \"language\": \"en-US\"\n    }\n  }\n});\n```\n\nRudderStack maps the following traits to the Attentive properties while unsubscribing a user:\n\n| RudderStack trait | Attentive property |\n| --- | --- |\n| `traits.email`/`context.traits.email`/`properties.email`  <br>Required, if `phone` is not provided. | `email` |\n| `traits.phone`/`context.traits.phone`/`properties.phone`  <br>Required, if `email` is not provided. | `phone` |\n| `integrations.attentive_tag.subscriptions` | `subscriptions` |\n| `integrations.attentive_tag.notification` | `notification` |\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> Passing an `email` attribute does not locate or unsubscribe a user from SMS subscription. Similarly, passing the `phone` attribute does not locate or unsubscribe a user from email subscription.\n\nYou can also unsubscribe a user from a channel by specifying it in `subscriptions` within the `integrations` object. The supported values for `subscriptions` are:\n\n```\n\"subscriptions\": [{\n    \"type\": \"MARKETING\" || \"TRANSACTIONAL\" || \"CHECKOUT_ABANDONED\"\n    \"channel\": \"TEXT\" || \"EMAIL\"\n  }]\n```\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> You can also provide the `language` in the `notification` inside the `integrations` object to change the notification language. Currently, RudderStack supports only `en-US` and `fr-CA` as the notification languages, which are case-sensitive.\n\n## Track\n\nThe [`track`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/track/) call lets you capture the user actions along with the associated properties.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack does not trigger an event if the timestamp is older than 12 hours.\n\n### Property mapping\n\nRudderStack maps the following `track` call properties to the Attentive properties:\n\n| RudderStack property | Attentive property |\n| --- | --- |\n| `event`  <br>Required | `type` |\n| `traits.email`/`context.traits.email`/`properties.email` | `user.email` |\n| `traits.phone`/`context.traits.phone`/`properties.phone` | `user.phone` |\n| `externalId` | `user.externalIdentifiers` |\n| `properties` | `properties` |\n| `originalTimestamp`/`timestamp` | `occuredAt` |\n| `properties.eventId` | `externalEventId` |\n| `context.traits.customIdentifiers`/`traits.customIdentifiers` | `user.externalIdentifiers.customIdentifiers` |\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> Note that:\n> \n> *   You must specify the timestamp in the ISO 8601 format.\n> *   The event type is case-sensitive. For example, Attentive considers `Order shipped` and `Order Shipped` as different events.\n> *   The keys of the `properties` object should not contain characters, like \\[`'`, `\"`, `{`, `}`, `[`, `]`, \\\\ , `,`\\]\n\n### Ecommerce events\n\nRudderStack converts the following ecommerce events to the corresponding Attentive events:\n\n| RudderStack event | Attentive event |\n| --- | --- |\n| Product List Viewed  <br>Product Viewed | `product-view` |\n| Product Added | `add-to-cart` |\n| Order Completed | `purchase` |\n\n#### Product List Viewed\n\nRudderStack maps the `Product List Viewed` event properties to the following Attentive properties:\n\n| RudderStack property | Attentive Tag property |\n| --- | --- |\n| `properties.products.$.product_id`  <br>Required | `items.productId` |\n| `properties.products.$.price`  <br>Required | `items.price.$.value` |\n| `properties.products.$.variant`  <br>Required | `items.productVariantId` |\n| `traits.email`/`context.traits.email`/`properties.email` | `user.email` |\n| `traits.phone`/`context.traits.phone`/`properties.phone` | `user.phone` |\n| `externalId` | `user.externalIdentifiers` |\n| `properties.products.$.currency` | `items.price.$.currency` |\n| `properties.products.$.name` | `items.name` |\n| `properties.products.$.url` | `items.productUrl` |\n| `properties.products.$.image_url` | `items.productImage` |\n| `context.traits.customIdentifiers`/`traits.customIdentifiers` | `user.externalIdentifiers.customIdentifiers` |\n\n#### Product Viewed/Product Added\n\nRudderStack maps the `Product Viewed` and `Product Added` event properties to the following Attentive properties:\n\n| RudderStack property | Attentive property |\n| --- | --- |\n| `properties.product_id`  <br>Required | `items.productId` |\n| `properties.price`  <br>Required | `items.price.$.value` |\n| `properties.variant`  <br>Required | `items.productVariant.Id` |\n| `properties.currency` | `items.price.$.currency` |\n| `properties.name` | `items.name` |\n| `properties.url` | `items.productUrl` |\n| `properties.image_url` | `items.productImage` |\n| `traits.email`/`context.traits.email`/`properties.email` | `user.email` |\n| `traits.phone`/`context.traits.phone`/`properties.phone` | `user.phone` |\n| `externalId` | `user.externalIdentifiers` |\n| `context.traits.customIdentifiers`/`traits.customIdentifiers` | `user.externalIdentifiers.customIdentifiers` |\n\n#### Order Completed\n\nRudderStack maps the `Order Completed` event properties to the following Attentive properties:\n\n| RudderStack property | Attentive property |\n| --- | --- |\n| `properties.products.$.variant`  <br>Required | `items.productVariantId` |\n| `properties.products.$.product_id`  <br>Required | `items.productId` |\n| `properties.products.$.price`  <br>Required | `items.price.$.value` |\n| `properties.products.$.currency` | `items.price.$.currency` |\n| `properties.products.$.name` | `items.name` |\n| `properties.products.$.url` | `items.productUrl` |\n| `properties.products.$.image_url` | `items.productImage` |\n| `traits.email`/`context.traits.email`/`properties.email` | `user.email` |\n| `traits.phone`/`context.traits.phone`/`properties.phone` | `user.phone` |\n| `externalId` | `user.externalIdentifiers` |\n| `context.traits.customIdentifiers`/`traits.customIdentifiers` | `user.externalIdentifiers.customIdentifiers` |\n\nThe following snippet highlights a sample `track` call for the above ecommerce event parameters:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"Order Completed\", {\n  \"products\": [{\n    \"product_id\": \"507f1f77bcf86cd799439011\",\n    \"name\": \"MOBILE\",\n    \"variant\": \"green\",\n    \"price\": \"19\",\n    \"image_url\": \"image.com\",\n    \"url\": \"url.com\",\n    \"quantity\": \"2\",\n    \"currency\": \"USD\"\n  }]\n}, {\n  \"traits\": {\n    \"email\": \"alex@example.com\",\n    \"phone\": \"+1-202-555-0146\"\n  },\n  \"externalId\": [{\n      \"type\": \"clientUserId\",\n      \"id\": \"144\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"shopifyId\",\n      \"id\": \"224\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"klaviyoId\",\n      \"id\": \"132\"\n    }\n  ]\n});\n```\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### Where can I find the Attentive Tag API Key?\n\n1.

    "markdown": "# AppsFlyer Destination | RudderStack Docs\n\nSend your event data from RudderStack to AppsFlyer.\n\n* * *\n\n*     16 minute read  \n    \n\n[AppsFlyer](https://www.appsflyer.com/) is a mobile attribution and marketing analytics platform. It offers intuitive dashboards, real-time data reports, and a unique deep linking technology to understand your customers better.\n\nFind the open source code for this destination in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-transformer/tree/master/src/v0/destinations/af).\n\n## Getting started\n\nRudderStack supports sending events to AppsFlyer via the following [connection modes](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/):\n\n| **Connection Mode** | **Web** | **Mobile** | **Server** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Device mode** | \\-  | **Supported** | \\-  |\n| **Cloud mode** | **Supported** | **Supported** | **Supported** |\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> It is highly recommended to use cloud mode to send events to AppsFlyer in the following scenarios:\n> \n> *   If you want to use RudderStack’s [Transformations](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/transformations/overview/) feature.\n> *   If you want to send server-side events.\n\nOnce you have confirmed that the source platform supports sending events to AppsFlyer, follow these steps:\n\n1.  From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add a source. Then, from the list of destinations, select **AppsFlyer**.\n2.  Assign a name to the destination and click **Continue**.\n\n### Connection settings\n\nThe following connection settings are required to configure AppsFlyer as a destination in RudderStack:\n\n*   **Authorization Type**: Select the authorization type from the dropdown:\n    \n    *   **Authorization with dev key**: In the **AppsFlyer Dev Key** field, enter the [AppsFlyer dev key](#faq).\n    *   **Authorization with server to server key**: In the **AppsFlyer server to server Key** field, enter the [server to server token](https://support.appsflyer.com/hc/en-us/articles/360004562377-Managing-API-and-Server-to-server-S2S-tokens#manage-your-tokens).\n*   **App ID**: Enter your Apple or Android app ID.\n    \n    *   **Android App ID**: This the application ID used in your `app/build.gradle` file.\n    *   **Apple App ID**: This is the iTunes Application ID and it is mandatory for the iOS applications.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> To connect a source other than Android or Apple (iOS, watchOS, iPadOS, tvOS), you need to add a user transformation that adds the OS information required in the events. Refer to the [Connecting AppsFlyer to non-Android/iOS sources](#connecting-appsflyer-to-non-androidios-sources) section below for more information.\n\n*   **Use Rich Event Names**: Enable this setting to include your app’s screen or page name in the [`screen`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/screen/) or [`page`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/page/) event names.\n    \n*   **Add properties at root in eventValue**: Enable this setting to include the custom properties at the root level of `eventValue` field. Otherwise, RudderStack sends them in the `properties` field inside `eventValue`.\n    \n*   **Sharing Filter**: By default, the value for this setting is set to `all`. You can use this setting to meet any regulatory requirements like GDPR and CCPA, complying with user opt-out mechanisms, and for any other business use-case.

For more information on obtaining your API token, refer to this [AppsFlyer guide](https://support.appsflyer.com/hc/en-us/articles/360004562377-Managing-API-tokens).\n    \n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> For user deletion, you must specify both **Status Callback URLs** and **API Token**.\n\n*   **Use device-mode to send events**: Enable this setting to send events from the Android/iOS SDK to Appsflyer via [device mode](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#device-mode).\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Starting from version 2.3.0 of AppsFlyer Android and iOS device mode, RudderStack supports sending all the custom properties of `track` events, along with the standard properties.\n\n## Adding device mode integration\n\nOnce you add AppsFlyer as a destination in the [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), follow these steps to add it to your project depending on your integration platform:\n\nTo add AppsFlyer to your iOS project:\n\n1.  Add the following line to your [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) `Podfile`:\n\n  \n\n2.  After adding the dependency, you need to register `RudderAppsflyerFactory` with your `RudderClient` initialization as a `factory` of `RudderConfig`. To do so, import the `RudderAppsflyerFactory.h` file in your `AppDelegate.m` file:\n\n```\n#import \"RudderAppsflyerFactory.h\"\n```\n\n  \n\n3.  Starting from AppsFlyer iOS device mode version `2.0.0` and above, the RudderStack SDK **does not** automatically initialize the AppsFlyer SDK. You need to initialize the AppsFlyer SDK as shown:\n\n```\n#import <AppsFlyerLib/AppsFlyerLib.h>\n\n[[AppsFlyerLib shared] setAppsFlyerDevKey:<devkey>];\n[[AppsFlyerLib shared] setAppleAppID:<appleappid>];\n[AppsFlyerLib shared].isDebug = YES;\n[[AppsFlyerLib shared] start];\n```\n\n  \n\n4.  Change the iOS SDK initialization to the following:\n\n```\nRSConfigBuilder *builder = [[RSConfigBuilder alloc] init];\n[builder withDataPlaneUrl:DATA_PLANE_URL];\n[builder withTrackLifecycleEvens:YES];\n[builder withRecordScreenViews:YES];\n[builder withFactory:[RudderAppsflyerFactory instance]];\n[builder withLoglevel:RSLogLevelDebug];\n[RSClient getInstance:WRITE_KEY config:[builder build]];\n```\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> This device mode integration is supported for AppsFlyer v6.5.4 and above.\n\nFollow these steps to add AppsFlyer to your iOS project:\n\n1.  Install `RudderAppsFlyer` (available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/)) by adding the following line to your `Podfile`:\n\n```\npod 'RudderAppsFlyer', '~> 1.0.0'\n```\n\n  \n\n2.  Run the `pod install` command.\n    \n3.  Import the SDK depending on your preferred platform:\n    \n\n  \n\n4.  Add the imports to your `AppDelegate` file under the `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` method.\n\n```\nlet config: RSConfig = RSConfig(writeKey: WRITE_KEY)\n            .dataPlaneURL(DATA_PLANE_URL)\n\nRSClient.sharedInstance().configure(with: config)\nclient?.addDestination(RudderAppsFlyerDestination())\n```\n\n  \n\n```\nRSConfig *config = [[RSConfig alloc] initWithWriteKey:WRITE_KEY];\n[config dataPlaneURL:DATA_PLANE_URL];\n\n[[RSClient sharedInstance] configureWith:config];\n[[RSClient sharedInstance] addDestination:[[RudderAppsFlyerDestination alloc] init]];\n```\n\nTo add AppsFlyer to your Android project:\n\n1.  Add the `mavenCentral()` repository:\n\n```\nrepositories {\n    mavenCentral()\n}\n```\n\n2.  Add the following lines to your `app/build.gradle` file under `dependencies`:\n\n```\nimplementation 'com.rudderstack.android.sdk:core:1.+'\nimplementation 'com.rudderstack.android.integration:appsflyer:1.+'\n\nimplementation 'com.appsflyer:af-android-sdk:6.+'\nimplementation 'com.android.installreferrer:installreferrer:2.+'\n```\n\n3.  Starting from AppsFlyer Android device mode version `2.0.0` and above, the RudderStack SDK **does not** automatically initialize the AppsFlyer SDK. Initialize the AppsFlyer SDK as shown:\n\n```\nimport com.appsflyer.AppsFlyerLib;\nimport com.appsflyer.AFLogger;\n\nAppsFlyerLib.getInstance().init(DEV_KEY, null, this);\nAppsFlyerLib.getInstance().setLogLevel(AFLogger.LogLevel.DEBUG);\nAppsFlyerLib.getInstance().start(this);\n```\n\n4.  Change the SDK initialization in your `Application` class:\n\n```\n// initialize Rudder SDK\nval rudderClient: RudderClient =\n    RudderClient.getInstance(\n        this,\n        WRITE_KEY,\n        RudderConfig.Builder()\n            .withDataPlaneUrl(DATA_PLANE_URL)\n            .withFactory(AppsFlyerIntegrationFactory.FACTORY)\n            .build()\n    )\n```\n\nTo add AppsFlyer to your React Native project:\n\n1.  Add the RudderStack-AppsFlyer module to your app using the following command:\n\n```\nnpm install @rudderstack/rudder-integration-appsflyer-react-native\n```\n\nOR\n\n```\nyarn add @rudderstack/rudder-integration-appsflyer-react-native\n```\n\n**For AppsFlyer React Native device mode version less than 1.1.0, follow the below step:**\n\n2.  (a) Import the module and add it to your SDK initialization code:\n\n```\nimport rudderClient from \"@rudderstack/rudder-sdk-react-native\"\nimport appsflyer from \"@rudderstack/rudder-integration-appsflyer-react-native\"\nconst config = {\n  dataPlaneUrl: DATA_PLANE_URL,\n  trackAppLifecycleEvents: true,\n  withFactories: [appsflyer],\n}\nrudderClient.setup(WRITE_KEY, config)\n```\n\n**For AppsFlyer React Native device mode version 1.1.0 or above, follow these steps:**\n\n2.  (b) Initialize the AppsFlyer SDK:\n\n```\nimport rudderClient from \"@rudderstack/rudder-sdk-react-native\";\nimport appsflyer from '@rudderstack/rudder-integration-appsflyer-react-native';\nimport {\n    setOptions\n} from '@rudderstack/rudder-integration-appsflyer-react-native';\n\n// Setting options for initializing the appsflyer sdk\nsetOptions({\n    // dev key from the appsflyer dashboard\n    \"devKey\": \"<dev_key>\",\n    // whether we want to run the appsflyer SDK in the debug mode\n    \"isDebug\": true,\n    // whether we want to register for the listeners which would return the conversion data\n    \"onInstallConversionDataListener\": true,\n    // ID assigned by the Apple app store for any app which is either published or in the process of getting published\n    \"appleAppId\": \"<apple_app_id>\",\n    // whether we want to register for the listeners which would return the deeplink data\n    \"onDeepLinkListener\": true,\n    // the number of seconds for which the appsflyer iOS SDK should wait to allow the app to retrieve the user consent.\n    \"timeToWaitForATTUserAuthorization\": 60\n})\n\n// Configuration object to be passed while initializing the Rudder React Native // SDK\nconst config = {\n    dataPlaneUrl: DATA_PLANE_URL,\n    // Passing appsflyer factory here, since we want to run appsflyer as a device mode destination.\n    withFactories: [appsflyer]\n};\n\n// Finally, initializing the RudderStack React Native SDK\nawait rudderClient.setup( WRITE_KEY , config);\n```\n\nAs seen above, the properties `onInstallConversionDataListener` and `onDeepLinkListener` are set to `true` in the `setOptions` API to get access to the conversion as well as the attribution data.\n\n3.  Register the callbacks with the listeners:\n\n```\nimport {\n    onAppOpenAttribution,\n    onAttributionFailure,\n    onDeepLink,\n    onInstallConversionData,\n    onInstallConversionFailure\n} from '@rudderstack/rudder-integration-appsflyer-react-native';\n\nvar onInstallConversionDataCanceller = onInstallConversionData((data) => {\n    console.log(\"On Install Conversion Success data is \", data);\n    if (JSON.parse(res.data.is_first_launch) == true) {\n        if (res.data.af_status === 'Non-organic') {\n            var media_source = res.data.media_source;\n            var campaign = res.data.campaign;\n            console.log('This is first launch and a Non-Organic install. Media source: ' + media_source + ' Campaign: ' + campaign);\n        } else if (res.data.af_status === 'Organic') {\n            console.log('This is first launch and a Organic Install');\n        }\n    } else {\n        console.log('This is not first launch');\n    }\n\n})\n\nvar onAppOpenAttributionCanceller = onAppOpenAttribution((data) => {\n    console.log(\"On App Open Attribution Success and the data is \", data);\n    // write your own custom logic here\n})\n\nvar onAttributionFailureCanceller = onAttributionFailure((data) => {\n    console.log(\"On App Attribution Failure and the data is \", data);\n    // write your own custom logic here\n})\n\nvar onInstallConversionFailureCanceller = onInstallConversionFailure((data) => {\n    console.log(\"On Install Conversion Failure data is \", data);\n    // write your own custom logic here\n})\n\nvar onDeepLinkCanceller = onDeepLink((data) => {\n    console.log(\"On Deeplink data is \", data);\n    // write your own custom logic here\n})\n```\n\n  \n\n4.  Depending on the React Native components you are using, you can trigger an appropriate method, for example:\n\nIf it’s a class-based component, trigger the `remove()` method in `componentWillUnMount()`:\n\n```\nimport React, {\n    Component\n} from 'react';\nimport {\n    AppState,\n    Platform,\n    StyleSheet,\n    Text,\n    View,\n    Button\n} from 'react-native';\nimport appsFlyer from 'react-native-appsflyer';\n\nconst options = {\n    devKey: \"********\",\n    isDebug: true,\n    onInstallConversionData: true\n};\n\nif (Platform.OS === 'ios') {\n    options.appId = \"123456789\";\n}\nthis.onInstallConversionDataCanceller = appsFlyer.onInstallConversionData(\n    data => {\n        console.log(\"GCD\");\n        console.log(data);\n\n    }\n);\n\nthis.onAppOpenAttributionCanceller = appsFlyer.onAppOpenAttribution(\n    data => {\n        console.log(\"OAOA\");\n        console.log(data);\n    }\n);\nappsFlyer.initSdk(options, (result) => {\n    console.log(result);\n}, (error) => {\n    console.error(error);\n});\ntype Props = {};\nexport default class App extends Component  {\n\n        componentWillUnmount() {\n            if (onInstallConversionDataCanceller) {\n                onInstallConversionDataCanceller();\n                console.log('unregister onInstallConversionDataCanceller');\n                onInstallConversionDataCanceller = null;\n            }\n            if (onAppOpenAttributionCanceller) {\n                onAppOpenAttributionCanceller();\n                console.log('unregister onAppOpenAttributionCanceller');\n                onAppOpenAttributionCanceller = null;\n            }\n```\n\nIf it's a functional component, trigger the \\`useEffect()\\` hook:\n\n```\nimport React, {useEffect, useState} from 'react';\nimport {AppState, SafeAreaView, Text, View} from 'react-native';\nimport appsFlyer from 'react-native-appsflyer';\n\nvar onInstallConversionDataCanceller = appsFlyer.onInstallConversionData(\n    (res) => {\n        if (JSON.parse(res.data.is_first_launch) == true) {\n            if (res.data.af_status === 'Non-organic') {\n                var media_source = res.data.media_source;\n                var campaign = res.data.campaign;\n                console.log('This is first launch and a Non-Organic install. Media source: ' + media_source + ' Campaign: ' + campaign);\n            } else if (res.data.af_status === 'Organic') {\n                console.log('This is first launch and a Organic Install');\n            }\n        } else {\n            console.log('This is not first launch');\n        }\n    },\n);\n\nvar onAppOpenAttributionCanceller = appsFlyer.onAppOpenAttribution((res) => {\n    console.log(res);\n});\n\n\nappsFlyer.initSdk(\n    {\n        devKey: 'K2a*********99',\n        isDebug: false,\n        appId: '41******5',\n    },\n    (result) => {\n        console.log(result);\n    },\n    (error) => {\n        console.error(error);\n    },\n);\n\nconst Home = (props) => {\n\n    useEffect(() => {\n        return () => {\n            // Optionaly remove listeners for deep link data if you no longer need them after componentWillUnmount\n            if (onInstallConversionDataCanceller) {\n              onInstallConversionDataCanceller();\n              console.log('unregister onInstallConversionDataCanceller');\n              onInstallConversionDataCanceller = null;\n            }\n            if (onAppOpenAttributionCanceller) {\n              onAppOpenAttributionCanceller();\n              console.log('unregister onAppOpenAttributionCanceller');\n              onAppOpenAttributionCanceller = null;\n            }\n        };\n    });\n\n    return (\n                {'App'}\n    );\n};\n```\n\n  \n\n5.  Open `AppDelegate.m` in the `ios` folder of your app and include the following snippet:\n\n```\n#import \"RudderIntegrationAppsflyerReactNative.h\"\n\n- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application openURL:(NSURL *)url options:(NSDictionary *) options {\n  [[AppsFlyerAttribution shared] handleOpenUrl:url options:options];\n    return YES;\n}\n\n// Open URI-scheme for iOS 8 and below\n- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application openURL:(NSURL *)url sourceApplication:(NSString*)sourceApplication annotation:(id)annotation {\n  [[AppsFlyerAttribution shared] handleOpenUrl:url sourceApplication:sourceApplication annotation:annotation];\n  return YES;\n}\n\n// Open Universal Links\n- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application continueUserActivity:(NSUserActivity *)userActivity restorationHandler:(void (^)(NSArray * _Nullable))restorationHandler {\n    [[AppsFlyerAttribution shared] continueUserActivity:userActivity restorationHandler:restorationHandler];\n    return YES;\n}\n```\n\n  \n\nTo add AppsFlyer to your Cordova project:\n\n1.  Navigate to the root folder of your application and run the following command:\n\n```\ncordova plugin add rudder-integration-appsflyer-cordova\n```\n\n2.  Add the platforms that you want to target for your app:\n\n```\ncordova platform add ios\ncordova platform add android\n```\n\n3.  Run the following command to build the project for all platforms:\n\n  \n\n4.  Add the following code in the `onDeviceReady()` function of your home page to initialize the SDK:\n\n```\nRudderClient.initialize(WRITE_KEY , {\n  dataPlaneUrl: DATA_PLANE_URL,\n  factories: [RudderAppsflyerFactory]\n})\n```\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Make sure to use the `await` keyword with the `initialize` call.\n\nTo add AppsFlyer to your Flutter project:\n\n1.  Open `pubspec.yaml` and add `rudder_integration_appsflyer_flutter` under the `dependencies` section:\n\n```\ndependencies:\n  rudder_integration_appsflyer_flutter: ^1.1.0\n```\n\n2.  Navigate to your application’s root folder and install all the required dependencies:\n\n3.  Import the module installed above and add it to your SDK initialization code:\n\n```\nimport 'package:rudder_sdk_flutter/RudderController.dart';\nimport 'package:rudder_sdk_flutter_platform_interface/platform.dart';\nimport 'package:rudder_integration_appsflyer_flutter/rudder_integration_appsflyer_flutter.dart';\n\nRudderConfigBuilder builder = RudderConfigBuilder();\nbuilder.withDataPlaneUrl(DATA_PLANE_URL);\nbuilder.withFactory(RudderIntegrationAppsflyerFlutter());\nfinal RudderController rudderClient = RudderController.instance;\nrudderClient.initialize(WRITE_KEY,\n  config: builder.build(), options: null);\n```\n\n4.  Add the following dependency to the `android/app/build.gradle` file of your app:\n\n```\ndependencies {\n  implementation 'com.appsflyer:af-android-sdk:6.+'\n}\n```\n\n5.  Initialize the AppsFlyer Android SDK by overriding the `onCreate` method in `MainActivity.java` file (located in your app’s `android/app/src/main/java/com/your_org/your_app_name/` folder). This ensures that AppsFlyer’s Android SDK is initialized beforehand and is available for the Rudderstack Flutter SDK.\n\n```\nimport com.appsflyer.AppsFlyerLib;\nimport com.appsflyer.AFLogger;\n\n@Override\nprotected void onCreate(@Nullable Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n  super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n  AppsFlyerLib.getInstance().init(\"AF_DEV_KEY\", null, this);\n  AppsFlyerLib.getInstance().setLogLevel(AFLogger.LogLevel.DEBUG);\n  AppsFlyerLib.getInstance().start(this);\n}\n```\n\n6.  Initialize the AppsFlyer iOS SDK by adding the following code at the top of the `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` method in the `AppDelegate.swift` file (located in your app’s `ios/Runner/` folder):\n\n```\nimport AppsFlyerLib\n\nAppsFlyerLib.shared().appsFlyerDevKey = \"AF_DEV_KEY\"\nAppsFlyerLib.shared().appleAppID = \"APPLE_APP_ID\"\nAppsFlyerLib.shared().isDebug = true\nAppsFlyerLib.shared().start()\n```\n\n## Connecting AppsFlyer to non-Android/iOS sources\n\nAppsFlyer supports all RudderStack sources in addition to Android and iOS. However, you need to [add a transformation](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/transformations/create/#adding-a-transformation) to the destination as shown:\n\n```\nexport function transformEvent(event, metadata) {\n  event.context.os = {\n    name: \"android\",\n    version: \"8.1.0\"\n  };\n  return event;\n}\n```\n\nSave the transformation and [connect it to your AppsFlyer destination](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/transformations/manage/#connect-transformation-to-destination) in the RudderStack dashboard.\n\n## Sending events via RudderStack cloud mode\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> It is highly recommended to send events to AppsFlyer via [cloud mode](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#cloud-mode) only in the following scenarios:\n> \n> *   To use RudderStack’s [Transformations](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/transformations/overview/) feature to transform your events\n> *   To send server-side events\n\nTo send events to AppsFlyer via cloud mode, you need the AppsFlyer ID generated by the Appsflyer SDK that is integrated with your app. See [Obtaining the AppsFlyer ID](#obtaining-the-appsflyer-id) for reference.\n\nOnce you obtain the AppsFlyer ID, you can send events to AppsFlyer via cloud mode by including the `externalId` key within your events’ `context`. The format of `externalId` is as shown:\n\n```\n\"externalId\": [\n  {\n    \"id\": \"AppsFlyer_ID\",\n    \"type\": \"appsflyerExternalId\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nThe following table lists the `externalId` fields:\n\n| Field | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `id` | Your AppsFlyer ID. |\n| `type` | The type of `externalId`. This must always be set to `appsFlyerExternalId`. |\n\n### Obtaining the AppsFlyer ID\n\nAs mentioned above, the AppsFlyer ID is generated by the Appsflyer SDK integrated with your app.\n\n*   If the AppsFlyer SDK is directly loaded on your app, refer to this [AppsFlyer documentation](https://support.appsflyer.com/hc/en-us/articles/207034486-Server-to-server-events-API-for-mobile-S2S-mobile-#fetching-the-appsflyer-id) to obtain the AppsFlyer ID.\n*   If your AppsFlyer SDK is loaded through RudderStack (device mode integration), then you can obtain the AppsFlyer ID by including the code snippet in your app, depending on your platform of integration:\n\n```\n#import <appsflyerlib>\nNSString *appsflyerId = [AppsFlyerLib shared].getAppsFlyerUID;\n```\n\n```\nimport com.appsflyer.AppsFlyerLib;\nString appsFlyerId = AppsFlyerLib.getInstance().getAppsFlyerUID(this);\n```\n\n```\nimport { getAppsFlyerId } from \"@rudderstack/rudder-integration-appsflyer-react-native\"\nconst appsFlyerId = await getAppsFlyerId();\n```\n\n## Identify\n\nThe `identify` call sets `userId` through the `setCustomerUserId` method of `AppsFlyerLib`.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack supports the `identify` calls only in the [device mode](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#device-mode).\n\nRudderStack sets `email` from the event traits to AppsFlyer using the native SDK’s `setUserEmails` method:\n\n```\n[[RSClient sharedInstance] identify:@\"developer_user_id\"\n                                 traits:@{@\"email\": @\"bar@foo.com\"}];\n```\n\n### Deleting a user\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> To delete a user in AppsFlyer, you must configure the **Status Callback URLs** and **API Token** settings in the RudderStack dashboard.\n\nYou can delete a user in AppsFlyer using the [Suppression with Delete regulation](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/api/user-suppression-api/#adding-a-suppression-with-delete-regulation) of the RudderStack [User Suppression API](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/api/user-suppression-api/).\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> To delete a user, you must specify their `userId` in the event. Additionally, you can specify any of the following in the event:\n> \n> *   AppsFlyer ID\n> *   [iOS advertising ID/Android advertising ID](#advertising-id) (depending on your platform)\n> *   Any custom identifier like `email`, `phone`, etc.\n\nA sample regulation request body for deleting a user in AppsFlyer is shown below:\n\nSpecify the **App ID** in your [connection settings](#connection-settings).\n\n```\n{\n  \"regulationType\": \"suppress_with_delete\",\n  \"destinationIds\": [\n    \"2FIKkByqn37FhzczP23eZmURciA\"\n  ],\n  \"users\": [{\n    \"userId\": \"1hKOmRA4GRlm\",\n    \"phone\": \"+1-202-555-0146\",\n    \"email\": \"alex@example.com\"\n    \"appsflyerId\": \"asdhw126\"\n  }]\n}\n```\n\nSpecify the **App ID** in your [connection settings](#connection-settings).\n\n```\n{\n  \"regulationType\": \"suppress_with_delete\",\n  \"destinationIds\": [\n    \"2FIKkByqn37FhzczP23eZmURciA\"\n  ],\n  \"users\": [{\n    \"userId\": \"1hKOmRA4GRlm\",\n    \"phone\": \"+1-202-555-0146\",\n    \"email\": \"alex@example.com\"\n    \"ios_advertising_id\": \"asdhw126\"\n  }]\n}\n```\n\nSpecify the **App ID** in your [connection settings](#connection-settings).\n\n```\n{\n  \"regulationType\": \"suppress_with_delete\",\n  \"destinationIds\": [\n    \"2FIKkByqn37FhzczP23eZmURciA\"\n  ],\n  \"users\": [{\n    \"userId\": \"1hKOmRA4GRlm\",\n    \"phone\": \"+1-202-555-0146\",\n    \"email\": \"alex@example.com\"\n    \"android_advertising_id\": \"asdhw126\"\n  }]\n}\n```\n\n## Track\n\nRudderStack’s `track` call is mapped to the standard AppsFlyer events wherever possible.\n\nThe following table lists the event mapping from RudderStack to AppsFlyer:\n\n| **RudderStack event** | **AppsFlyer event** |\n| --- | --- |\n| `Products Searched` | `af_search` |\n| `Product Viewed` | `af_content_view` |\n| `Product List Viewed` | `af_list_view` |\n| `Product Added to Wishlist` | `af_add_to_wishlist` |\n| `Product Added` | `af_add_to_cart` |\n| `Checkout Started` | `af_initiated_checkout` |\n| `Order Completed` | `af_purchase` |\n| `Product Removed` | `remove_from_cart` |\n| `first_purchase` | `first_purchase` |\n| `Promotion Viewed` | `af_ad_view` |\n| `Promotion Clicked` | `af_ad_click` |\n| `Payment Info Entered` | `af_add_payment_info` |\n| `Product Shared` | `af_share` |\n| `Cart Shared` | `af_share` |\n| `Product Reviewed` | `af_rate` |\n\nFor any event not present in the above table, RudderStack makes the following changes to the event name before sending it to AppsFlyer via the native SDK:\n\n*   Converting the entire event name to lower case\n*   Replacing any space with an underscore\n\nAlong with the above event mapping, RudderStack also maps the event properties to the corresponding AppsFlyer event properties, as shown below:\n\n| RudderStack property | AppsFlyer property |\n| --- | --- |\n| `query` | `af_search_string` |\n| `price` | `af_price` |\n| `product_id` | `af_content_id` |\n| `category` | `af_content_type` |\n| `currency` | `eventCurrency` |\n| `products` | RudderStack formulates this list as per the [List View specification](https://support.appsflyer.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005544169#event-structure) and passes it to the property `af_content_list`. |\n| `quantity` | `af_quantity` |\n| `order_id` | `af_receipt_id` |\n| `revenue` | `af_revenue` |\n\nA sample `track` call for an iOS app is shown below:\n\n```\n[[RSClient sharedInstance] track:@\"Accepted Terms of Service\"\n                          properties:@{\n                                  @\"foo\": @\"bar\",\n                              @\"foo_int\": @134\n}];\n```\n\n## Screen\n\nFor all `screen` calls sent from the SDK, RudderStack calls AppsFlyer’s `trackEvent` method with `screen` as the event name. All the event properties are passed to AppsFlyer without any modification.\n\nFor the automatically recorded `screen` calls, RudderStack obtains a Boolean property called `automatic`.\n\n## Advertising ID\n\nRudderStack utilizes the advertising ID for the AppsFlyer destination if it is set as per the following specifications:\n\n*   For iOS: [Advertising ID documentation](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-ios-sdk/#advertisement-id)\n    \n*   For Android: [Advertising ID documentation](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-android-sdk/#advertisement-id)\n    \n\nYou can find the advertising ID in your event’s `context.device.advertisingId`.\n\n## ATTrackingManager\n\nIf the `ATTrackingManager.trackingAuthorizationStatus` is passed according to [ATTrackingManager authorization consent](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-ios-sdk/#attrackingmanager-authorization-consent), RudderStack will utilize it for the AppsFlyer destination.\n\nYou can find `trackingAuthorizationStatus` in your event’s `context.device.attTrackingStatus`.\n\n## Error messages\n\nThis section covers some of the possible error messages you may encounter while using this integration.\n\n### Invalid platform / required androidAppId / appleAppId missing\n\nThis error occurs when either the `OS Name` or your respective App ID is not set.\n\nYou can set the **App ID** in your [settings](#getting-started).\n\nThe SDK automatically sets the `OS Name` and it can be found in `context.os.name`.\n\n### Appsflyer ID is not set. Rejecting the event.\n\nThis error occurs when the `appsflyerExternalId` is not set. Refer to the [Sending events via the RudderStack cloud mode](#sending-events-via-the-rudderstack-cloud-mode) section for more information on setting the `appsflyerExternalId`.\n\n## Debugging\n\nRudderStack sets the `logLevel` in AppsFlyer based on the `logLevel` set for the `RudderClient`. If it is set to `DEBUG` or more, RudderStack sets the `logLevel` to `VERBOSE` for AppsFlyer.\n\nFor anything below that, RudderStack sets the `logLevel` to `NONE` for AppsFlyer.\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### Where do I get the AppsFlyer dev key?\n\nYou can find the **AppsFlyer Dev Key** by logging into your AppsFlyer account and navigating to the **Apps Settings** page in your dashboard. For more information, refer to this [AppsFlyer Help Center](https://support.appsflyer.com/hc/en-us/articles/211719806-App-settings-) page.\n\n#### I get an error saying “Build input file cannot be found” for iOS device mode. What should I do?\n\nThe latest AppsFlyer SDK requires XCode 12. Make sure you meet this requirement. You may have to downgrade your AppsFlyer SDK to build with a lower version of XCode.\n\nYou can declare the `pod` version in your `Podfile` as shown:\n\n```\npod 'Rudder-Appsflyer',' 1.0.0'\n```\n\n#### How do I get the AppsFlyer ID to send events from my mobile sources via the RudderStack cloud mode?\n\nTo send events to AppsFlyer via cloud mode, you first need to obtain the AppsFlyer ID generated by the Appsflyer SDK.\n\nYou can get this ID by either directly loading the native AppsFlyer SDK on your app, or loading it via RudderStack (device mode integration).\n\nIn case of a device mode integration, include the following code snippet (depending on your platform of integration) in your app to get the AppsFlyer ID:\n\n```\n#import <appsflyerlib>\nNSString *appsflyerId = [AppsFlyerLib shared].getAppsFlyerUID;\n```\n\n```\nimport com.appsflyer.AppsFlyerLib;\nString appsFlyerId = AppsFlyerLib.getInstance().getAppsFlyerUID(this);\n```\n\n```\nimport AppsFlyerIntegrationFactory from \"@rudderstack/rudder-integration-appsflyer-react-native/src/bridge\"\nconst appsFlyerId = await AppsFlyerIntegrationFactory.getAppsFlyerId()\n```\n\nyou obtain the AppsFlyer ID, you can send events via cloud mode by by including the `externalId` key within your events’ `context`.

    "markdown": "# Braze Deduplication | RudderStack Docs\n\nAvailable Plans\n\n*   growth\n*   enterprise\n\n* * *\n\n*     6 minute read  \n    \n\nThis guide explains RudderStack’s Braze deduplication feature in detail and how you can use it to save data points and avoid billing overages in Braze.\n\n## Deduplication in Braze\n\nBraze charges its consumption based on [data points](https://www.braze.com/docs/user_guide/data_and_analytics/data_points/#consumption-count) it ingests for every user property and events like session starts and ends, purchases, etc. These data points are accumulated whenever you update a user profile or when the users perform specific actions.\n\nBraze counts all data points irrespective of whether you send any duplicates. It considers every property (except the standard ones) as a data point and counts it against your billing.\n\n> ![success](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/tick.svg)\n> \n> With the deduplication feature, RudderStack prevents duplicate user traits in the `identify` and `track` calls from being sent to Braze, thus saving data points and ultimately avoiding billing overages in Braze.\n> \n> **This feature is particularly useful in Reverse ETL scenarios where a large number of rows are sent with duplicate columns.**\n\n## Get started\n\nTo use the Braze deduplication feature, follow these steps:\n\n1.  Log in to your [Braze dashboard](https://dashboard.braze.com/auth) and go to **Settings** > **Developer Console**.\n2.  Generate a new REST API key with the `users.export.ids` permission. You can find it in the **User Data** section of permissions.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> You also need to include the permissions listed in the Braze destination’s [connection settings](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/braze/#connection-settings).\n\n[![Setting Braze REST API key for dedup](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/braze-dedup-permissions.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/braze-dedup-permissions.webp)\n\n3.  Use this REST API key to set up your Braze destination.\n4.  Toggle on the **Deduplicate Traits (Beta)** option in the Braze [destination configuration settings](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/braze/#deduplication-settings):\n\n[![Enable Braze deduplication setting](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/braze-dedup-enable.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/braze-dedup-enable.webp)\n\n5.  Enable the connection and start sending your events to Braze.\n\n[![Enable Braze deduplication setting](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/braze-enable-connection.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/braze-enable-connection.webp)\n\nTo verify if you are receiving deduplicated traits in Braze, see [FAQ](#verify-deduplication).\n\n## How deduplication works\n\n#### **Device mode**\n\nRudderStack stores the previous `identify` object and uses it for comparison - this check occurs directly in the Braze SDK.\n\n#### **Cloud mode**\n\nRudderStack uses the [`/users/export/ids`](https://www.braze.com/docs/api/endpoints/export/user_data/post_users_identifier/) endpoint (leveraging the **users.export.ids** scope in the [REST API key](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/braze/#connection-settings) used for setting up the Braze destination) to export data from a user profile by specifying a user identifier. It then compares the user profile against the incoming user traits to determine any deltas.\n\nIf a delta is found, RudderStack sends only the updated user traits to Braze and drops the others.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack implements the deduplication logic such that it will not surpass Braze’s API limits in most cases. However, in scenarios where this limit is surpassed, RudderStack defaults to sending **all** events without deduplication until the volume returns below the permissible rate limits.\n\nThe following example highlights how RudderStack sends deduplicated data to Braze:\n\n```\nuser_attributes: {\n  name: \"Alex Keener\",\n  age: 30,\n  location: {\n    city: \"New York\",\n    area: \"Manhattan\",\n    country: \"US\"\n  },\n  interests: [\"hiking\", \"soccer\"]\n}\n```\n\n```\nuser_attributes: {\n  name: \"Alex Keener\",\n  age: 30,\n  location: {\n    city: \"San Francisco\", // delta\n    area: \"California\", // delta\n    country: \"US\" // delta\n  },\n  interests: [\"hiking\", \"soccer\", \"cycling\"] // delta\n}\n```\n\n```\nuser_attributes: {\n  location: {\n    city: \"San Francisco\",\n    area: \"California\",\n    country: \"US\"\n  },\n  interests: [\"hiking\", \"soccer\", \"cycling\"]\n}\n```\n\nNote that RudderStack deduplicates only the billable Braze attributes. It does not deduplicate the following non-billable attributes:\n\n| RudderStack property | Braze data point | Braze data type |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `userId` | User ID | Profile data |\n| `user_alias` | User alias | Profile data |\n| `country` | Country | Profile data |\n| `language` | Language | Profile data |\n| `email_subscribe` | Email subscribed | Contact settings |\n| `push_subscribe` | Push subscribed | Contact settings |\n| `subscription_groups` | Subscription group | Contact settings |\n\nSee [Braze documentation](https://www.braze.com/docs/user_guide/data_and_analytics/data_points/?tab=non-billable#data-points-1) for more information on the billable and non-billable data points.\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### **Which RudderStack Cloud plans support the Braze deduplication feature?**\n\nThe Braze deduplication feature is available in RudderStack Cloud [Growth and Enterprise](https://rudderstack.com/pricing) plans.\n\n#### **How do I verify if deduplicated traits are being sent to Braze?**\n\n1.  Set up your Braze destination in RudderStack by following [these steps](#get-started).\n2.  Create a test `identify` or `track` payload with a new test `userId` in Postman that includes several user traits.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> **You can use the RudderStack HTTP API to send the payloads.**\n> \n> 1.  Import the Postman collection using this [URL](https://www.getpostman.com/collections/480307c55ad2b9dd4e27).\n> 2.  Edit the variable `source_write_key` with the write key of the source connected to your Braze destination.\n> 3.  Edit the variable `data_plane_url` with your [data plane URL](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/dashboard-guides/overview/#connections).\n> 4.  Use **Basic Authentication** for authenticating all HTTP requests.\n> \n> See the [RudderStack HTTP API](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/api/http-api/) documentation for more details.\n\n3.  If you don’t have a test payload, you can use the following snippet:\n\n```\n{\n  \"type\": \"identify\",\n  \"sentAt\": \"2023-04-15T12:07:41.050Z\",\n  \"traits\": {\n    \"first_name\": \"John\",\n    \"last_name\": \"Doe\",\n    \"email\": \"johndoe@example.com\",\n    \"attribute_a\": \"value_a\",\n    \"attribute_b\": \"value_b\",\n    \"myObj\": {\n      \"test\": \"value\"\n    },\n    \"myArr\": [\n      \"value1\",\n      \"value3\"\n    ]\n  },\n  \"userId\": \"john@doe\",\n  \"context\": {\n    \"library\": {\n      \"name\": \"rudder-analytics-php\",\n      \"version\": \"1.0.1\",\n      \"consumer\": \"LibCurl\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"rudderId\": \"86a09397-07e3-4cc4-9bd3-1fa262a5b521\",\n  \"messageId\": \"fb203095-df9d-40bd-bcf3-97eb8084fea4\",\n  \"timestamp\": \"2023-04-15T13:07:39.000+01:00\",\n  \"receivedAt\": \"2023-04-15T12:07:40.222Z\",\n  \"request_ip\": \"212.129.29.104\",\n  \"originalTimestamp\": \"2023-04-15T12:07:41.050Z\"\n}\n```\n\n4.  Go to the Braze destination in your RudderStack dashboard and click the [Live Events](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/dashboard-guides/live-events/#destination-live-events) button. Also, log in to your Braze dashboard.\n\n[![Braze live events button](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/braze-live-events.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/braze-live-events.webp)\n\n5.  Send the test payloads - you should be able to see them in your Live Events viewer. Also, confirm that the attributes show up as expected in your Braze dashboard by going to the **User Search** tab.\n6.  Add or update a few attributes while retaining the rest of the event payload. If you used the event payload in **Step 3**, you can use the following modified payload to test the impact of the attribute changes:\n\n```\n{\n\"type\": \"identify\",\n\"sentAt\": \"2023-04-15T12:07:41.050Z\",\n\"traits\": {\n  \"first_name\": \"John\",\n  \"last_name\": \"Doe\",\n  \"email\": \"johndoe@example.com\",\n  \"attribute_a\": \"value_a.1\",\n  \"attribute_b\": \"value_b\",\n  \"myObj\": {\n    \"test\": \"value_changed\"\n  },\n  \"myArr\": [\n    \"value1\",\n    \"value3\"\n  ]\n},\n\"userId\": \"john@doe\",\n\"context\": {\n  \"library\": {\n    \"name\": \"rudder-analytics-php\",\n    \"version\": \"1.0.1\",\n    \"consumer\": \"LibCurl\"\n  }\n},\n\"rudderId\": \"86a09397-07e3-4cc4-9bd3-1fa262a5b521\",\n\"messageId\": \"fb203095-df9d-40bd-bcf3-97eb8084fea4\",\n\"timestamp\": \"2023-04-15T13:07:39.000+01:00\",\n\"receivedAt\": \"2023-04-15T12:07:40.222Z\",\n\"request_ip\": \"212.129.29.104\",\n\"originalTimestamp\": \"2023-04-15T12:07:41.050Z\"\n}\n```\n\n7.  Resend your event payload. You should see the new event with only the added/updated attributes. You can also confirm in the Braze dashboard that the attributes were added/updated (by going to the **User Search** tab for the same test user ID).\n\n#### **How do I observe the difference in data point billing due to deduplication?**\n\nIn your Braze dashboard, go to [Subscriptions and usage](https://www.braze.com/docs/user_guide/administrative/app_settings/subscription_and_usage/?redirected=true) and check the metrics by the appropriate date filters (before and after enabling deduplication) to observe the data point differences over that period.\n\n  \n\n#### Does RudderStack support deduplication in case of nested arrays?\n\nRudderStack supports deduplication of simple arrays stored as properties. However, it does not support deduplication of nested arrays/objects, that is, data in the following format:\n\n```\n{\n  \"attributes\": [{\n    \"external_id\": \"userId\",\n    \"pets\": [{\n        \"id\": 1,\n        \"type\": \"dog\",\n        \"breed\": \"beagle\",\n        \"name\": \"Tommy\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"id\": 2,\n        \"type\": \"cat\",\n        \"breed\": \"calico\",\n        \"name\": \"Garfield\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }]\n}\n```\n\nNote that you can still avoid data points consumption by sending your data to Braze using RudderStack.

    "markdown": "# Custify | RudderStack Docs\n\nSend your event data from RudderStack to Custify.\n\n* * *\n\n*     5 minute read  \n    \n\n[Custify](https://www.custify.com/) is a next-generation Customer Success software for B2B SaaS companies. It helps you meet your customers’ needs by reducing user churn and increasing their lifetime value. With Custify, you can get insights on product usage and all data from your CRM, support, billing, and other systems in one place.\n\nRudderStack supports Custify as a destination where you can seamlessly send your customer data.\n\n## Getting started\n\nBefore configuring Custify as a destination in RudderStack, verify if the source platform is supported by Custify by referring to the table below:\n\n| **Connection Mode** | **Web** | **Mobile** | **Server** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Device mode** | \\-  | \\-  | \\-  |\n| **Cloud mode** | **Supported** | **Supported** | **Supported** |\n\nOnce you have confirmed that the source platform supports sending events to Custify, follow these steps:\n\n1.  From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add the source. Then, from the list of destinations, select **Custify**.\n2.  Assign a name to the destination and click **Continue**.\n\n### Connection settings\n\nTo successfully configure Custify as a destination, you need to configure the following settings:\n\n[![Custify connection settings](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/custify-connection-settings.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/custify-connection-settings.webp)\n\n*   **API Key**: This is a mandatory field. Enter the Custify API key used to authenticate the request.\n\n*   **Fall back to anonymousId if userId is not present**: If this setting is enabled, RudderStack will use `anonymousId` to identify the user if `userId` is not present in the event.\n\n## Identify\n\nYou can use the [`identify`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/identify/) call to create or update a user in Custify. RudderStack uses the `userId` or `email` field in the event’s `traits` to do so. Hence, it is highly recommended to include the `userId` or at least the user’s `email` in the `identify` call.\n\nYou can also identify your users with `anonymousId` in case `userId` is not present in the event via the **Fall back to anonymousId if userId is not present** dashboard setting.\n\nA sample `identify` call is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify(\"1hKOmRA4GRlm\", {\n  name: \"Alex Keener\",\n  email: \"alex@example.com\",\n  country: \"USA\"\n});\n```\n\n### Supported mapping\n\nRudderStack maps the following event properties to a subset of the standard Custify user attributes. It also creates a new custom field for the unmapped attributes.\n\n| RudderStack property | Custify property | Presence |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `userId` (or `anonymousId` if `userId` is absent) | `user_id` | Required |\n| `traits.email` / `context.traits.email` | `email` | Required, if `userId` or `anonymousId` is absent. |\n| `traits.phone` / `context.traits.phone` | `phone` | Optional |\n| `traits.sessionCount` / `context.traits.sessionCount` | `session_count` | Optional |\n| `traits.unsubscribedFromEmails` / `context.traits.unsubscribedFromEmails` | `unsubscribed_from_emails` | Optional |\n| `traits.unsubscribedFromCalls` / `context.traits.unsubscribedFromCalls` | `unsubscribed_from_calls` | Optional |\n| `traits.name` / `context.traits.name` | `name` | Optional |\n| `traits.signedUpAt` / `context.traits.signedUpAt` / `timestamp` / `originalTimestamp` | `signed_up_at` | Optional |\n| `traits` / `context.traits` | `custom_attributes` | Optional |\n\n### Removing users from an organization\n\nTo remove a given user from an organization, the following fields must be present in the event’s `context.traits`:\n\n*   `company.id`\n*   `company.remove` (set to `true`)\n\nRudderStack assumes a valid Custify `company_id` in the `company.id` field. Then, it finds the organization corresponding to that ID and dissociates the user from the organization.\n\nA sample `identify` call is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify(\"1hKOmRA4GRlm\", {\n  name: \"Alex Keener\",\n  email: \"alex@example.com\",\n  country: \"USA\",\n  company: {\n    id: \"company_123\",\n    remove: true\n  }\n});\n```\n\nThe above `identify` call updates the user as well as removes them from the company having the `id` as `company_123`.\n\n## Track\n\nRudderStack uses the [Custify Events API](https://docs.custify.com/#tag/Event) to send the [`track`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/track/) events generated by the users’ actions.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Custify expects a `userId` for every `track` call. You can set the `userId` by making an `identify` call before sending any `track` events.\n\nA sample `track` call is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"Order Completed\", {\n  category: \"category\",\n  label: \"label\",\n  value: 120\n});\n```\n\n### Supported mapping\n\nThe following table lists the supported property mappings between RudderStack and Custify for the `track` events:\n\n| RudderStack property | Custify property |\n| --- | --- |\n| `userId` / `anonymousId` | `user_id` |\n| `email` | `email` |\n| `event` | `name` |\n| `timestamp` / `originalTimestamp` | `created_at` |\n\n## Group\n\nYou can use the [`group`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/group/) call to create or update a company in Custify and associate a user to it.\n\nRudderStack assumes that an `identify` call (containing the `userId`) is made before any `group` call. It uses the `groupId` to uniquely identify a group.\n\nA sample `group` call is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.group(\"group01\", {\n  traits: {\n    \"name\": \"Tech Group\",\n    \"size\": 150,\n    \"plan\": \"Pro\"\n  },\n  context: {\n    \"traits\": {\n      \"name\": \"Alex Keener\",\n      \"email\": \"alex@example.com\"\n    }\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### Supported mapping\n\nRudderStack maps the following **optional** `group` traits to a subset of the standard Custify company attributes. It also creates a new custom field for any unmapped attributes.\n\n| RudderStack property | Custify property |\n| --- | --- |\n| `groupId` | `company_id` |\n| `traits.name` | `name` |\n| `traits.industry` | `industry` |\n| `traits.size` | `size` |\n| `traits.website` / `traits.url` | `website` |\n| `traits.plan` | `plan` |\n| `traits.monthlyRevenue` / `traits.mrr` | `monthly_revenue` |\n| `traits.churned` | `churned` |\n| `traits` | `custom_attributes` |\n\n### How RudderStack does the user-organization association\n\nTo do the user-company association, RudderStack first finds the Custify user by looking for the `userId` present in the [`context.traits`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/common-fields/#contextual-fields) object.\n\n*   If `userId` and `groupId` are present in the event, RudderStack associates the Custify user with the organization and sends all user-specific information.\n*   If `userId` and `groupId` are not present, RudderStack first creates the user and the organization in Custify and then does the association.\n\nThe above discussion can be summarized as follows:\n\n| `userId` present? | `groupId` present? | Description | Expected behavior |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| No  | No  | User and the organization do not exist in Custify. | RudderStack creates a new user and organization in Custify and associates both. |\n| No  | Yes | Organization exists in Custify but not the user. | RudderStack creates a new user and associates them with the organization. |\n| Yes | No  | User exists in Custify but not the organization. | RudderStack creates a new organization and associates the user with it. |\n| Yes | Yes | Both the user and the organization exist in Custify | RudderStack does the user-organization association. |\n\nQuestions?

If you choose **MD5**, RudderStack will hash-encode the email address before sending it to Criteo.\n*   **Map Specific Fields to Criteo Fields:** Enter the payload fields and the corresponding mapped fields that RudderStack uses to send the event data to Criteo.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Criteo lets you send additional user or page-related data to add more context to the events. You can set this feature in Criteo with the assistance of your Criteo Account Manager. You can then use the **Map Specific Fields to Criteo Fields** field mapping feature to send the additional data through RudderStack.\n\n*   **Client-side Events Filtering**: This setting lets you specify which events should be blocked or allowed to flow through to Criteo. For more information on this setting, see [Client-side Events Filtering](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/event-filtering/).\n*   **OneTrust Cookie Categories**: This setting lets you map [OneTrust cookie](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/data-governance/consent-management/onetrust/javascript/) /consent groups to RudderStack’s consent purposes.\n*   **Mapping RudderStack events to the Criteo standard events**: This setting triggers the Criteo [Standard Event](https://www.criteo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/CSPOneTag_v1.1.pdf) when you send the mapped RudderStack event. You can specify multiple **Standard Events** for one **Event Name** and vice versa.\n*   **Use device mode to send events**: As this is a [device mode](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#device-mode)\\-only destination, this setting is enabled by default and cannot be disabled .\n\n## Page\n\nThe [`page`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/page/) call lets you track user’s home page along with its associated properties and send this information to Criteo.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> Use this call only to track the home page and add the users to your target audience.\n\nThe home page tag is fired **only** in the following scenarios:\n\n*   When the name of the `page` call is `home`.\n*   When the current URL of the web page is same as the **Home Page URL** specified in the RudderStack dashboard.\n*   When the URL mentioned in the `properties` of the `page` call is same as the **Home Page URL** specified in the RudderStack dashboard.\n\nA sample `page` call is as shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.page(\"category\", \"home\", {\n  path: \"path\",\n  url: \"url\",\n  title: \"title\",\n  search: \"search\",\n  referrer: \"referrer\",\n  testDimension: \"true\",\n})\n```\n\n## Track\n\nThe [`track`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/track/) call lets you capture user events and the properties associated with them.\n\nA sample `track` call is as shown:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"Product Viewed\", {\n  product_id: \"Prod12345\",\n  quantity: 1,\n  price: 19.99,\n  name: \"my product\",\n  category: \"categ 1\",\n  sku: \"p-666\",\n  list: \"Gallery\",\n  testDimension: true,\n  testMetric: true,\n})\n```\n\nIn the above example, RudderStack captures the information related to the `Product Viewed` event and the associated details such as quantity, price, category, etc.\n\n### Supported mappings\n\nThe following table details the mapping of the [RudderStack ecommerce events](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/ecommerce-events-spec/) and the [Criteo OneTag events](https://help.criteo.com/kb/guide/en/all-criteo-onetag-events-and-parameters-vZbzbEeY86/Steps/775825):\n\n| RudderStack event | Required fields | Criteo OneTag event | OneTag Event Name used by Criteo |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `Cart Viewed` | `properties.products.$.price`  <br>`properties.products.$.product_id`  <br>`properties.products.$.quantity` | `Basket/cart tag` | `viewBasket` |\n| `Order Completed` | `properties.products.$.price`  <br>`properties.products.$.product_id`  <br>`properties.products.$.quantity`  <br>`properties.order_id` | `Sales Tag` | `trackTransaction` |\n| `Product List Viewed` | `properties.products.$.product_id` | `Category/keyword search/listing tag` | `viewList` |\n| `Product Viewed` | `properties.product_id` | `Product tag` | `viewItem` |\n| `Product Added` | `properties.product_id`  <br>`properties.price`  <br>`properties.quantity`  <br>`properties.currency` | `Criteo Add to Cart Tag` | `addToCart` |\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Note that:\n> \n> *   For `Product List Viewed` event, Rudderstack sends the `viewList` tag. However, it can also send the `viewSearchResult` or `viewCategory` tag depending upon the availability of the `keywords`, `category` fields and the configuration settings.\n> *   If you need to fire the `Category/keyword search/listing tag` with the appropriate filters, enter the filter categories within the `filters` field in the `Product List Viewed` event properties. See [Send filter category to Criteo](#send-filter-category-to-criteo) for more information.\n\n#### **Send filter category to Criteo**\n\nThe `filters` field is an array of objects that consists of each filter category in every single object. Criteo expects `name`, `operator,` and `value` fields for every filter that needs to be passed to Criteo.\n\nFor example, a simple `Product List Viewed` event that fires a `Category/keyword search/listing Tag` is as shown:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"Product List Viewed\", {\n  email: \"name@domain.com\",\n  zipCode: \"12345\",\n  category: \"abc\",\n  keywords: \"key\",\n  page_number: 1,\n  filters: [\n    {\n      name: \"processor\",\n      operator: \"eq\",\n      value: \"snapdragon\",\n    },\n  ],\n  products: [\n    {\n      product_id: \"223344ffdds3ff3\",\n    },\n    {\n      product_id: \"343344ff5567ff3\",\n    },\n  ],\n})\n```\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### Where can I find the Criteo account/partner ID?\n\n1.

    "markdown": "# Braze destination | RudderStack Docs\n\nSend your event data from RudderStack to Braze.\n\n* * *\n\n*     14 minute read  \n    \n\n[Braze](https://www.braze.com/) is a customer engagement platform that helps you better understand your customers’ in-app behavior and use the insights to improve your users’ app experience.\n\nFind the open source transformer code for this destination in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-transformer/tree/master/src/v0/destinations/braze).\n\n## Setup\n\n1.  In your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), go to **Directory** > **Destinations** > **Cloud Destinations** and search for **Braze**.\n2.  Connect your source and click **Continue**.\n\n### Connection settings\n\nConfigure the following settings to set up Braze as a destination in RudderStack:\n\n*   **Name**: Assign a name to uniquely identify the destination.\n*   **App Key**: Enter your Braze app key. For more information on obtaining your Braze app key, see [FAQ](#faq).\n*   **REST API Key**: Enter the REST API key associated with your project. For more information on obtaining this key, see [FAQ](#faq).\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> When creating a new Braze Rest API Key for your app, select the following permissions in the **User Data** section:\n> \n> *   **users.track**: For creating/updating users and registering events.\n> *   **users.identify**: For identity resolution of identified and anonymous users.\n> *   **users.alias.new** and **users.merge**: For aliasing users.\n> *   **users.export.ids**: For [deduplication](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/braze/deduplication/).\n\n*   **Data Center**: Specify the data center associated with your Braze account. To get your data center details, log in to your Braze account and note your URL. Some examples of identifying the [Braze instance](https://www.braze.com/docs/user_guide/administrative/access_braze/sdk_endpoints) from the URL are shown:\n\n| URL | Data center instance |\n| --- | --- |\n| [https://dashboard-01.braze.com](https://dashboard-01.braze.com/) | US-01 |\n| [https://dashboard-03.braze.com](https://dashboard-03.braze.com/) | US-03 |\n| [https://dashboard-01.braze.eu](https://dashboard-01.braze.eu/) | EU-01 |\n\n### Connection mode\n\nSpecify how you want to route events from your source to Braze.\n\nRudderStack supports sending events to Braze via the following [connection modes](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/):\n\n| Connection mode | Web | Mobile | Server |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Device mode | **Supported** | **Supported** | \\-  |\n| Cloud mode | **Supported** | **Supported** | **Supported** |\n| Hybrid mode | **Supported** | **Supported** | \\-  |\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Note that:\n> \n> *   This destination supports hybrid mode for the [web](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/), [iOS](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-ios-sdk/) and [Android](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-android-sdk/) sources. For more information, see [Send events in hybrid mode](#send-events-in-hybrid-mode) section.\n> *   In the web device mode integration, that is, when using [JavaScript SDK](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/) as a source, the Braze native SDK is loaded from the `https://js.appboycdn.com/` domain. Based on your website’s content security policy, you might need to [allowlist this domain](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/load-js-sdk/#allowlist-destination-domain) to load the Braze SDK successfully.\n\n### Send events in hybrid mode\n\nYou can use [hybrid mode](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#hybrid-mode) to send all events to Braze from your [web](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/), [iOS](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-ios-sdk/) and [Android](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-android-sdk/) sources.\n\n#### Mobile sources\n\nTo send events via hybrid mode, use the hybrid mode option (highlighted below) while connecting your mobile source to the Braze destination. Then, [add the Braze integration to your project](#add-braze-integration-to-your-project).\n\n[![Braze hybrid mode connection setting](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/braze-hybrid-mode.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/braze-hybrid-mode.webp)\n\n#### Web (JavaScript) source\n\nTo send events via hybrid mode, use the hybrid mode option (highlighted below) while connecting your web source to the Braze destination.\n\n[![Braze hybrid mode connection setting for web](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/braze-hybrid-mode-web.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/braze-hybrid-mode-web.webp)\n\nThen, configure the [Web SDK settings](#web-sdk-settings) to correctly receive data in Braze.\n\n#### Why use hybrid mode\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Certain Braze functionalities like push notifications and in-app messaging require you to load the Braze SDK.\n\nWhen you choose hybrid mode to send events to Braze, RudderStack:\n\n*   Initializes the Braze SDK.\n*   Sends all the user-generated events (`identify`, `track`, `page`, `screen`, and `group`) to Braze only through [cloud mode](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#cloud-mode) and blocks them from being sent via device mode.\n*   Sends the auto-generated events (in-app messages, push notifications that require the Braze SDK) via [device mode](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#device-mode).\n\nWith hybrid mode, you can send the auto-generated and user-generated events to Braze using a single connection.\n\n> ![success](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/tick.svg)\n> \n> *   In hybrid mode, RudderStack sends all the user-generated events to Braze through their REST API and **does not process** them on the client-side - making your app lean and improving load time.\n> *   You can leverage all the cloud mode benefits like [data governance](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/data-governance/) and [tracking plans](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/data-governance/tracking-plans/).\n\n### Configuration settings\n\nAfter completing the initial setup, configure the following settings to correctly receive your data in Braze:\n\n*   **Enable subscription groups in group call**: Turn on this setting to send the subscription group status in your `group` events. For more information, see [Group](#group).\n*   **Use Custom Attributes Operation**: Turn on this setting if you want to use Braze’s [nested custom attributes](https://www.braze.com/docs/user_guide/data_and_analytics/custom_data/custom_attributes/array_of_objects/) functionality to create segments and personalize your messages using a custom attribute object. For more information, see [Send user traits as nested custom attributes](#send-user-traits-as-nested-custom-attributes).\n*   **Track events for anonymous users**: Turn on this setting to track anonymous user activity and send this information to Braze.\n\n### Deduplication settings\n\n*   **Deduplicate Traits**: Turn on this setting to enable traits deduplication for `identify` and `track` calls. See [Braze Deduplication](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/braze/deduplication/) guide for more information on this feature.\n\n### Web SDK settings\n\n*   **Show Braze logs**: Turn on this setting to show Braze logs to the customers.\n*   **Use web push notifications**: Turn on this setting to use [push notifications for web](https://www.braze.com/docs/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/web/push_notifications/integration#step-1-configure-your-sites-service-worker).\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Note that this feature requires you to set up a service worker on your site.\n> \n> *   If your site already registers a service worker, add the following snippet to the service worker file:\n> \n> ```\n> self.importScripts(\"https://js.appboycdn.com/web-sdk/5.0/service-worker.js\");\n> ```\n> \n> *   If you do not have a service worker, create a new file named `service-worker.js` with the above snippet and place it in the root directory of your website.\n\n*   **Enable HTML in-app messages**: Turn on this setting to enable HTML in-app messages.\n\n### Device mode settings\n\nThe following settings are applicable only if you’re sending events to Braze via the [device mode](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#device-mode):\n\n*   **Client-side Events Filtering**: This setting lets you specify which events should be blocked or allowed to flow through to Braze. For more information on this setting, see [Client-side Events Filtering](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/event-filtering/).\n*   **Show Braze logs**: This setting is applicable only while using the [JavaScript SDK](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/) as a source. Turn it on to show the Braze logs to your users.\n*   **OneTrust Cookie Categories**: This setting lets you associate the [OneTrust](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/data-governance/consent-management/onetrust/javascript/) cookie consent groups to Braze.\n\n### Add Braze integration to your project\n\nDepending on your integration platform, follow these steps to add the Braze integration to your project:\n\n1.  Open the `Podfile` of your project and add the following:\n\n2.  Run the `pod install` command.\n3.  Change the SDK initialization to the following snippet:\n\n```\nRudderConfigBuilder *builder = [[RudderConfigBuilder alloc] init];\n[builder withDataPlaneUrl:<data_plane_url>];\n[builder withFactory:[RudderBrazeFactory instance]];\n[RudderClient getInstance:<write_key>; config:[builder build]];\n```\n\n**This device mode integration is supported for Braze v4.4.4 and above**.\n\n1.  Install `RudderBraze` (available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/)) by adding the following to your `Podfile`:\n\n```\npod 'RudderBraze', '~> 1.0.0'\n```\n\n2.  Run the `pod install` command.\n3.  Import the SDK depending on your preferred platform:\n\n4.  Add the imports to your `AppDelegate` file under the `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` method:\n\n```\nlet config: RSConfig = RSConfig(writeKey: WRITE_KEY)\n            .dataPlaneURL(DATA_PLANE_URL)\nRSClient.sharedInstance().configure(with: config)\nRSClient.sharedInstance().addDestination(RudderBrazeDestination())\n```\n\n```\nRSConfig *config = [[RSConfig alloc] initWithWriteKey:WRITE_KEY];\n[config dataPlaneURL:DATA_PLANE_URL];\n[[RSClient sharedInstance] configureWith:config];\n[[RSClient sharedInstance] addDestination:[[RudderBrazeDestination alloc] init]];\n```\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> To send push notification events, see [Send push notifications](#send-push-notification-events).\n\n1.  Add the following under `dependencies` section:\n\n```\nimplementation 'com.rudderstack.android.sdk:core:[1.0,2.0)'\nimplementation 'com.rudderstack.android.integration:braze:[1.3.0,)'\n```\n\n2.  Add the following permissions to the `AndroidManifest.xml` file:\n\n```\n<uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.INTERNET\"></uses-permission>\n<uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE\"></uses-permission>\n```\n\n3.  Change the SDK initialization to the following:\n\n```\n// initialize Rudder SDK\nval rudderClient: RudderClient =\n    RudderClient.getInstance(\n        this,\n        WRITE_KEY,\n        RudderConfig.Builder()\n            .withDataPlaneUrl(DATA_PLANE_URL)\n            .withLogLevel(RudderLogger.RudderLogLevel.DEBUG)\n            .withFactory(BrazeIntegrationFactory.FACTORY)\n            .build()\n    )\n```\n\n1.  Add the RudderStack-Braze module to your app by running the following command:\n\n```\nnpm install @rudderstack/rudder-integration-braze-react-native\n```\n\n```\nyarn add @rudderstack/rudder-integration-braze-react-native\n```\n\n2.  Import the module you added above and add it to your SDK initialization code:\n\n```\nimport rudderClient from \"@rudderstack/rudder-sdk-react-native\";\nimport braze from \"@rudderstack/rudder-integration-braze-react-native\";\nconst config = {\n  dataPlaneUrl: DATA_PLANE_URL,\n  trackAppLifecycleEvents: true,\n  withFactories: [braze]\n};\nrudderClient.setup(WRITE_KEY, config);\n```\n\n1.  Add the following dependency to the `dependencies` section of your `pubspec.yaml` file:\n\n```\nrudder_integration_braze_flutter: ^1.0.1\n```\n\n2.  Run the below command to install the dependency added in the above step:\n\n3.  Import the `RudderIntegrationBrazeFlutter` in your application where you are initializing the SDK:\n\n```\nimport 'package:rudder_integration_braze_flutter/rudder_integration_braze_flutter.dart';\n```\n\n4.  Change the initialization of your `RudderClient` as shown:\n\n```\nfinal RudderController rudderClient = RudderController.instance;\nRudderConfigBuilder builder = RudderConfigBuilder();\nbuilder.withFactory(RudderIntegrationBrazeFlutter());\nrudderClient.initialize(<write_key>, config: builder.build(), options: null);\n```\n\n## Identify\n\nYou can use the [`identify`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/identify/) call to identify a user in Braze in any of the following cases:\n\n*   When the user registers to the app for the first time.\n*   When they log into their app.\n*   When they update their information.\n\nA sample `identify` call is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify(\"1hKOmRA4GRlm\", {\n  email: \"alex@example.com\",\n  name: \"Alex Keener\"\n});\n```\n\n### Deleting a user\n\nYou can delete a user in Braze using the [Suppression with Delete regulation](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/api/user-suppression-api/#adding-a-suppression-with-delete-regulation) of the RudderStack [User Suppression API](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/api/user-suppression-api/).\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> To delete a user, you must specify their `userId` in the event. Additionally, you can specify a custom identifier (optional) in the event.\n\nA sample regulation request body for deleting a user in Braze is shown below:\n\n```\n{\n  \"regulationType\": \"suppress_with_delete\",\n  \"destinationIds\": [\"2FIKkByqn37FhzczP23eZmURciA\"],\n  \"users\": [\n    {\n      \"userId\": \"1hKOmRA4GRlm\",\n      \"<customKey>\": \"<customValue>\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Delta management for `identify` calls\n\nIf you are sending events to Braze via device mode, you can save costs by deduplicating your `identify` calls. To do so, enable the **Deduplicate Traits** dashboard setting. RudderStack then sends only the changed or modified attributes (traits) to Braze.\n\nIt is highly recommended to review Braze’s [data points policy](https://www.braze.com/docs/user_guide/onboarding_with_braze/data_points/) to fully understand how this functionality can help you avoid data overages.\n\n## Track\n\nThe [`track`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/track/) call lets you record the customer events, that is, the actions that they perform, along with any properties associated with them.\n\nA sample `track` call is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"Product Added\", {\n  numberOfRatings: \"12\",\n  name: \"item 1\"\n});\n```\n\n### Order Completed\n\nWhen you call the `track` method for an `Order Completed` event, RudderStack sends the product information present in the event to Braze as **purchases**.\n\nA sample `Order Completed` event is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"Order Completed\", {\n  userId: \"1hKOmRA4GRlm\",\n  currency: \"USD\",\n  products: [\n    {\n      product_id: \"123454387\",\n      name: \"Game\",\n      price: 15.99\n    }\n  ]\n});\n```\n\n## Page\n\nThe [`page`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/page/) call allows you to record your website’s page views, with the additional relevant information about the viewed page.\n\nA sample `page` call is as shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.page(\"Cart\", \"Cart Viewed\", {\n  path: \"/cart\",\n  referrer: \"test.com\",\n  search: \"term\",\n  title: \"test_item\",\n  url: \"http://test.in\"\n});\n```\n\n## Screen\n\nThe [`screen`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/screen/) call lets you record your users’ mobile screen views with any additional information about the viewed scren.\n\nA sample `screen` call is shown below:\n\n```\n[[RSClient sharedInstance] screen:@\"Main\"\n                properties:@{@\"prop_key\" : @\"prop_value\"}];\n```\n\n## Group\n\nYou can use the [`group`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/group/) call to link an identified user with a group, such as a company, organization, or an account.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack does not support sending `group` events to Braze in the device mode.\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.group(\"12345\", {\n  name: \"MyGroup\",\n  industry: \"IT\",\n  employees: 450,\n  plan: \"basic\"\n});\n```\n\nOnce you send a `group` event, RudderStack sends a custom attribute to Braze with the name as `ab_rudder_group_<groupId>` and the value as `true`. For example, if the `groupId` is `123456`, then RudderStack creates a custom attribute with the name `ab_rudder_group_123456` and sends it to Braze with its value to `true`.\n\n### Subscription group status\n\nTo update the subscription group status, enable the **Enable subscription groups in group call** setting in the RudderStack dashboard and send the [subscription group](https://www.braze.com/docs/api/endpoints/subscription_groups) status in the `group` call:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.group(\"12345\", {\n  subscriptionState: \"subscribed\",\n  email: \"alex@example.com\"\n});\n```\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Either the `email` or `phone` is **mandatory** to send the subscription group in a `group` call.\n\n## Alias\n\nThe [`alias`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/alias/) call lets you merge different identities of a known user.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack supports the `alias` call for Braze only in [cloud mode](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#cloud-mode).\n\nA sample `alias` call is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.alias(\"user123\", \"previous123\");\n```\n\nWhen you make the above call, RudderStack removes the user having `previousId` as `previous123` from Braze and merges all the associated fields with the user having `userId` as `user123`.\n\n## Advanced features\n\nThis section covers some advanced Braze operations that you can perform using RudderStack.\n\n### Send user traits as nested custom attributes\n\nYou can send the user traits to Braze as [nested custom attributes](https://www.braze.com/docs/user_guide/data_and_analytics/custom_data/custom_attributes/nested_custom_attribute_support/) and perform add, update, and remove operations on them. To do so, enable the **Use Custom Attributes Operation** dashboard setting in RudderStack while configuring the Braze destination.\n\nYou can send the user traits as nested custom attributes in your `identify` events in the following format:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify(\"1hKOmRA4GRlm\", {\n  cars: {\n    add: [\n      {\n        age: 27,\n        id: 1,\n        name: \"Alex Keener\"\n      }\n    ],\n    update: [\n      {\n        age: 30,\n        id: 2,\n        identifier: \"id\",\n        name: \"Rowan\"\n      },\n      {\n        age: 27,\n        id: 1,\n        identifier: \"id\",\n        name: \"Mike\"\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  country: \"USA\",\n  email: \"alex@example.com\",\n  firstName: \"Alex\",\n  gender: \"M\",\n  pets: [\n    {\n      breed: \"beagle\",\n      id: 1,\n      name: \"Scooby\",\n      type: \"dog\"\n    },\n    {\n      breed: \"calico\",\n      id: 2,\n      name: \"Garfield\",\n      type: \"cat\"\n    }\n  ]\n});\n```\n\nTo send the user traits as custom user attributes via the `track`, `page`, or `screen` calls, pass `traits` as a contextual field in the event.\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\n  \"Product Viewed\",\n  {\n    revenue: 8.99,\n    currency: \"USD\"\n  },\n  {\n    traits: {\n      cars: {\n        add: [\n          {\n            age: 27,\n            id: 1,\n            name: \"Alex Keener\"\n          }\n        ],\n        update: [\n          {\n            age: 30,\n            id: 2,\n            identifier: \"id\",\n            name: \"Mike\"\n          },\n          {\n            age: 27,\n            id: 1,\n            identifier: \"id\",\n            name: \"Rowan\"\n          }\n        ]\n      },\n      city: \"Disney\",\n      country: \"USA\",\n      email: \"alexa@example.com\",\n      firstName: \"Alexa\",\n      gender: \"woman\",\n      pets: [\n        {\n          breed: \"beagle\",\n          id: 1,\n          name: \"Scooby\",\n          type: \"dog\"\n        },\n        {\n          breed: \"calico\",\n          id: 2,\n          name: \"Garfield\",\n          type: \"cat\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n);\n```\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> Note that:\n> \n> *   For the `update` and `remove` operations, `identifier` is a required key.\n> *   If `add`, `update`, or `remove` operations are not present in the nested array, RudderStack uses the `create` operation to create the properties, by default.\n\nFor more information on sending nested custom attributes to Braze, see the [Braze documentation](https://www.braze.com/docs/user_guide/data_and_analytics/custom_data/custom_attributes/nested_custom_attribute_support/).\n\n### Send push notification events\n\nDepending on your iOS SDK version, follow these steps to send push notification events to Braze:\n\n1.  Follow the [Braze documentation](https://www.braze.com/docs/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/swift/push_notifications/integration#push-notification-certificate) to generate a push notification certificate.\n2.  Add the following code to your `AppDelegate` file under the `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` method:\n\n```\n[[UIApplication sharedApplication] registerForRemoteNotifications];\n\nUNUserNotificationCenter *center = UNUserNotificationCenter.currentNotificationCenter;\n[center setNotificationCategories:BRZNotifications.categories];\ncenter.delegate = self;\nUNAuthorizationOptions options = UNAuthorizationOptionAlert | UNAuthorizationOptionSound | UNAuthorizationOptionBadge;\nif (@available(iOS 12.0, *)) {\n    options = options | UNAuthorizationOptionProvisional;\n}\n[center requestAuthorizationWithOptions:options\n                      completionHandler:^(BOOL granted, NSError *_Nullable error) {\n    NSLog(@\"Notification authorization, granted: %d, \"\n          @\"error: %@)\",\n          granted, error);\n}];\n```\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> You must assign the delegate object using `center.delegate = self` synchronously before your app finishes launching - preferably in `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions`. Otherwise, your app may miss any incoming push notificaitons. See [Apple’s `UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate` documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/unusernotificationcenterdelegate) for more information.\n\n3.  Register push tokens with Braze:\n\n```\n// - Register the device token with Braze\n- (void)application:(UIApplication *)application didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:(NSData *)deviceToken {\n    if ([RudderBrazeFactory instance].integration) {\n        [[RudderBrazeFactory instance].integration didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:deviceToken];\n    }\n}\n```\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Make sure that `RudderBrazeFactory` is initialized before making calls to this push API.\n> \n> Since the Braze push API is designed as an instance method, it relies on the SDK that is correctly initialized beforehand. To do this, you can utilize the [`dispatch_after`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/dispatch/1452876-dispatch_after) API.\n\n4.  Enable push handling:\n\n```\n// - Add support for silent notification\n\n- (void)application:(UIApplication *)application didReceiveRemoteNotification:(NSDictionary *)userInfo fetchCompletionHandler: (void (^)(UIBackgroundFetchResult))completionHandler {\n    if ([RudderBrazeFactory instance].integration) {\n        [[RudderBrazeFactory instance].integration didReceiveRemoteNotification:userInfo fetchCompletionHandler:completionHandler];\n    }\n}\n\n// - Add support for push notifications\n\n- (void)userNotificationCenter:(UNUserNotificationCenter *)center didReceiveNotificationResponse:(UNNotificationResponse *)response withCompletionHandler:(void (^)(void))completionHandler {\n    if ([RudderBrazeFactory instance].integration) {\n        [[RudderBrazeFactory instance].integration didReceiveNotificationResponse:response withCompletionHandler:completionHandler];\n    }\n}\n\n// - Add support for displaying push notification when the app is currently running in the foreground\n\n- (void)userNotificationCenter:(UNUserNotificationCenter *)center willPresentNotification:(UNNotification *)notification withCompletionHandler: (void (^)(UNNotificationPresentationOptions))completionHandler {\n    if (@available(iOS 14, *)) {\n        completionHandler(UNNotificationPresentationOptionList |\n                          UNNotificationPresentationOptionBanner);\n    } else {\n        completionHandler(UNNotificationPresentationOptionAlert);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> According to [Braze documentation](https://www.braze.com/docs/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/swift/push_notifications/integration#step-3-enable-push-handling), invoking the push integration code within the application’s main thread is recommended.\n\nAdd the following code to your `AppDelegate` file under the `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` method:\n\n```\nif #available(iOS 10, *) {\n    let center = UNUserNotificationCenter.current()\n    center.delegate = self\n    var options: UNAuthorizationOptions = [.alert, .sound, .badge]\n    if #available(iOS 12.0, *) {\n        options = UNAuthorizationOptions(rawValue: options.rawValue | UNAuthorizationOptions.provisional.rawValue)\n        }\n        center.requestAuthorization(options: options) { (granted, error) in\n            RSClient.sharedInstance().pushAuthorizationFromUserNotificationCenter(granted)\n    }\n    UIApplication.shared.registerForRemoteNotifications()\n} else {\n    let types: UIUserNotificationType = [.alert, .badge, .sound]\n    let setting: UIUserNotificationSettings = UIUserNotificationSettings(types: types, categories: nil)\n    UIApplication.shared.registerUserNotificationSettings(setting)\n    UIApplication.shared.registerForRemoteNotifications()\n}\n```\n\n```\nif (floor(NSFoundationVersionNumber) > NSFoundationVersionNumber_iOS_9_x_Max) {\n  UNUserNotificationCenter *center = [UNUserNotificationCenter currentNotificationCenter];\n  center.delegate = self;\n  UNAuthorizationOptions options = UNAuthorizationOptionAlert | UNAuthorizationOptionSound | UNAuthorizationOptionBadge;\n  if (@available(iOS 12.0, *)) {\n  options = options | UNAuthorizationOptionProvisional;\n  }\n  [center requestAuthorizationWithOptions:options\n                        completionHandler:^(BOOL granted, NSError * _Nullable error) {\n      [[RSClient sharedInstance] pushAuthorizationFromUserNotificationCenter:granted];\n  }];\n  [[UIApplication sharedApplication] registerForRemoteNotifications];\n} else {\n  UIUserNotificationSettings *settings = [UIUserNotificationSettings settingsForTypes:(UIUserNotificationTypeBadge | UIUserNotificationTypeAlert | UIUserNotificationTypeSound) categories:nil];\n  [[UIApplication sharedApplication] registerForRemoteNotifications];\n  [[UIApplication sharedApplication] registerUserNotificationSettings:settings];\n}\n```\n\n### Send in-app message events\n\nTo send in-app message events to Braze:\n\n1.  Add the following line to your `Podfile` for Braze IAM support:\n\n2.  Navigate to your Xcode app project directory and run `pod install`.\n3.  Import the BrazeUI SDK in your `AppDelegate.m` file:\n\n4.  Add a static variable to your `AppDelegate.m` file to keep a reference to the Braze instance throughout your app’s lifetime:\n\n5.  Add the following code in your `AppDelegate.m` file just after the RudderStack iOS SDK initialization snippet:\n\n```\nid<RSIntegrationFactory> brazeFactoryInstance = [RudderBrazeFactory instance];\n// RudderStack SDK initialization\n[[RSClient getInstance] onIntegrationReady:brazeFactoryInstance withCallback:^(NSObject *brazeInstance) {\n    if (brazeInstance && [brazeInstance isKindOfClass:[Braze class]]) {\n        braze = (Braze *)brazeInstance;\n        [self configureIAM];\n    } else {\n        NSLog(@\"Error getting Braze instance.\");\n    }\n}];\n```\n\n```\nlet brazeFactoryInstance = RudderBrazeFactory()\n// RudderStack SDK initialization\nRSClient.getInstance().onIntegrationReady(brazeFactoryInstance) { brazeInstance in\n    if let brazeInstance = brazeInstance as? Braze {\n        AppDelegate.braze = brazeInstance\n        self.configureIAM()\n    } else {\n        print(\"Error getting Braze instance.\")\n    }\n}\n```\n\n6.  Add the `configureIAM` method in the `AppDelegate.m` file:\n\n```\n-(void) configureIAM {\n    // Refer here: https://www.braze.com/docs/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/swift/in-app_messaging/customization/setting_delegates/#setting-the-in-app-message-delegate\n    BrazeInAppMessageUI *inAppMessageUI = [[BrazeInAppMessageUI alloc] init];\n    braze.inAppMessagePresenter = inAppMessageUI;\n}\n```\n\n```\nfunc configureIAM() {\n    // Refer here: https://www.braze.com/docs/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/swift/in-app_messaging/customization/setting_delegates/#setting-the-in-app-message-delegate\n    let inAppMessageUI: BrazeInAppMessageUI = BrazeInAppMessageUI()\n    AppDelegate.braze?.inAppMessagePresenter = inAppMessageUI\n}\n```\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### Where can I find the Braze App Key and REST API Key?\n\n1.

    "markdown": "# Branch | RudderStack Docs\n\nSend your event data from RudderStack to Branch.\n\n* * *\n\n*     5 minute read  \n    \n\n[Branch.io](https://branch.io/) is an industry leader in cross-platform attribution, mobile app measurement, and deep linking. Many top-ranking apps use Branch to increase their performance and revenue through better performance and engagement.\n\nFind the open source transformer code for this destination in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-transformer/tree/master/src/v0/destinations/branch).\n\n## Getting started\n\nRudderStack supports sending events to Branch via the following [connection modes](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/):\n\n| **Connection Mode** | **Web** | **Mobile** | **Server** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Device mode** | \\-  | **Supported** | \\-  |\n| **Cloud mode** | **Supported** | **Supported** | \\-  |\n\nOnce you have confirmed that the source platform supports sending events to Branch, follow these steps:\n\n1.  From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add a source. Then, from the list of destinations, select **Branch Metrics**.\n2.  Assign a name to the destination and click **Continue**.\n\n## Connection settings\n\nTo successfully set up Branch as a destination, you will need to configure the following settings:\n\n*   **Branch key**: Enter your Branch key from the **Settings** section in the [Branch dashboard](https://dashboard.branch.io/#/settings). For more information on obtaining this key, see [FAQ](#faq).\n*   **Map Your Events To Branch Events**: Use this setting to map your RudderStack events to specific Branch events from the dropdown.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Note that:\n> \n> *   This setting is currently available in cloud mode only.\n> *   The mappings specified using this setting override the [default event mappings](#ecommerce-event-mapping) configured by RudderStack internally.\n\n[![Branch event mapping setting](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/branch-event-mapping-ui.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/branch-event-mapping-ui.webp)\n\n*   **Client-side Events Filtering**: This setting lets you specify which events should be blocked or allowed to flow through to Branch. For more information on this setting, see the [Client-side Events Filtering](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/event-filtering/) guide.\n*   **OneTrust cookie consent settings**: This setting lets you associate [OneTrust](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/data-governance/consent-management/onetrust/javascript/) cookie consent groups to Branch.\n\n## Adding device mode integration\n\nDepending on your platform of integration, follow the below steps below to integrate Branch with your app.\n\n1.  Open the `Podfile` of your project and add the following line:\n\n```\npod 'Rudder-Branch', '2.0.0'\n```\n\n2.  Run the `pod install` command.\n3.  Change the SDK initialization to the following:\n\n```\nRudderConfigBuilder *builder = [[RudderConfigBuilder alloc] init];\n[builder withDataPlaneUrl:<data_plane_url>];\n[builder withFactory:[RudderBranchFactory instance]];\n[builder withLoglevel:RudderLogLevelDebug];\n[RudderClient getInstance:<write_key> config:[builder build]];\n```\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> This device mode integration is supported for Branch v1.41.0 and above.\n\nFollow these steps to add Branch to your iOS project:\n\n1.  Install `RudderBranch` (available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/)) by adding the following line to your `Podfile`:\n\n```\npod 'RudderBranch', '~> 1.0.0'\n```\n\n2.  Run the `pod install` command.\n3.  Then, import the SDK depending on your preferred platform:\n\n4.  Next, add the imports to your `AppDelegate` file under the `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` method:\n\n```\nlet config: RSConfig = RSConfig(writeKey: WRITE_KEY)\n            .dataPlaneURL(DATA_PLANE_URL)\n\nRSClient.sharedInstance().configure(with: config)\nRSClient.sharedInstance().addDestination(RudderBranchDestination())\n```\n\n```\nRSConfig *config = [[RSConfig alloc] initWithWriteKey:WRITE_KEY];\n[config dataPlaneURL:DATA_PLANE_URL];\n\n[[RSClient sharedInstance] configureWith:config];\n[[RSClient sharedInstance] addDestination:[[RudderBranchDestination alloc] init]];\n```\n\nYour Android project must be on **version 5.0 (API level 21) or higher** for RudderStack to be able to send events to Branch.\n\nOnce confirmed, follow these steps to add Branch to your Android project:\n\n1.  Open your `app/build.gradle` (Module: app) file, add the following\n\n```\nrepositories {\n    mavenCentral()\n}\n```\n\n2.  Add the following under `dependencies` section:\n\n```\nimplementation 'com.rudderstack.android.sdk:core:[1.20.1, 2.0.0)'\nimplementation 'com.rudderstack.android.integration:branch:2.0.0'\n```\n\n3.  If needed, add the following **optional** dependencies required by Branch in the `dependencies` section:\n\n```\n// required if your app is in the Google Play Store (tip: avoid using bundled play services libs)\nimplementation 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-ads-identifier:17.1.0+'\n// alternatively, use the following lib for getting the AAID\n// implementation 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-ads:17.2.0'\n// optional\n// Chrome Tab matching (enables 100% guaranteed matching based on cookies)\nimplementation 'androidx.browser:browser:1.0.0'\n// Replace above with the line below if you do not support androidx\n// implementation 'com.android.support:customtabs:28.0.0'\n```\n\n4.  Change the initialization of the SDK with the following:\n\n```\n// initialize Rudder SDK\nval rudderClient: RudderClient =\n    RudderClient.getInstance(\n        this,\n        WRITE_KEY,\n        RudderConfig.Builder()\n            .withDataPlaneUrl(DATA_PLANE_URL)\n            .withLogLevel(RudderLogger.RudderLogLevel.DEBUG)\n            .withFactory(BranchIntegrationFactory.FACTORY)\n            .build()\n    )\n```\n\n## Identify\n\nThe [`identify`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/identify/) call associates a user to their actions and also captures the traits associated with that user.\n\nA sample `identify` call captured from the RudderStack iOS SDK is as shown:\n\n```\n[[RudderClient sharedInstance] identify:@\"developer_user_id\"];\n```\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> You can call `identify` when the user registers to the app for the first time, logs into the app, or updates their information.\n\n## Track\n\nThe [`track`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/track/) call lets you record the customer events along with any properties associated with them.\n\nA sample `track` call is shown below:\n\n```\n[[RudderClient sharedInstance] track:@\"test_event\"\n                          properties:@{@\"key\":@\"value\", @\"foo\": @\"bar\"}]\n```\n\nAll the events tracked by RudderStack are divided into three major Branch event categories:\n\n*   [Commerce events](https://help.branch.io/developers-hub/docs/tracking-commerce-content-lifecycle-and-custom-events#track-commerce-events)\n*   [Content events](https://help.branch.io/developers-hub/docs/tracking-commerce-content-lifecycle-and-custom-events#track-content-events)\n*   [Lifecycle events](https://help.branch.io/developers-hub/docs/tracking-commerce-content-lifecycle-and-custom-events#track-lifecycle-events)\n\n### Ecommerce event mapping\n\nThe following table lists the mapping between the [RudderStack ecommerce events](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/ecommerce-events-spec/) and the Branch [commerce events](https://help.branch.io/developers-hub/docs/tracking-commerce-content-lifecycle-and-custom-events#available-events):\n\n| RudderStack event | Branch event |\n| --- | --- |\n| `Product Added` | `ADD_TO_CART` |\n| `Product Added to Wishlist` | `ADD_TO_WISHLIST` |\n| `Cart Viewed` | `VIEW_CART` |\n| `Checkout Started` | `INITIATE_PURCHASE` |\n| `Payment Info Entered` | `ADD_PAYMENT_INFO` |\n|

Completed` | `PURCHASE` |\n| `Reserve` | `RESERVE` |\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack also maps the `Spend Credits` event to Branch’s `SPEND_CREDITS`, although it is not directly a part of the ecommerce events.\n> \n> However, note that the Android device mode integration **does not** support this mapping.\n\n### Content event mapping\n\nThe following table lists the mapping between the RudderStack events and the Branch Content events:\n\n| RudderStack event | Branch event |\n| --- | --- |\n| `Products Searched` | `SEARCH` |\n| `Product Viewed` | `VIEW_ITEM` |\n| `Product List Viewed` | `VIEW_ITEMS` |\n| `Product Reviewed` | `RATE` |\n| `Product Shared` | `SHARE` |\n| `Initiate Stream` | `INITIATE_STREAM` |\n| `Complete Stream` | `COMPLETE_STREAM` |\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> The above mentioned events are a part of the RudderStack ecommerce events but are mapped to Branch’s Content events.\n\n### Lifecycle event mapping\n\nRudderStack supports mapping the following Branch lifecycle events:\n\n| RudderStack event | Branch event |\n| --- | --- |\n| `Complete Registration` | `COMPLETE_REGISTRATION` |\n| `Complete Tutorial` | `COMPLETE_TUTORIAL` |\n| `Achieve Level` | `ACHIEVE_LEVEL` |\n| `Unlock Achievement` | `UNLOCK_ACHIEVEMENT` |\n| `Invite` | `INVITE` |\n| `Login` | `LOGIN` |\n| `Start Trial` | `START_TRIAL` |\n| `Subscribe` | `SUBSCRIBE` |\n\n## Reset\n\nThe `reset` method resets the previously identified user and related information.\n\nA sample `reset` call is shown:\n\n```\n[[RSClient getInstance] reset];\n```\n\n## Property mappings\n\nThe following table lists the mapping of the accepted RudderStack properties common to all events:\n\n| RudderStack property | Branch property |\n| --- | --- |\n| `title` | `$og_title` |\n| `description` | `$og_description` |\n| `image_url` | `$og_image_url` |\n| `canonical_identifier` | `$canonical_identifier` |\n| `publicly_indexable` | `$publicly_indexable` |\n| `price` | `$price` |\n| `locally_indexable` | `$locally_indexable` |\n| `quantity` | `$quantity` |\n| `sku` | `$sku` |\n| `name` | `$product_name` |\n| `brand` | `$product_brand` |\n| `category` | `$product_category` |\n| `variant` | `$product_variant` |\n| `rating_average` | `$rating_average` |\n| `rating_count` |

RudderStack recommends turning it off if you are already sending hashed data in your events.\n*   **Consent management settings**: This setting lets you associate the cookie consent groups to Campaign Manager 360. Specify the consent management provider from the dropdown and enter the category IDs.\n    \n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> You can also pass values for these dashboard settings in the [track](#track) events. Note that these values will take precedence over the dashboard settings. See the [Campaign Manager 360 documentation](https://developers.google.com/doubleclick-advertisers/rest/v3.5/Conversion) for more information on these settings.\n\n## Track\n\nYou can use the [`track`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/track/) call to capture user events along with the associated properties and send them to Campaign Manager 360.\n\nA sample `track` call is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"Product Reviewed\", {\n  \"profileId\": 437689,\n  \"floodlightConfigurationId\": \"213123123\",\n  \"ordinal\": \"3\",\n  \"floodlightActivityId\": \"456543345245\",\n  \"mobileDeviceId\": \"mobileDeviceId\",\n  \"value\": 7,\n  \"encryptedUserId\": \"encrepyteduserId\"\n  \"impressionId\": \"string\",\n  \"limitAdTracking\": false,\n  \"childDirectedTreatment\": true,\n  \"encryptionInfo\": {\n    \"kind\": \"dfareporting#encryptionInfo\",\n    \"encryptionSource\": \"AD_SERVING\",\n    \"encryptionEntityId\": \"3564523\",\n    \"encryptionEntityType\": \"DCM_ACCOUNT\"\n  },\n  \"requestType\": \"batchinsert\"\n})\n```\n\n### Send enhanced conversions\n\nThe Campaign Manager 360 Conversions API supports [sending enhanced website tag-based conversions](https://developers.google.com/doubleclick-advertisers/guides/conversions_ec) with user identifiers.\n\nTo use this feature, you must first accept the [Enhanced Conversions Terms of Service](https://support.google.com/sa360/answer/12863936) for your Floodlight configuration in Campaign Manager 360 by following these steps:\n\n1.  Log in to your Campaign Manager 360 account.\n2.  Select the advertiser for which you want to set up the enhanced conversions.\n3.  Go to **Floodlight** > **Configuration** in the left sidebar and select the checkbox under the **Enhanced Conversion** section.\n\nTo send enhanced conversions to Campaign Manager 360, toggle on the **Enhanced conversions** setting in the [dashboard](#connection-settings) and set `properties.requestType` to `batchupdate` in your `track` events, as shown:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\n  \"Product Reviewed\", {\n    \"profileId\": \"34245\",\n    \"floodlightConfigurationId\": \"213123123\",\n    \"ordinal\": \"string\",\n    \"floodlightActivityId\": \"456543345245\",\n    \"value\": \"756\",\n    \"quantity\": \"455678\",\n    \"gclid\": \"string\",\n    \"encryptionSource\": \"AD_SERVING\",\n    \"encryptionEntityId\": \"3564523\",\n    \"encryptionEntityType\": \"DCM_ACCOUNT\",\n    \"requestType\": \"batchupdate\"\n  }, {\n    email: \"alex@example.com\",\n    firstName: \"Alex\",\n    lastName: \"Keener\",\n    address: {\n      street: \"350 Blue Gum Street\",\n      city: \"New Orleans\",\n      state: \"Louisiana\",\n      country: \"US\",\n      postalCode: \"90009\",\n    },\n  },\n);\n```\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Note that:\n> \n> *   You must enhance the conversions with user identifiers within 24 hours after they are captured by the online tags.\n> *   A conversion can have a maximum of five user identifiers.\n\nFor security purposes, RudderStack automatically hash-encrypts the user identifiers before sending them to Campaign Manager 360. Make sure to turn off the **Hash user identifiers** dashboard setting if you are already tracking hashed user data via RudderStack.\n\n### Property mappings\n\nThe following table lists the event property mappings between RudderStack and Campaign Manager 360:\n\n| RudderStack property | Campaign Manager 360 property | Data type |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `properties.floodlightActivityId`  <br>Required | `floodlightActivityId` | String |\n| `properties.floodlightConfigurationId`  <br>Required | `floodlightConfigurationId` | String |\n| `properties.ordinal`  <br>Required | `ordinal` | String |\n| `properties.quantity`  <br>Required | `quantity` | String |\n| `timestamp`  <br>Required | `timestampMicros` | Timestamp in ISO 8601 format |\n| `properties.profileId`  <br>`config.profileId` | `profileId` | Number |\n| `properties.encryptedUserId` | `encryptedUserId` | String |\n| `properties.encryptedUserIdCandidates[]` | `encryptedUserIdCandidates[]` | Array |\n| `properties.dclid` | `dclid` | String |\n| `properties.gclid` | `gclid` | String |\n| `properties.matchId` | `matchId` | String |\n| `properties.mobileDeviceId` | `mobileDeviceId` | String |\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> Apart from the above-mentioned properties marked as required, you must also send the following:\n> \n> *   `properties.requestType` in the conversion event with the value as [`batchinsert`](https://developers.google.com/doubleclick-advertisers/rest/v4/conversions/batchinsert) or [`batchupdate`](https://developers.google.com/doubleclick-advertisers/rest/v4/conversions/batchupdate).\n> *   **At least one** of the optional fields.\n\n#### User identifier mappings for enhanced conversions\n\nThe following table lists the user identifier mappings between RudderStack and Campaign Manager 360:\n\n| RudderStack property | Campaign Manager 360 property |\n| --- | --- |\n| `traits.email`  <br>`context.traits.email` | `hashedEmail` |\n| `traits.phone`  <br>`context.traits.phone` | `hashedPhoneNumber` |\n| `traits.firstName`  <br>`context.traits.firstName` | `addressInfo.hashedFirstName` |\n| `traits.lastName`  <br>`context.traits.lastName` | `addressInfo.hashedLastName` |\n| `traits.street`  <br>`traits.address.street`  <br>`context.traits.street`  <br>`context.traits.address.street` | `addressInfo.hashedStreetAddress` |\n| `traits.city`  <br>`traits.address.city`  <br>`context.traits.city`  <br>`context.traits.address.city` | `addressInfo.city` |\n| `traits.country`  <br>`traits.address.country`  <br>`context.traits.country`  <br>`context.traits.address.country` | `addressInfo.countryCode` |\n| `traits.state`  <br>`traits.address.state`  <br>`context.traits.state`  <br>`context.traits.address.state` | `addressInfo.state` |\n| `traits.postalCode`  <br>`traits.address.postalCode`  <br>`context.traits.postalCode`  <br>`context.traits.address.postalCode` | `addressInfo.postalCode` |\n\nQuestions?

    "markdown": "# Customer.io destination | RudderStack Docs\n\nSend your event data from RudderStack to Customer.io.\n\n* * *\n\n*     7 minute read  \n    \n\n[Customer.io](https://customer.io/) is a popular marketing platform for sending targeted emails and push and SMS notifications to improve customer engagement and overall conversion rate.\n\nFind the open source transformer code for this destination in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-transformer/tree/master/src/v0/destinations/customerio).\n\n## Getting started\n\nRudderStack supports sending event data to Customer.io via the following [connection modes](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/):\n\n| Connection Mode | Web | Mobile | Server |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Device mode** | **Supported** | \\-  | \\-  |\n| **Cloud mode** | **Supported** | **Supported** | **Supported** |\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> In a web device mode integration, that is, using [JavaScript SDK](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/) as a source, RudderStack loads the Customer.io native SDK from the `https://assets.customer.io/` domain. Based on your website’s content security policy, you might need to [allowlist this domain](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/load-js-sdk/#allowlist-destination-domain) to load the Customer.io SDK successfully.\n\nOnce you have confirmed that the platform supports sending events to Customer.io, follow these steps:\n\n1.  From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add the source. From the list of destinations, select **Customer.io**.\n2.  Assign a name to the destination and click **Continue**.\n\n### Connection settings\n\nThe connection settings required to configure Customer.io as a destination in RudderStack are listed below:\n\n*   **Site ID**: Enter your Customer.io site ID.\n*   **API Key**: Enter your Customer.io API key.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> For more information on obtaining your Customer.io site ID and API key, see [FAQ](#faq).\n\n*   **Event sent after setting device token**: Enter the name of the event that is fired immediately after setting the device token.\n*   **Data center**: Choose your Customer.io data center from **US** or **EU**.\n\n*   **Client-side Events Filtering**: This setting lets you specify which events should be blocked or allowed to flow through to Customer.io. For more information on this setting, see the [Client-side Events Filtering](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/event-filtering/) guide.\n\n#### Consent settings\n\n*   **OneTrust Cookie Categories**: This setting lets you associate OneTrust cookie consent groups to Customer.io. For more information on this setting, see the [OneTrust Consent Manager](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/data-governance/consent-management/onetrust/javascript/) guide.\n*   **Ketch Consent Purposes**: This setting lets you associate Ketch consent purposes to Customer.io. For more information on this setting, see the [Ketch Consent Manager](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/data-governance/consent-management/ketch/) guide.\n\n#### Web SDK settings\n\n*   **Use native SDK to send events**: Turn on this setting to send the events through Customer.io’s native JavaScript SDK.\n*   **Send page name in SDK mode**: When sending events in web device mode using the native web SDK, RudderStack sends the page name to Customer.io if this setting is toggled on. Otherwise, Customer.io fetches the page name in the form of a URL.\n*   **Enable in-app message support**: Turn on this setting to send in-app messages to your website using the native web SDK. For more information on setting up in-app messages for your website, see the [Customer.io documentation](https://customer.io/docs/journeys/in-app-getting-started/#javascript-snippet).\n\n## Identify\n\nThe [`identify`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/identify/) call lets you identify a visiting user and associate them to their actions. It also lets you record the traits about them like their name, email address, etc.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> **`userId` is a mandatory field for Customer.io**.\n> \n> If it is not present, RudderStack:\n> \n> *   Uses `email` in [cloud mode](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#cloud-mode). If `email` is absent too, it drops the event.\n> *   Drops the event in [device mode](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#device-mode).\n\nRudderStack also sends the `createdAt` field as `created_at` to Customer.io to register the user signup time. If it is not present in the event, RudderStack automatically assigns the event’s timestamp to `created_at` before sending it to Customer.io.\n\nA sample `identify` call is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify(\"userId\", {\n  name: \"Tintin\",\n  city: \"Brussels\",\n  country: \"Belgium\",\n  email: \"tintin@herge.com\"\n});\n```\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> You cannot use the same `email` to make consecutive `identify` calls with different `userId`.\n\nTo update user information, you can use [`cio_id`](https://customer.io/docs/journeys/identifying-people/#cio_id) - the Customer.io canonical identifier:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify('<cio_id>', {\n  email: '<updated_email>@example.com',\n  id: '<updated_id>'\n});\n```\n\n### Unsubscribing users\n\nYou can pass `unsubscribed: true` in the `identify` call to unsubscribe a user in Customer.io:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify(\"userId\", {\n  email: \"tintin@herge.com\",\n  unsubscribed: true\n});\n```\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Make sure the user ID and the email values match the Customer.io attributes. You can verify this by selecting that user in the [People](https://customer.io/docs/getting-started-people/) page in your Customer.io dashboard and clicking on **Attributes**.\n\n## Track\n\nThe [`track`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/track/) call lets you record the user actions along with their associated properties and send them to Customer.io.\n\nA sample `track` call is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"Track me\", {\n  category: \"category\",\n  label: \"label\",\n  value: \"value\",\n});\n```\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> For anonymous users, Customer.io does not permit an event name of size more than 100 Bytes. RudderStack automatically trims the event names in such a scenario.\n> \n> For more information on the Track API event limits, see the [Customer.io documentation](https://www.customer.io/docs/api/track/#section/Track-API-Event-limits).\n\n## Page\n\nIf you are using a native web SDK, RudderStack loads the Customer.io JavaScript snippet and captures the page views automatically. You can also send the [`page`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/page/) event to record the page views along with the other page-related information.\n\nA sample `page` call is as shown below:\n\n```\n// \"home\" is the name of the page.\nrudderanalytics.page(\"home\", {\n  path: \"path\",\n  url: \"url\",\n  title: \"title\",\n  search: \"search\",\n  referrer: \"referrer\",\n});\n```\n\n## Screen\n\nThe [`screen`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/screen/) call is the mobile equivalent of the [`page`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/page/) call. It lets you record the screen views on your mobile app along with other relevant information about the screen.\n\nIf you have enabled screen views in your app implementation in the [iOS](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-ios-sdk/) or [Android](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-android-sdk/) SDK, RudderStack registers the screen views as `Viewed <screen_name> Screen` under the user’s **Activities** tab.\n\nRudderStack also forwards the event properties to Customer.io as received.\n\nA sample `screen` call using RudderStack’s iOS SDK is shown below:\n\n```\n[[RudderClient sharedInstance] screen:@\"Main\"\n            properties:@{@\"prop_key\" : @\"prop_value\"}];\n```\n\nRudderStack transforms the above event as `Viewed Main Screen` before sending it to Customer.io.\n\n## Group\n\nThe [`group`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/group/) call lets you link an identified user with a group, such as a company, organization, or an account. It also lets you record any custom traits or properties associated with that group and send this information to Customer.io.\n\nA sample `group` call is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.group(\"group@49\", {\n  email: \"help@rudderstack.com\",\n  action: \"identify\"\n})\n```\n\nRudderStack automatically maps the following properties to the corresponding Customer.io properties:\n\n| RudderStack property | Customer.io property | Default value |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `groupId`  <br>Required | `identifiers_object_id` | \\-  |\n| `traits.action`  <br>`properties.action`  <br>Required - if not present, RudderStack sets it to `identify` by default. | `action`  <br>Accepted values are `identify`, `delete`, `delete_relationships`, `add_relationships` | `identify` |\n| `traits` | `attributes` | \\-  |\n| `userId` | `identifiers.id` | \\-  |\n| `context.traits.email`  <br>`properties.email`  <br>`context.externalId.0.id` | `identifiers.email` | \\-  |\n| `traits.objectTypeId` | `identifiers.object_type_id` | `1` |\n\n## Alias\n\nThe [`alias`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/alias/) call lets you merge different identities of a known user. It is an advanced method that lets you change the tracked user’s ID explicitly.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> The `alias` call is applicable only when both the user identities are present in Customer.io. The mapping can be ID to ID, email to email, email to ID, and ID to email.\n\nA sample `alias` call is as shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.alias(\"userId\", \"previousId\");\n```\n\nYou can merge two accounts using `email` as well. RudderStack sets the primary email as `userId` and secondary email as `previousId`.\n\nA sample `alias` call merging two accounts is shown:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.alias(\"<primary.email>\", \"<secondary.email>\");\n```\n\n## Device token registration\n\nRudderStack registers the device token to Customer.io for the following [Application Lifecycle Events](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/application-lifecycle-events-spec/):\n\n*   `Application Installed`\n*   `Application Opened`\n\nTo use this feature, enable the `trackApplicationLifecycleEvents` feature in your mobile SDK implementation code. Also, you need to register your device token after initializing the SDK.\n\nThe following snippets demonstrate registering the device token for iOS and Android:\n\n```\n[[[RudderClient sharedInstance] getContext] putDeviceToken:[self getDeviceToken]];\n```\n\n```\nRudderClient.putDeviceToken(getDeviceToken())\n```\n\nYou can also specify the event name to be fired after setting the device token using the **Event sent after setting device token** dashboard setting.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> Make sure you fire the event just after setting the device token in your app, so RudderStack can immediately register the device token on that event and not delay until the next lifecycle event.\n\nThe following snippets demonstrate how you can send a `device_token_registered` event after setting the device token in your app:\n\n```\n[[RSClient sharedInstance] track:@\"device_token_registered\"];\n```\n\n```\nrudderClient!!.track(\"device_token_registered\")\n```\n\nRudderStack also supports removing the device (identified by `device_id`) whenever you send a custom `Application Uninstalled` event.\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### Where do I find the Customer.io API key and site ID?\n\nTo obtain the Customer.io API key and site ID, follow these steps:\n\n1.  Sign in to your [Customer.io dashboard](https://fly.customer.io/).\n2.  In the left panel, click **Settings** and select **Account Settings**.\n3.  Then, click **API Credentials**. You should find the site ID and API key for your project listed here.\n\n[![Customer.io site ID and API key](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/customerio-siteid-apikey.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/customerio-siteid-apikey.webp)\n\nQuestions?

Each Space is a bucket for you to store and serve files. The free, built-in Spaces CDN minimizes page load times, improves performance, and reduces bandwidth and infrastructure costs.\n\nRudderStack allows you to configure Spaces as a destination to which you can dump your event data seamlessly.\n\n## Setting up Spaces\n\nPlease follow these steps to set up Spaces before adding it as a destination in RudderStack:\n\n*   Login to your DigitalOcean Spaces service\n*   Create a new bucket. Alternatively, you can also use an already existing bucket.\n*   You will need to provide `access key ID` and `secret access key` to authorize RudderStack to write to your bucket.\n*   Make a note of both the `access key ID` and `secret access key` as these will be required while configuring Spaces as a destination.\n\n## Configuring Spaces in RudderStack\n\nIn order to enable dumping data to Spaces bucket, you will first need to add it as a destination to the source from which you are sending event data. Once the destination is enabled, events from RudderStack will start to flow to Spaces bucket. You will start seeing the files created in your Spaces bucket.\n\nTo do so, please follow these steps:\n\n*   Choose a source to which you would like to add DigitalOcean Spaces as a destination. You can also simply create a destination and connect it to a source later.\n*   Select the destination as **Spaces** to your source. Give your destination a name and then click **Next**.\n*   Next, in the **Connection Settings**, fill all fields with the relevant information and click **Next**.\n\n[![](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/screenshot-2020-08-10-at-6.38.46-pm.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/screenshot-2020-08-10-at-6.38.46-pm.webp)\n\n*   If you need any transformation, choose one from the list.

Initialize the RudderStack SDK in the `Application` class’s `onCreate()` method as shown:\n\n```\n// initialize Rudder SDK\nval rudderClient =\n    RudderClient.getInstance(\n        this,\n        WRITE_KEY,\n        RudderConfig.Builder()\n            .withDataPlaneUrl(DATA_PLANE_URL)\n            .withFactory(CleverTapIntegrationFactory.FACTORY)\n            .build()\n    )\n```\n\nFollow these steps to add CleverTap to your iOS project:\n\n1.  Go your `Podfile` and add the `Rudder-CleverTap` extension as shown below:\n\n2.  After adding the dependency followed by `pod install` , you can add the imports to your `AppDelegate.m` file:\n\n```\n#import \"RudderCleverTapFactory.h\"\n```\n\n3.  Change the initialization of your `RudderClient` as shown:\n\n```\nRudderConfigBuilder *builder = [[RudderConfigBuilder alloc] init];\n[builder withDataPlaneUrl:DATA_PLANE_URL];\n[builder withFactory:[RudderCleverTapFactory instance]];\n[RudderClient getInstance:WRITE_KEY config:[builder build]];\n```\n\nTo add CleverTap to your React Native project:\n\n1.  Add the RudderStack-CleverTap module to your app using:\n\n```\nnpm install @rudderstack/rudder-integration-clevertap-react-native\n## OR ##\nyarn add @rudderstack/rudder-integration-clevertap-react-native\n```\n\n2.  Run `pod install` inside the `ios` directory of your project adding `@rudderstack/rudder-integration-clevertap-react-native` to your project.\n    \n3.  Import the module you added above and add it to your SDK initialization code as shown below:\n    \n\n```\nimport rudderClient from \"@rudderstack/rudder-sdk-react-native\"\nimport clevertap from \"@rudderstack/rudder-integration-clevertap-react-native\"\n\nconst config = {\n  dataPlaneUrl: DATA_PLANE_URL,\n  trackAppLifecycleEvents: true,\n  withFactories: [clevertap],\n}\nrudderClient.setup(WRITE_KEY, config)\n```\n\n## Identify\n\nThe [`identify`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/identify/) call lets you associate a user with their actions and capture relevant traits about them. This information includes `userId` and other user information like `name`, `email`, etc.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack requires either `userId` or `email` to send `identify` events to CleverTap.\n\nRudderStack maps the following user traits to the CleverTap attributes:\n\n| **RudderStack** | **CleverTap** |\n| --- | --- |\n| `name` | `Name` |\n| `birthday` | `DOB` |\n| `avatar` | `Photo` |\n| `gender` | `Gender` |\n| `phone` | `Phone` |\n| `email` | `Email` |\n| `employed` | `Employed` |\n| `education` | `Education` |\n| `married` | `Married` |\n| `customerType` | `Customer Type` |\n\nRudderStack sends all other traits to CleverTap as custom attributes.\n\nA sample `identify` call looks like the following:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify(\"userid\", {\n  name: \"Name Surname\",\n  email: \"name@website.com\",\n  phone: \"phone\",\n  birthday: \"birthday\",\n  gender: \"M\",\n  avatar: \"link to image\",\n  title: \"Owner\",\n  organization: \"Company\",\n  city: \"Tokyo\",\n  region: \"ABC\",\n  country: \"JP\",\n  zip: \"100-0001\",\n  Flagged: false,\n  Residence: \"Shibuya\",\n  MSG-email: false\n});\n```\n\nIn the above snippet, RudderStack captures relevant information about the user such as the `email` and `phone`, along with the associated user traits.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Note that:\n> \n> *   If a user already exists, the new values will be updated for that user. RudderStack automatically maps the `userId` (or `anoymousId`) to CleverTap’s `identity` attribute.\n> *   The profile properties `MSG-email`, `MSG-push`, `MSG-sms` and `MSG-whatsapp` are used to set the Do Not Disturb (DND) status for the user. They are always `true` by default, unless you explicitly set them to `false`. For example, to disable push notifications for a user, set `MSG-push` to `false`.\n\n### Privacy options\n\nWhen loading the RudderStack SDK, you can set the following options in the `CLEVERTAP` integrations object:\n\n| Option | Data type | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `optOut` | Boolean | Defaults to `false`. Set to `true` if the user opts out of sharing their data. |\n| `useIP` | Boolean | Defaults to `false`. Set to `true` if the user agrees to share their IP data. |\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.load(\n  \"WRITE_KEY\",\n  \"DATAPLANE_URL\", {\n    configUrl: \"https://api.rudderlabs.com\",\n    logLevel: \"DEBUG\",\n    integrations: {\n      CLEVERTAP: {\n        optOut: true,\n        useIP: true,\n      }\n    }\n  }\n);\n```\n\nCleverTap does a reverse lookup on the IP of the incoming request in the back end to map the user’s location. Under GDPR laws, user consent is required to initiate this lookup. Use the `useIP` flag in the web SDK to provide that consent.\n\nIf `useIP` is set to `true`, the city/country information will populate on the Profile page of the CleverTap dashboard. If set to `false`, then this data won’t be populated, and the city/country information will be shown as `Unknown, Unknown`.\n\nSee the [CleverTap documentation](https://developer.clevertap.com/docs/sdk-changes-for-gdpr-compliance) for more information.\n\n### Deleting a user\n\nYou can delete a user in CleverTap using the [Suppression with Delete regulation](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/api/user-suppression-api/#adding-a-suppression-with-delete-regulation) of the RudderStack [User Suppression API](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/api/user-suppression-api/).\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> To delete a user, you must specify their `userId` in the event. Additionally, you can specify a custom identifier (optional) in the event.\n\nA sample regulation request body for deleting a user in CleverTap is shown below:\n\n```\n{\n  \"regulationType\": \"suppress_with_delete\",\n  \"destinationIds\": [\n    \"2FIKkByqn37FhzczP23eZmURciA\"\n  ],\n  \"users\": [{\n    \"userId\": \"1hKOmRA4GRlm\",\n    \"<customKey>\": \"<customValue>\"\n  }]\n}\n```\n\n## Track\n\nThe [`track`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/track/) call lets you capture user events along with the properties associated with them. The user is associated with `userId` or `anonymousId` by default.\n\nA sample `track` call looks like the following:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"Checked Out\", {\n  Clicked_Rush_delivery_Button: true,\n  total_value: 2000,\n  revenue: 2000,\n})\n```\n\nIn the above snippet, RudderStack captures the information related to the `Checked Out` event, along with any additional info about that event.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> CleverTap does not support nested objects or arrays for custom attributes in the `track` events. Hence, RudderStack converts the nested objects or arrays into strings before sending them to CleverTap.\n\n### Order Completed\n\nWhen you track an event with the name `Order Completed` using the using the RudderStack [Ecommerce Events](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/ecommerce-events-spec/) tracking, RudderStack maps it to CleverTap’s [Charged](https://developer.clevertap.com/docs/events#recording-customer-purchases) event.\n\nA number of RudderStack’s specific fields map to CleverTap’s standard `Charged` event fields\n\n| **RudderStack** | **CleverTap** |\n| --- | --- |\n| `checkout_id` | `Charged ID` |\n| `revenue` | `Amount` |\n| `products` | `Items` |\n\nA sample `Order Completed` event looks like the following:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"Order Completed\", {\n  checkout_id: \"12345\",\n  order_id: \"1234\",\n  affiliation: \"Apple Store\",\n  \"Payment mode\": \"Credit Card\",\n  total: 20,\n  revenue: 15.0,\n  shipping: 22,\n  tax: 1,\n  discount: 1.5,\n  coupon: \"Games\",\n  currency: \"USD\",\n  products: [\n    {\n      product_id: \"123\",\n      sku: \"G-32\",\n      name: \"Monopoly\",\n      price: 14,\n      quantity: 1,\n      category: \"Games\",\n      url: \"https://www.website.com/product/path\",\n      image_url: \"https://www.website.com/product/path.jpg\",\n    },\n    {\n      product_id: \"345\",\n      sku: \"F-32\",\n      name: \"UNO\",\n      price: 3.45,\n      quantity: 2,\n      category: \"Games\",\n    },\n    {\n      product_id: \"125\",\n      sku: \"S-32\",\n      name: \"Ludo\",\n      price: 14,\n      quantity: 7,\n      category: \"Games\",\n      brand: \"Ludo King\",\n    },\n  ],\n})\n```\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> `Order Completed` is a free-flowing event. If you set extra fields like `discount`, `coupon`, `currency`, etc., RudderStack automatically maps them to the `Charged` event properties.\n\n## Page\n\nThe [`page`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/page/) call lets you record your website’s page views with any additional relevant information about the viewed page.\n\nRudderStack sends a `page` event to CleverTap as a `Web Page Viewed <Page_Name>` event.\n\nAn example of a `page` call is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.page(\"Cart\", \"Cart Viewed\", {\n  path: \"/cart\",\n  referrer: \"test.com\",\n  search: \"term\",\n  title: \"test_item\",\n  url: \"http://test.in\",\n})\n```\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> CleverTap does not support nested objects or arrays for custom attributes in the `page` events. Hence, RudderStack converts the nested objects or arrays into strings before sending them to CleverTap.\n\n## Screen\n\nThe [`screen`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/screen/) method lets you record whenever your user views their mobile screen, with any additional relevant information about the screen.\n\nA sample `screen` call is shown:\n\n```\n[[RSClient sharedInstance] screen:@\"Sample Screen Name\"\n        properties:@{@\"prop_key\" : @\"prop_value\"}];\n```\n\nIn the above snippet, RudderStack captures all information related to the screen being viewed, along with any additional info associated with that screen view event. In CleverTap, the above `screen` call will be shown as - `Screen Viewed: <screen_name>` along with the properties.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> CleverTap does not support nested objects or arrays for custom attributes in the `screen` events. Hence, RudderStack converts the nested objects or arrays into strings before sending them to CleverTap.\n\n## Alias\n\nThe [`alias`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/alias/) call lets you merge different identities of a known user.\n\nA sample `alias` call is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.alias(\"newUserId\",\"userId\");\n```\n\n## Configuring push notifications and in-app messages\n\nFollow these steps to configure CleverTap push notifications for your desired platform.\n\n1.  Register push notifications for Android devices on your CleverTap dashboard either by uploading your [FCM credentials](https://developer.clevertap.com/docs/android-push#find-fcm-credentials) or any other supported credentials by navigating to **Settings** > **Channels** > **Mobile Push** > **Android**. Add the following dependency in your project level `build.gradle` file inside the `buildscript`:\n\n```\ndependencies {\n  classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:4.3.5'\n}\n```\n\n2.  Add the following dependencies and plugin to your app level `build.gradle` file:\n\n```\ndependencies {\n  // for push notifications\n  implementation 'com.clevertap.android:clevertap-android-sdk:4.0.0'\n  implementation 'com.google.firebase:firebase-messaging:20.2.4'\n}\napply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'\n```\n\n3.  Place the `google-services.json` downloaded from the `Firebase console` into the root folder of your `app`. Add your `CLEVERTAP_ACCOUNT_ID` , `CLEVERTAP_TOKEN` & `FcmMessageListenerService` to the `application` tag of your app’s `AndroidManifest.xml`:\n\n```\n<meta-data android:name=\"CLEVERTAP_ACCOUNT_ID\" android:value=\"XXX-XXX-XXXX\"></meta-data>\n<meta-data android:name=\"CLEVERTAP_TOKEN\" android:value=\"XXX-XXX\"></meta-data>\n<service android:name=\"com.clevertap.android.sdk.pushnotification.fcm.FcmMessageListenerService\">\n<intent-filter>\n<action android:name=\"com.google.firebase.MESSAGING_EVENT\"></action>\n</intent-filter>\n</service>\n```\n\n4.  Create a notification channel anywhere in your application using the following block of code. You can then use this `channel Id` while creating any campaign in your CleverTap dashboard.\n\n```\nCleverTapAPI.createNotificationChannel(\n    getApplicationContext(),\n    \"yourChannelId\",\n    \"Your Channel Name\",\n    \"Your Channel Description\",\n    NotificationManager.IMPORTANCE_MAX,\n    true\n)\n```\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> For push notifications and In-app messages to function correctly, CleverTap needs to know the `Application` status as early as possible. You can either set `android:name` in your `AndroidManifest.xml` tag to `com.clevertap.android.sdk.Application`. If you have a custom `Application` class, call `ActivityLifecycleCallback.register(this);` before `super.onCreate()`.\n> \n> To learn more about push notifications in CleverTap, see the [CleverTap documentation](https://github.com/CleverTap/clevertap-android-sdk#setup-the-lifecycle-callback---important).\n\n1.  Navigate to **Target** > **Signing & Capabilities** in Xcode.\n2.  Enable **Background Modes/Remote notifications** by navigating to **Targets** > **Your App** > **Capabilities** > **Background Modes** and checking **Remote notifications**.\n3.  Navigate to **Settings** > **Channels** > **Mobile Push** > **iOS**.\n4.  Register push notifications for the iOS devices on your CleverTap dashboard either by uploading your Auth Key or APNS push certificate.\n5.  Add the following code in your app just after initializing RudderStack’s iOS SDK to register push notifications.\n\n```\n#import <usernotifications>\n\n// register for push notifications\nUNUserNotificationCenter* center = [UNUserNotificationCenter currentNotificationCenter];\ncenter.delegate = self;\n[center requestAuthorizationWithOptions:(UNAuthorizationOptionAlert | UNAuthorizationOptionSound | UNAuthorizationOptionBadge)\ncompletionHandler:^(BOOL granted, NSError * _Nullable error) {\n  if (granted) {\n    dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^(void) {\n        [[UIApplication sharedApplication] registerForRemoteNotifications];\n        });\n  }\n}];\n```\n\n6.  Add these handlers for the tokens and push notifications:\n\n```\n#import \"RudderCleverTapIntegration.h\"\n\n- (void)application:(UIApplication *)application didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:(NSData *)deviceToken {\n  [[RudderCleverTapIntegration alloc] registeredForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:deviceToken];\n}\n\n- (void)application:(UIApplication *)application didReceiveRemoteNotification:(NSDictionary *)userInfo fetchCompletionHandler:(void (^)(UIBackgroundFetchResult))completionHandler {\n  [[RudderCleverTapIntegration alloc] receivedRemoteNotification:userInfo];\n  completionHandler(UIBackgroundFetchResultNoData);\n}\n\n- (void)userNotificationCenter:(UNUserNotificationCenter *)center willPresentNotification:(UNNotification *)notification withCompletionHandler:(void (^)(UNNotificationPresentationOptions))completionHandler {\n  completionHandler(UNAuthorizationOptionSound | UNAuthorizationOptionAlert | UNAuthorizationOptionBadge);\n}\n\n- (void)userNotificationCenter:(UNUserNotificationCenter *)center didReceiveNotificationResponse:(UNNotificationResponse *)response withCompletionHandler:(void (^)(void))completionHandler {\n  [[RudderCleverTapIntegration alloc] receivedRemoteNotification:response.notification.request.content.userInfo];\n}\n```\n\n1.  Open the `android` folder of your React Native app and follow the steps listed in the **Android** tab of this section.\n2.  Open the `ios` folder of your React Native app and follow the steps listed in the **iOS** tab of this section.\n\n## Using CleverTap objectId and identity for mapping\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> This section is applicable when sending events in [cloud mode](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#cloud-mode).\n\nCleverTap uniquely identifies each user with two main identifiers, namely `objectId` and `identity`. When you enable the **Use CleverTap ObjectId for Mapping** option in the dashboard, RudderStack uses both `objectId` and `identity` and expects the following mapping:\n\n*   For `identify` events:\n\n| **RudderStack** | **RudderStack** | **CleverTap** | **CleverTap** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **`anonymousId` present?** | **`userId` present?** | **`objectId`** | **`identity`** |\n| Yes | Yes | `anonymousId` | `userId` |\n| Yes | No  | `anonymousId` | \\-  |\n| No  | Yes | CleverTap-generated UUID | `userId` |\n\n*   For `track` events:\n\n| **RudderStack** | **RudderStack** | **CleverTap** | **CleverTap** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **`anonymousId` present?** | **`userId` present?** | **Tracking with** | **Value** |\n| Yes | Yes | `objectId` | `anonymousId` |\n| Yes | No  | `objectId` | `anonymousId` |\n| No  | Yes | `identity` | `userId` |\n\nIf **Use CleverTap ObjectId for Mapping** setting is disabled in the dashboard, RudderStack expects the following mapping for identifying users and tracking events (`track`/`page`/`screen`):\n\n| **RudderStack** | **CleverTap** |\n| --- | --- |\n| `userId` or `anonymousId` | `identity` |\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> **Why use CleverTap `objectId` for mapping?**\n> \n> When you track an unidentified user in CleverTap, a user profile is created with minimal details along with the user activity details. When the same user is then identified with a `userId` without the **Use CleverTap ObjectId for Mapping** option enabled, RudderStack creates another profile for the user with the `userId` identifier (in case of RudderStack) which maps to CleverTap’s `identity` attribute.\n> \n> One way to solve this problem is to track users only in cases where a `userId` is present. To do so, disable the **Enable tracking for anonymous users** option in the RudderStack dashboard. Alternatively, you can turn on the **Use CleverTap ObjectId for Mapping** option in the dashboard which allows you to track the anonymous users and when they are later identified, merge their `anonymousId` with their `userId`.\n\n## Device token upload using cloud mode\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> This section is applicable for the Android and iOS sources when sending events via cloud mode.\n\nWhen the device token is present in `context.device.token` in `identify` calls, RudderStack will use the [CleverTap Device Token Upload API](https://developer.clevertap.com/docs/upload-device-tokens-api) to upload the device token for the identified user. For Android, RudderStack sets the token type as `fcm`. For iOS, it is set as `apns`.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> To use this feature you should have enabled the **Use CleverTap ObjectId for Mapping** option in the dashboard, as RudderStack needs the `objectId` to upload the device token.\n\nQuestions?

RudderStack uses global site tagging in device mode.\n\n## Track\n\nThe [`track`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/track/) call lets you capture user events along with the properties associated with them.\n\nA sample `track` call is as shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track('tshirt', {\n  countingMethod: \"transactions\",\n  revenue: \"2605846\",\n  orderId: \"2605847\"\n});\n```\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> `countingMethod` is a required property that specifies how to count the conversions for a Floodlight activity. The methods to count conversions depend on whether you are creating or editing a [counter](https://support.google.com/campaignmanager/answer/7554821#zippy=%2Cfields-in-event-snippets-for-counter-tags) or [sales](https://support.google.com/campaignmanager/answer/7554821#zippy=%2Cfields-in-event-snippets-for-sales-tags) tag activity.\n> \n> Refer to the [FAQ](#faq) section for more information on counting methods for these tags.\n\nNote that if `countingMethod` is absent in your event properties, RudderStack uses the method specified in the **Floodlight Counting Method** [dashboard setting](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/dcm-floodlight/setting-up-dcm-floodlight-in-rudderstack/#conversion-events) as a fallback value. If you do not specify both these fields, RudderStack gives a “not found” error for the counting method.\n\nThe following table details the `integrations` object mapping for DCM Floodlight:\n\n| **RudderStack property** | **DCM Floodlight property** | **Description** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `COPPA` | `tag_for_child_directed_treatment` | Imposes requirements on the websites/online services operators directed to children under 13 years of age.

It lets you share voice, video, and text chat with friends, game communities, and developers.\n\nFind the open source transformer code for this destination in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-transformer/tree/master/src/v0/destinations/discord).\n\n## Getting started\n\nRudderStack supports sending event data to Discord via the following [connection modes](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/):\n\n| **Connection Mode** | **Web** | **Mobile** | **Server** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Device mode** | \\-  | \\-  | \\-  |\n| **Cloud mode** | **Supported** | **Supported** | **Supported** |\n\nOnce you have confirmed that the source platform supports sending events to Discord, follow these steps:\n\n1.  From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add the source. Then, from the list of destinations, select **Discord**.\n2.  Assign a name to the destination and click **Continue**.\n\n### Connection settings\n\nTo successfully configure Discord as a destination, you need to configure the following settings:\n\n*   **Identify Template**: Enter a template for building a text message while sending an `identify` call to Discord. If not provided, RudderStack uses `User {{name}} with {{traits}} is identified` as the default template.\n*   **Event Name**: Enter the event name for which RudderStack should trigger the `track` call’s event template.\n*   **Event Template**: Enter a template for building a text message while sending a `track` call to Discord. If not provided, RudderStack uses `User {{name}} did {{event}} with {{properties}}` as the default template.\n*   **Regex Matching**: Enable this setting if you want to match multiple event names in the `track` call using a regex. It helps in setting the same event template for the event names matching the regex.\n*   **Embed Flag**: Enable this setting to set an embed message for Discord. If enabled, also specify the following:\n    *   **Title Template**: Enter the template for building the title of the embed message. If not provided, RudderStack uses `Identify/Track call made` as the default title.\n    *   **Description Template**: Enter the template for building the description of the embed message. If not provided, RudderStack uses `Message from RudderStack` as the default description.\n*   **Webhook Url**: Enter the webhook URL of the Discord channel where you want to send the data. You can create it by logging in to [Discord](https://discord.com/login), selecting the channel, and going to the **Channel settings** > **Integrations** > **Create Webhook**.\n*   **Trait**: Enter all traits you want to send to Discord in the text message.\n\n## Identify\n\nYou can use the [`identify`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/identify/) call to create or update a user in Discord.\n\nA sample `identify` call is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify(\"1hKOmRA4GRlm\", {\n  name: \"Alex Keener\",\n  email: \"alex@example.com\",\n  country: \"USA\"\n});\n```\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Either one of the `userId` or `anonymousId` is required to make an `identify` call successfully.\n\nRudderStack sends the above `identify` call to Discord in the following text message format (using the default `identify` template):\n\n*   `User Alex Keener with email: alex@example.com, country: USA is identified`\n*   When the **Embed Flag** setting is enabled and the default values for **Title Template** and **Description Template** are used:\n\n```\n\"content\": \"User Alex Keener with email: alex@example.com, country: USA is identified\",\n\"embeds\": [{\n  \"description\": \"Identify call made\",\n  \"title\": \"Message from Rudderstack \"\n}]\n```\n\nRudderStack sends the text message in the `content` property after converting it into the `identify` template specified in the dashboard. Also, if the **Embed Flag** setting is enabled, it sends the embed message details in the `embeds` property. Refer to the [Discord documentation](https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/webhook) for more information.\n\n## Track\n\nYou can use the [`track`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/track/) call to capture user events along with the properties associated with them.\n\nA sample `track` call is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"Order Completed\", {\n  category: \"category\",\n  label: \"label\",\n  value: 120\n});\n```\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> `event name` is a required property to make a `track` call successfully.\n\nRudderStack sends the above `track` call to Discord in the following text message format (using the default `track` template):\n\n*   `Anonymous user anon_id did Order Completed with category: category, label: label, value: 120`\n*   When the **Embed Flag** setting is enabled and the default values for **Title Template** and **Description Template** are used:\n\n```\n\"content\": \"Anonymous user anon_id did Order Completed with category: category, label: label, value: 120\",\n\"embeds\": [{\n  \"description\": \"Track call made\",\n  \"title\": \"Message from Rudderstack \"\n}]\n```\n\nRudderStack sends the text message in `content` property after converting it into the `track` template specified in the **Event Template** dashboard setting.

via the Dynamic Yield tags), use one of the Dynamic Yield API methods:\n    *   `DYO.getRenderedObjectsOnPage()`: Gets a list of campaigns rendered on the page.\n    *   `DYO.getUserObjectsAndVariations()`: Gets a list of campaigns executed on the page.\n\n[![ActiveCampaign hybrid mode connection setting](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/dy-experiment.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/dy-experiment.webp)\n\n*   For server-side rendered experiments (rendered via the Dynamic Yield [choose variations API](https://dy.dev/reference/choosing-variations)), the chosen variation’s information is available in the API response. See [choose code examples](https://dy.dev/reference/choose-code-examples).\n\nOnce done, you can send the returned experiment/variation data via RudderStack to other tools using a `track` call.\n\nQuestions?

If the subscriber is not present in your account, RudderStack will create a new record for them. Otherwise, RudderStack updates the user records with the latest information.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> To update a subscriber’s email address, use the `new_email` property.\n\nA sample `identify` call is as shown:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify(\n  \"6781206\",\n  {\n    email: \"sampleUser@testmail.com\",\n    tags: [\"Customer\"],\n  },\n  {\n    externalId: [\n      {\n        type: \"dripCampaignId\",\n        id: \"846616660\",\n      },\n    ],\n  }\n)\n```\n\nThe following table lists the properties that RudderStack transforms and maps to Drip’s standard properties:\n\n| **RudderStack Property Name** | **Drip Standard Property** |\n| --- | --- |\n| `email` | `email` |\n| `newEmail` | `new_email` |\n| `userId or anonymousId` | `user_id` |\n| `tags` | `tags` |\n| `removeTags` | `remove_tags` |\n| `prospect` | `prospect` |\n| `euConsent` | `eu_consent` |\n| `euConsentMessage` | `eu_consent_message` |\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> All other fields in `context.traits` will be passed as custom fields.\n\nYou can subscribe a user to a [Email Series Campaign](https://www.drip.com/learn/docs/guides/overview-of-drip) by providing the associated **Campaign ID**. Doing so will add the subscriber directly to that email series campaign.\n\nIf you want to add a subscriber to your account without subscribing them to an email series campaign, use the `identify` call instead. You can also send some additional properties with the `identify` call. These are listed in the following table:\n\n| **RudderStack Property Name** | **Drip Standard Property** |\n| --- | --- |\n| `doubleOptin` | `double_optin` |\n\n## Track\n\nWhen you call the `track` API, RudderStack sends the event to Drip along with its name and all of the specified properties. If you include `revenue` as a property, it will get passed to Drip as the conversion value of the event.\n\nA sample `track` call is as shown:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"randomProduct\", {\n  email: \"sampleUser@rudderstackdrip.com\",\n  revenue: 100,\n})\n```\n\nThe following table lists the properties that RudderStack transforms and maps to Drip’s standard properties:\n\n| **RudderStack Property Name** | **Drip Standard Property** |\n| --- | --- |\n| `email` | `email` |\n| `revenue` | `value` |\n| `occurred_at or originalTimestamp` | `occurred_at` |\n\nQuestions?

To update a user’s email, you need to provide the [Engage Private Key](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/engage/setting-up-engage/#connection-settings) in the dashboard settings.\n\nRudderStack uses the [Create or update a User](https://engage.so/docs/api/users) API to add a new user to your Engage account.\n\nThe following table lists the RudderStack attributes and their mappings with the Engage properties:\n\n| RudderStack property | Engage property | Data type |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `externalId.engageId`, `userId`, `traits.userid`, `traits.id`, `context.traits.userId`, `context.traits.id`  <br>Required | `uid` | Alphanumeric |\n| `traits.firstName`, `traits.firstname`, `traits.first_name`, `context.traits.firstName`, `context.traits.firstname`, `context.traits.first_name` | `first_name` | String |\n| `traits.lastName`, `traits.lastname`, `traits.last_name`, `context.traits.lastName`, `context.traits.lastname`, `context.traits.last_name` | `last_name` | String |\n| `traits.email`, `context.traits.email`, `properties.email` | `email` | String |\n| `traits.phone`, `context.traits.phone`, `properties.phone` | `number` | Number _(In `^[0-9]{7,15}$` format)_ |\n| Other user traits | `meta` | String/Integer/Boolean |\n| `timestamp`, `originalTimestamp` | `createdAt` | Timestamp _(ISO 8601 format)_ |\n| `externalId.engageListId`, `config.listIds` | `lists` | Array of List ID |\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack uses `externalId.engageListId` or `config.listIds` as a fallback value in case `userId`, `externalId.engageId`, `traits.userId`, `traits.id`, or `context.traits.id` is absent in the event.\n\n### Deleting a user\n\nYou can delete a user in Engage using the [Suppression with Delete regulation](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/api/user-suppression-api/#adding-a-suppression-with-delete-regulation) of the RudderStack [User Suppression API](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/api/user-suppression-api/).\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> To delete a user in Engage, you need to specify the [Engage Private Key](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/engage/setting-up-engage/#connection-settings) in the dashboard settings.\n\nA sample regulation request body for deleting a user in Engage is shown below:\n\n```\n{\n  \"regulationType\": \"suppress_with_delete\",\n  \"destinationIds\": [\n    \"2FIKkByqn37FhzczP23eZmURciA\"\n  ],\n  \"users\": [{\n    \"userId\": \"1hKOmRA4GRlm\",\n    \"phone\": \"+1-202-555-0146\",\n    \"email\": \"alex@example.com\"\n  }]\n}\n```\n\nRudderStack deletes the user account in Engage using the [Delete User API](https://engage.so/docs/api/users#delete-user).\n\n## Track\n\nThe [`track`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/track/) call lets you capture user events along with the associated properties and send them to Engage.\n\nRudderStack uses the [Add User events API](https://engage.so/docs/api/users#add-user-events) to send the user events to Engage.\n\nA sample `track` call is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\n  \"Order Completed\", {\n    revenue: 30,\n    currency: \"USD\",\n    userId: \"1hKOmRA4el9Z\" \n  })\n```\n\nThe following table lists the RudderStack attributes and their mappings with the Engage properties:\n\n| RudderStack property | Engage property | Data type |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `externalId.engageId`, `userId`, `traits.userid`, `traits.id`, `context.traits.userId`, `context.traits.id`  <br>Required | `uid` | Alphanumeric |\n| `event`  <br>Required | `event` | String |\n| `originalTimestamp` | `timestamp` | Timestamp _(ISO 8601 format)_ |\n| `properties` | `properties` | Object |\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> The event name must be less than 32 characters. Otherwise, Engage will reject the event.\n\n## Page\n\nThe [`page`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/page/) call lets you record your website’s page views with any additional relevant information about the viewed page.\n\nRudderStack sends the page-related information to Engage using their [Add User events API](https://engage.so/docs/api/users#add-user-events).\n\nThe following table lists the RudderStack event properties and their mappings with the Engage properties:\n\n| RudderStack property | Engage property | Data type |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `externalId.engageId`, `userId`, `traits.userid`, `traits.id`, `context.traits.userId`, `context.traits.id`  <br>Required | `uid` | Alphanumeric |\n| `Visited {Category} {Name} Page`  <br>Required | `event` | String |\n| `originalTimestamp` | `timestamp` | Timestamp _(ISO 8601 format)_ |\n| `properties` | `properties` | Object |\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> The event name must be less than 32 characters. Otherwise, Engage will reject the event.\n\n## Group\n\nYou can use the [`group`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/group/) call to link an identified user to a specific Engage list.\n\nRudderStack subscribes the user to the Engage list using their [Subscribe to a List API](https://engage.so/docs/api/lists#subscribe-to-a-list).\n\nA sample `group` call is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.group(\"group01\", {\n\"userId\": \"1\",\n\"name\": \"Capsule Corp.\",\n\"subscriber_status\": \"false\",\n\"operation\": \"add\"\n});\n```\n\nYou can pass the following parameters in the `group` event along with the `userId` (if known):\n\n| RudderStack property | Engage property | Data type |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `groupId`  <br>Required | `id` | String |\n| `externalId.engageId`, `userId` | `uid` | Alphanumeric |\n| `subscriber_status`  <br>_(Default: `true`)_ | `subscribed` | Boolean |\n| `traits.operation`  <br>_(Acceptable values: `add`/`remove`)_ | \\-  | String |\n\nThe following table lists the additional property mappings with the Engage properties:\n\n| RudderStack property | Engage property | Data type |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `traits.email`, `context.traits.email`, `properties.email`, `context.externalId.0.id`  <br>Required, if `phone` is not present | `email` | String |\n| `traits.phone`, `context.traits.phone`, `properties.phone`  <br>Required, if `email` is not present | `number` | Number _(In `^[0-9]{7,15}$` format)_ |\n| `traits.firstName`, `traits.firstname`, `traits.first_name`, `context.traits.firstName`, `context.traits.firstname`, `context.traits.first_name` | `first_name` | String |\n| `traits.lastName`, `traits.lastname`, `traits.last_name`, `context.traits.lastName`, `context.traits.lastname`, `context.traits.last_name` | `last_name` | String |\n| Other user traits | `meta` | String / Integer / Boolean |\n| `timestamp`, `originalTimestamp` | `createdAt` | Timestamp _(ISO 8601 format)_ |\n\nWhen sending `group` events to Engage, it is important to note the following:\n\n*   To remove a user from a group (`\"operation\": \"remove\"`), you need to provide the `userId` or `externalId` in the event.\n*   If the user’s ID is not known, then either `email` or `phone` is required for looking up the user in Engage.\n*   If a user is found with an associated `email` or `phone` (in that priority), then Engage links the user to the provided Engage List ID. Otherwise, it creates a new user with the provided details and then links them to the List ID.\n\nQuestions?

    "markdown": "# Facebook App Events | RudderStack Docs\n\nSend your event data from RudderStack to Facebook App Events.\n\n* * *\n\n*     9 minute read  \n    \n\n[Facebook App Events](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/app-events/) is Facebook’s event tracking functionality which lets you track events via your app or web page, including user activities such as app installation, purchases, etc.\n\nFind the open source transformer code for this destination in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-transformer/tree/master/src/v0/destinations/fb).\n\n## Get started\n\nRudderStack supports sending event data to Facebook App Events via the following [connection modes](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/):\n\n| Connection Mode | Web | Mobile | Server |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Device mode** | \\-  | **Supported** | \\-  |\n| **Cloud mode** | **Supported** | **Supported** | \\-  |\n\nOnce you have confirmed that the source platform supports sending events to Facebook App Events, follow these steps:\n\n1.  From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add a source. Then, from the list of destinations, select **Facebook App Events**.\n2.  Assign a name to the destination and click **Continue**.\n\n## Connection settings\n\nTo successfully configure Facebook App Events as a destination, you will need to configure the following settings:\n\n**APP ID**: Enter your Facebook App ID. See [FAQ](#faq) for more information on getting your Facebook App ID.\n\nThe following settings are applicable **only if** you are sending events to Facebook using [device mode](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#device-mode):\n\n**Limited Data Use**: Enable this setting to send the end user’s country and state information. Facebook processes the user data according to the data regulations set for that region. See [Limited Data Use](#limited-data-use) for more information on this setting.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> You can allow Facebook to detect your country and state automatically by choosing the **Use Facebook to detect Automatically** option.\n\n*   **Client-side Events Filtering**: This setting lets you specify which events should be blocked or allowed to flow through to Facebook App Events. See [Client-side Events Filtering](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/event-filtering/) for more information.\n*   **OneTrust Cookie Categories**: This setting lets you associate the [OneTrust](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/data-governance/consent-management/onetrust/) cookie consent groups to Facebook App Events.\n\n## Add device mode integration\n\nDepending on your platform of integration, follow the below steps to integrate App Events with your app.\n\n1.  Add the following line to your [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/)`Podfile`:\n\n  \n\n2.  Initialize the Facebook App Events iOS SDK just before intializing the RudderStack iOS SDK:\n\n```\n[[FBSDKApplicationDelegate sharedInstance] application:application\n                             didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:launchOptions];\n```\n\n  \n\n3.  Send the user’s consent to App Events as shown below:\n\nFor **Objective-C**:\n\n```\n// Set AdvertiserTrackingEnabled to YES if a user provides consent\n[FBSDKSettings setAdvertiserTrackingEnabled:YES];\n// Set AdvertiserTrackingEnabled to NO if a user does not provide consent\n[FBSDKSettings setAdvertiserTrackingEnabled:NO];\n```\n\nFor **Swift**:\n\n```\n// Set AdvertiserTrackingEnabled to true if a user provides consent\nSettings.setAdvertiserTrackingEnabled(true)\n// Set AdvertiserTrackingEnabled to false if a user does not provide consent\nSettings.setAdvertiserTrackingEnabled(false)\n```\n\n  \n\n4.  Configure your project by adding the following lines to`(<dict>...</dict>)` in your`Info.plist` :\n\n```\n<key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>\n<array>\n<dict>\n<key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>\n<array>\n<string>fbAPP-ID</string>\n</array>\n</dict>\n</array>\n<key>FacebookAppID</key>\n<string>APP-ID</string>\n<key>FacebookClientToken</key>\n<string>CLIENT-TOKEN</string>\n<key>FacebookDisplayName</key>\n<string>APP-NAME</string>\n```\n\n  \n\n5.  After adding the dependency, register the`RudderFacebookFactory` with your`RudderClient` initialization as a`factory` of`RudderConfig`. To do this, run the following command to import the`RudderFacebookFactory.h` file in your`AppDelegate.m` file:\n\n```\n#import <rudder-facebook>\n```\n\n  \n\n6.  Add the RudderStack iOS SDK initialization:\n\n```\nRSConfigBuilder *builder = [[RSConfigBuilder alloc] init];\n[builder withDataPlaneUrl:DATA_PLANE_URL];\n[builder withFactory:[RudderFacebookFactory instance]];\n[RSClient getInstance:WRITE_KEY config:[builder build]];\n```\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> This device mode integration is supported for Facebook App Events 13.0.0 and above.\n\n1.  Install`RudderFacebookAppEvents` (available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/)) by adding the following line to your`Podfile`:\n\n```\npod 'RudderFacebookAppEvents', '~>; 1.0.0'\n```\n\n  \n\n2.  Run the`pod install` command.\n3.  Import the SDK depending on your preferred platform:\n\n```\nimport RudderFacebookAppEvents\n```\n\n  \n\n```\n@import RudderFacebookAppEvents;\n```\n\n  \n\n4.  Add the imports to your`AppDelegate` file under the`didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` method:\n\n```\nlet config: RSConfig = RSConfig(writeKey: WRITE_KEY)\n            .dataPlaneURL(DATA_PLANE_URL)\n        \nRSClient.sharedInstance().configure(with: config)\nRSClient.sharedInstance().addDestination(RudderFacebookAppEventsDestination())\n```\n\n  \n\n```\nRSConfig *config = [[RSConfig alloc] initWithWriteKey:WRITE_KEY];\n[config dataPlaneURL:DATA_PLANE_URL];\n\n[[RSClient sharedInstance] configureWith:config];\n[[RSClient sharedInstance] addDestination:[[RudderFacebookAppEventsDestination alloc] init]];\n```\n\n1.  Add the repository:\n\n```\nrepositories {\n    mavenCentral()\n}\n```\n\n2.  Add the following lines to your`app/build.gradle` file under the`dependencies` section:\n\n```\nimplementation 'com.rudderstack.android.sdk:core:1.+'\nimplementation 'com.rudderstack.android.integration:facebook:1.0.0'\nimplementation 'com.facebook.android:facebook-android-sdk:11.1.0'\n```\n\n  \n\n3.  Open your`/app/res/values/strings.xml` file and add the following lines. **Replace`[APP_ID` with your actual app ID**.\n\n```\n<string name=\"facebook_app_id\">[APP_ID]</string>\n<string name=\"fb_login_protocol_scheme\">fb[APP_ID]</string>\n```\n\n  \n\n4.  In the`app/manifests/AndroidManifest.xml`file, add a`meta-data` element to the`application` element:\n\n```\n<application ...=\"\" android:label=\"@string/app_name\">\n  ...\n  <meta-data android:name=\"com.facebook.sdk.ApplicationId\" android:value=\"@string/facebook_app_id\"></meta-data>\n  ...\n</application>\n```\n\n5.  Change the initialization of your`RudderClient` in your`Application` class:\n\n```\nval rudderClient = RudderClient.getInstance(\n    this,\n    WRITE_KEY,\n    RudderConfig.Builder()\n        .withDataPlaneUrl(DATA_PLANE_URL)\n        .withFactory(FacebookIntegrationFactory.FACTORY)\n        .build()\n)\n```\n\n## Identify\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> For Facebook App Events, RudderStack supports the`identify` calls only in mobile device mode.\n\nYou can use the [`identify`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/identify/) call to set the `userId` through the `setUserID` method from `AppEventsLogger`.\n\nRudderStack sets the following properties (if available) using the `setUserData` method.\n\n| RudderStack property | Data type | App Events property |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `traits.email`  <br>`context.traits.email` | String | `em` |\n| `traits.firstName`  <br>`context.traits.firstName` | String | `fn` |\n| `traits.lastName`  <br>`context.traits.lastName` | String | `ln` |\n| `traits.phone`  <br>`context.traits.phone` | String | `ph` |\n| `traits.gender`  <br>`context.traits.gender` | String | `ge` |\n| `traits.birthday`  <br>`context.traits.birthday` | String | `db` |\n| `traits.city`  <br>`context.traits.city` | String | `ct` |\n| `traits.state`  <br>`context.traits.state` | String | `st` |\n| `traits.zip`  <br>`context.traits.zip` | String | `zp` |\n| `traits.country`  <br>`context.traits.country` | String | `cn` |\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> Make sure you pass the above properties in their specific format. Otherwise, RudderStack will ignore them and not map to any Facebook properties.\n\nA sample `identify` call for an iOS application is shown below:\n\n```\n[[RSClient sharedInstance] identify:@\"developer_user_id\"\n                                 traits:@{@\"email\": @\"bar@foo.com\"}];\n```\n\n## Track\n\nRudderStack logs the [`track`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/track/) call to Facebook using the `logEvent` method of the `AppEventsLogger` class. It uses the same `eventName` as you have passed in the `track` call along with all `properties`, after converting them into the accepted format.\n\nA sample `track` call for an iOS application is as shown:.\n\n```\n[[RSClient sharedInstance] track:@\"Accepted Terms of Service\"\n                      properties:@{\n                          @\"foo\": @\"bar\",\n                          @\"foo_int\": @134\n                      }];\n```\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> When`revenue` and`currency` are present in the event properties of any`track` call, RudderStack makes a`Purchase` call to Facebook using its`logPurchase` API along with the normal`track` call using the`logEvent` API.\n> \n> If`currency` is absent in the event properties, RudderStack sets the default value to`USD`.\n\n#### **Supported mappings for iOS v2**\n\nThis section lists some `track` event and property mappings which are **applicable only** when sending events via the [iOS v2](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-ios-sdk/ios-v2/) device mode.\n\nThe following table lists the `track` event properties mappings between RudderStack and Facebook App Events:\n\n| RudderStack property | Facebook App Events property |\n| --- | --- |\n| `product_id` | ContentID |\n| `rating` | MaxRatingValue |\n| `name` | AdType |\n| `order_id` | OrderID |\n| `currency` | Currency |\n| `query` | Query |\n| `description` | Description |\n\nThe following table lists the ecommerce events mappings between RudderStack and Facebook App Events:\n\n| RudderStack event | Facebook App Events event |\n| --- | --- |\n| Products Searched | Search |\n| Products Viewed | View Content |\n| Product Added | Add to Cart |\n| Product Added To Wishlist | Add to Wishlist |\n| Payment Info Entered | Add Payment Info |\n| Checkout Started | Initiate Checkout |\n| Order Completed | Purchase |\n| Promotion Clicked | In-App Ad Click |\n| Promotion Viewed | In-App Ad Impression |\n| Product Reviewed | Rate |\n| Spend Credits | Spent Credits |\n\nRudderStack also supports the following Lifecycle events and maps them as it is before sending them to Facebook App Events:\n\n*   Complete Registration\n*   Achieve Level\n*   Complete Tutorial\n*   Unlock Achievement\n*   Subscribe\n*   Start Trial\n\n## Page\n\nThe [`page`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/page/) method lets you record your website’s page views with any additional relevant information about the viewed page. You need not pass the event name as RudderStack automatically sets it to `Viewed Page`.\n\nA sample `page` call using the RudderStack Android SDK is as shown:\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> The`page` call is directly passed on to Facebook as a`track` event via its`logEvent` API, with the event name as`Viewed Page` along with the the associated properties.\n\n## Screen\n\nThe [`screen`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/screen/) call lets you record whenever your user views their mobile screen, with any additional relevant information about the screen.\n\nA sample `screen` call using the RudderStack Android SDK is as shown:\n\n```\n[[RSClient sharedInstance] screen:@\"Home\" properties:@{\n    @\"category\" : @\"launcher\"\n}];\n```\n\nIn the above snippet, RudderStack captures the information related to the viewed screen, such as screen `name` and `category`.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> The above`screen` call is directly passed on to Facebook as a`track` event via its`logEvent` API, with the event name as`Viewed {screen name} screen` along with the the associated properties. The above example will be sent as a`track` event with name`Viewed Home screen` along with its properties.\n\n## Limited Data Use\n\nIn July 2020, Facebook released a [Limited Data Use](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-apis/data-processing-options) feature to give businesses better control over how their data is used in their **California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)** compliance efforts.\n\nUsing this, you can send the **Limited Data Use** data processing parameters to Facebook for each event via RudderStack, so that Facebook can appropriately apply the user’s data choice.\n\nTo use this feature, enable the **Limited Data Use** setting in the RudderStack dashboard and control its behavior via the following data processing parameters:\n\n| **Parameter** | **Default Value** | **Description** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Data Processing Options State | `0` | Use Facebook’s geolocation to determine the end-user’s state. |\n| Data Processing Options Country | `0` | Use Facebook’s geolocation to determine the end-user’s country. |\n\n## Configure App Events SDK based on user consent\n\nThis section highlights the different consent-based options for configuring the App Events SDK.\n\n### Disable automatically logged events\n\nTo disable automatic event logging, open the application’s`.plist` as code in Xcode and add the following XML to the property dictionary:\n\n```\n<key>FacebookAutoLogAppEventsEnabled</key>\n<false></false>\n```\n\nIn some cases, you can delay the collection of automatically logged events to obtain user consent or fulfill legal obligations instead of disabling it entirely. To do so, call the`setAutoLogAppEventsEnabled` method of the`FBSDKSettings` class to re-enable auto-logging after the end-user provides the required consent.\n\nIn **Objective-C**:\n\n```\n[FBSDKSettings setAutoLogAppEventsEnabled:YES];\n```\n\nIn **Swift**:\n\n```\nFBSDKSettings.setAutoLogAppEventsEnabled(true)\n```\n\nTo suspend event collection for any reason, set the`setAutoLogAppEventsEnabled` method to`NO` for iOS or`false` for Swift:\n\nIn **Objective-C**:\n\n```\n[FBSDKSettings setAutoLogAppEventsEnabled:NO];\n```\n\nIn **Swift**:\n\n```\nFBSDKSettings.setAutoLogAppEventsEnabled(false)\n```\n\n  \n\nTo disable automatically logged events, add the following to your`AndroidManifest.xml` file:\n\n```\n<application>\n  ...\n  <meta-data android:name=\"com.facebook.sdk.AutoLogAppEventsEnabled\" android:value=\"false\"></meta-data>\n  ...\n</application>\n```\n\nIn some cases, you can delay the collection of automatically logged events to obtain user consent or fulfill legal obligations instead of disabling it entirely. To do so, call the`setAutoLogAppEventsEnabled()` method of the`FacebookSDK` class and set it to`true` . This re-enables event logging after the end-user has provided the required consent.\n\n```\nsetAutoLogAppEventsEnabled(true);\n```\n\nTo suspend event logging again for any reason, set the`setAutoLogAppEventsEnabled()` method to`false`:\n\n```\nsetAutoLogAppEventsEnabled(false);\n```\n\n### Disable collection of advertiser IDs\n\nTo disable the collection of advertiser ID, open the application’s`.plist` as code in Xcode and add the following XML to the property dictionary:\n\n```\n<key>FacebookAdvertiserIDCollectionEnabled</key>\n<false></false>\n```\n\nIn some cases, you can delay the collection of`advertiser_id` to obtain the user consent or fulfill any legal obligations instead of disabling it entirely. To do so, call the`setAdvertiserIDCollectionEnabled` method of the`FBSDKSettings` class and set it to`YES` for iOS, or`true` for Swift after the end-user provides consent:\n\nIn **Objective-C**:\n\n```\n[FBSDKSettings setAdvertiserIDCollectionEnabled:@YES];\n```\n\nIn **Swift**:\n\n```\nFBSDKSettings.setAdvertiserIDCollectionEnabled(true);\n```\n\nTo suspend collection for any reason, set the`setAdvertiserIDCollectionEnabled` method to`NO` for iOS or`false` for Swift.\n\nIn **Objective-C**:\n\n```\n[FBSDKSettings setAdvertiserIDCollectionEnabled:@NO];\n```\n\nIn **Swift**:\n\n```\nFBSDKSettings.setAdvertiserIDCollectionEnabled(false)\n```\n\n  \n\nTo disable collection of`advertiser-id`, add the following code to your`AndroidManifest.xml` file:\n\n```\n<application>\n  ...\n  <meta-data android:name=\"com.facebook.sdk.AdvertiserIDCollectionEnabled\" android:value=\"false\"></meta-data>\n  ...\n</application>\n```\n\nIn some cases, you can delay the collection of`advertiser_id` to obtain user consent or fulfill any legal obligations instead of disabling it entirely. To do so, call the`setAdvertiserIDCollectionEnabled()` method of the`FacebookSDK` class and set it to`true` . This re-enables the collection of`advertiser_id` after the end-user provides the required consent:\n\n```\nsetAdvertiserIDCollectionEnabled(true);\n```\n\nTo suspend collection for any reason, set the`setAdvertiserIDCollectionEnabled()` method to`false`:\n\n```\nsetAdvertiserIDCollectionEnabled(false)\n```\n\n### Disable automatic SDK initialization\n\nTo disable automatic SDK initialization in case of the Android SDK, add the following to your`AndroidManifest.xml` file:\n\n```\n<application>\n  ...\n  <meta-data androidname=\"com.facebook.sdk.AutoInitEnabled\" androidvalue=\"false\"></meta-data>\n  ...\n</application>\n```\n\nIn some cases, you can delay the SDK initialization to obtain user consent or fulfill any legal obligations instead of disabling it entirely. To do so, call the class method`setAutoInitEnabled` and set it to`true` to manually initialize the SDK after the end-user provides the required consent.\n\n```\nFacebookSdk.setAutoInitEnabled(true)\nFacebookSdk.fullyInitialize()\n```\n\nStarting from iOS version 14.5, you need to get the device consent to share data with Facebook by setting the `isAdvertiserTrackingEnabled` property. Refer to Facebook’s [Get device consent](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/app-events/getting-started-app-events-ios#get-device-consent) documentation for more information.\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### Where do I get the Facebook App ID?\n\nYou can find the **Facebook App ID** by logging into your [Facebook Developer account](https://developers.facebook.com/), and navigating to the **Home** page of your application’s dashboard:\n\n[![](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/fb-app-events-app-id.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/fb-app-events-app-id.webp)\n\n#### Where do I get the Facebook Client Token?\n\nYou can find the **Facebook Client Token** by logging into your [Facebook Developer account](https://developers.facebook.com/) and navigating to **Settings** > **Advanced** > **Security** section in the application’s dashboard:\n\n[![](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/fb-app-events-client-token.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/fb-app-events-client-token.webp)\n\nQuestions?

    "markdown": "# Set up Facebook Conversions | RudderStack Docs\n\nSend your event data from RudderStack to Facebook Pixel.\n\n* * *\n\n*     5 minute read  \n    \n\nThis guide will help you set up Facebook Conversions as a destination in RudderStack.\n\n## Setup\n\n1.  In your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), go to **Directory** > **Destinations** > **Cloud Destinations** and search for **Facebook Conversions**.\n2.  Connect your source and click **Continue**.\n\n### Connection settings\n\nConfigure the following settings to set up Facebook Conversions as a destination in RudderStack:\n\n*   **Name**: Assign a name to uniquely identify the destination.\n*   **Dataset ID**: Enter the dataset ID. If an existing pixel is linked to your dataset, your dataset ID will be the same as your [Pixel ID](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/fb-pixel/setting-up-fb-pixel/#where-can-i-find-the-pixel-id).\n*   **Business Access Token**: Enter the business access token from your Facebook business account. This is required to send events in cloud mode. For more information on obtaining the business access token, see the [FAQ](#where-can-i-find-the-business-access-token).\n\n### Connection mode\n\nRudderStack supports sending event data to Facebook Conversions only via [cloud mode](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#cloud-mode).\n\n| Connection Mode | Web | Mobile | Server |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Device mode** | \\-  | \\-  | \\-  |\n| **Cloud mode** | **Supported** | \\-  | **Supported** |\n\n### Configuration settings\n\nAfter completing the initial setup, configure the following settings to correctly receive your data in Facebook:\n\n#### **Event settings**\n\n*   **Action Source**: From the dropdown, select the fallback `action_source` value you want to set **if** `action_source` is not present in your event properties. RudderStack provides the following options:\n\n[![Action source setting](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/fb-conversions-action-source.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/fb-conversions-action-source.webp)\n\n#### **Destination settings**\n\n*   **Limited Data Usage**: If turned on, RudderStack takes the data processing information from the payload and sends it to Facebook. The data in the RudderStack payload should be in the following format:\n\n```\n\"context\": {\n  \"dataProcessingOptions\": [\n    [\n      \"LDU\"\n    ],\n    1,\n    1000\n  ],\n  \"fbc\": \"fb.1.1554763741205.AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUvWxYz1234567890\",\n  \"fbp\": \"fb.1.1554763741205.234567890\",\n  \"fb_login_id\": \"fb_id\",\n  \"lead_id\": \"lead_id\",\n  \"device\": {\n    \"id\": \"df16bffa-5c3d-4fbb-9bce-3bab098129a7R\",\n    \"manufacturer\": \"Xiaomi\",\n    \"model\": \"Redmi 6\",\n    \"name\": \"xiaomi\"\n  },\n  \"network\": {\n    \"carrier\": \"AirCarrier\"\n  },\n  \"os\": {\n    \"name\": \"android\",\n    \"version\": \"8.1.0\"\n  },\n  \"screen\": {\n    \"height\": \"100\",\n    \"density\": 50\n  },\n  \"traits\": {\n    \"email\": \"john@example.com\",\n    \"anonymousId\": \"c82cbdff-e5be-4009-ac78-cdeea09ab4b1\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> If this setting is turned on, RudderStack maps the values in the `context.dataProcessingOptions` array to `commonData.data_processing_options`, `commonData.data_processing_options_country`, and `commonData.data_processing_options_state` fields.\n\nYou can set the value of the [`fbc`](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/conversions-api/parameters/fbp-and-fbc/#fbc) parameter using the `context.fbc` field as shown in the above payload.\n\nIf not set explicitly, RudderStack autogenerates it using the following values:\n\n*   Fetches `fbclid` from `context.page.url`.\n    \n*   Uses `originalTimestamp` as the creation time.\n    \n*   Sets `subdomainIndex` to `1`.\n    \n\n*   **Use as Test Destination**: Turn on this setting if you are using this destination for testing purposes and enter the **Test Event Code**. You can find this code in your Facebook dashboard. When turned on, you can check your events in the Facebook dashboard in realtime.\n    \n\n*   **Don’t send external\\_id for user**: If turned on, RudderStack does not send either `userId` or `anonymousId` as the `external_id` to Facebook.\n\n#### **Other settings**\n\n*   **Client-side event filtering**: Specify the events to be discarded or allowed to flow through. For more information, see [Client-side Event Filtering](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/event-filtering/).\n*   **OneTrust cookie consent settings**: This setting lets you associate the [OneTrust](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/data-governance/consent-management/onetrust/javascript/) cookie consent groups to Facebook Conversions.\n*   **Ketch consent settings**: This setting lets you associate the [Ketch](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/data-governance/consent-management/ketch/) cookie consent groups to Facebook Conversions.\n\n#### **Event mapping**\n\nClick the **Set up mapping** button to map your RudderStack events and properties to specific Facebook custom events. You can also use the JSON mapper to set these mappings.\n\n##### **PII properties**\n\nRudderStack provides two options in this setting:\n\n[![PII settings](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/fb-conversions-pii-settings.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/fb-conversions-pii-settings.webp)\n\n*   **Denylist PII Properties**: RudderStack drops the PII properties specified in this field. However, if you toggle on the **Denylist PII Hash Property** setting, RudderStack encrypts the properties in SHA256 format before sending them to Facebook. The following properties are the **default denylisted properties**:\n    \n    *   `email`\n    *   `firstName`\n    *   `lastName`\n    *   `firstname`\n    *   `lastname`\n    *   `first_name`\n    *   `last_name`\n    *   `gender`\n    *   `city`\n    *   `country`\n    *   `phone`\n    *   `state`\n    *   `zip`\n    *   `postalCode`\n    *   `birthday`\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> To hash and send any of the above properties, enter the property name in the **Denylist PII Properties** field and toggle on the **Denylist PII Hash Property** toggle.\n\n*   **Allowlist PII Properties**: The PII properties mentioned in this field are sent to Facebook if they are present in the event’s properties.\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### Where can I find the dataset ID?\n\nTo get your dataset ID, go to your Facebook Ads Manager account. From the left navigation bar, select **Business Tools**, and click **Events Manager** under **Manage Business**.\n\n[![Dataset ID](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/fb-conversions-dataset-id-1.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/fb-conversions-dataset-id-1.webp)\n\nYou should be able to see the ID underneath your site name under **Data Sources**:\n\n[![Dataset ID](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/fb-conversions-dataset-id-2.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/fb-conversions-dataset-id-2.webp)\n\n#### Where can I find the Business Access Token?\n\nIn order to use the Facebook Conversions API, you need to generate an access token using the Facebook Events Manager:\n\n1.  Choose the relevant Facebook Pixel and click the **Settings** tab.\n2.  In the Conversions API section, click **Generate access token** under the **Set up manually** section:\n\n[![FB Conversions generate access token](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/fb-conversions-generate-access-token.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/fb-conversions-generate-access-token.webp)\n\n#### Can I hash my event data before sending it to RudderStack?\n\nYes. Facebook requires all user data, including data coming from `context.traits`, to be hashed. This includes `email`, `phone`, `birthday`, `address`, etc. By default, RudderStack automatically hashes all of the necessary properties for you. However, to hash these traits before sending to RudderStack, you need to send your event as follows:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\n  \"event_name\", {\n    properties\n  }, {\n    integrations: {\n      \"Facebook Conversions\": {\n        hashed: true,\n      },\n    },\n  }\n)\n```\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack accepts any of the following names for Facebook Conversions in the `integrations` object:\n> \n> *   `fb_conversions`\n> *   `fb conversions`\n> *   `FacebookConversions`\n> *   `Facebook Conversions`\n> *   `FB Conversions`\n> *   `Facebook_Conversions`\n\nThe `integrations` object with these key-values notifies RudderStack to not hash the traits in `context.traits` as they are already hashed. Otherwise, RudderStack will hash your data again and Facebook will not be able to match the traits. Keep in mind that Facebook rejects any un-hashed data.\n\n#### Why can’t I can see my events in the RudderStack dashboard but not in the Facebook dashboard?\n\nIt may take up to 24 hours for your events to reflect in the Facebook dashboard.  \nYou can also verify if your events are flowing correctly by enabling the **Use as Test Destination** setting in the RudderStack dashboard. It reflects the events in the Facebook dashboard in real time.\n\nQuestions?
