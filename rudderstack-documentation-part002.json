If yes, it is split into `fn` and `ln` fields. Facebook does not hash the values of `user_data` parameters if you send an `integrations` object in your event as below:\n\n```\n\"integrations\": {\n  \"fb_conversions\": {\n    \"hashed\": true\n  }\n}\n```\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack accepts any of the following names for Facebook Conversions in the `integrations` object:\n> \n> *   `fb_conversions`\n> *   `fb conversions`\n> *   `FacebookConversions`\n> *   `Facebook Conversions`\n> *   `FB Conversions`\n> *   `Facebook_Conversions`\n\n### Custom data\n\nRudderStack flattens the `custom_data` object before sending it Facebook along with the `user_data` and `common_data` fields in the `data` object.\n\nNote that:\n\n*   RudderStack sends the properties present in `custom_data` as is, without any change.\n*   It also excludes `opt_out`, `event_id`, and `action_source` from the event properties.\n\nThe following table explains how RudderStack maps and sets the properties in the specific Facebook fields:\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> Each of the below parameters are applicable/valid only for certain events.\n> \n> See [Standard events mapping](#standard-events-mapping) for more information on the properties mapped for each Facebook property according to the event.\n\n| RudderStack property | Facebook property |\n| --- | --- |\n| Array of product IDs from `properties.products` like `product.product_id`, `product.sku`, `product.id`. | `content_ids` |\n| Array of object containing `id`, `quantity`, and `item_price` formed for each product in `properties.products`. | `contents` |\n| `properties.content_type` | `content_type` |\n| `properties.category` | `content_category` |\n| *   `properties.content_name` or `properties.contentName` if `properties.products` array is **not** present.<br>*   `properties.name` or `properties.product_name` if `properties.products` array is present. | `content_name` |\n| `properties.currency` - defaulted to `USD` if no value is present. | `currency` |\n| `properties.revenue`  <br>`properties.value`  <br>`properties.price`  <br>`properties.total` | `value` |\n| `content_ids.length` | `num_items` |\n| `properties.query` | `search_string` |\n\nNote that `content_category` must be of type String. For more information on this field, see [Facebook developer documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/conversions-api/parameters/custom-data).\n\n*   If `content_category` is passed as an array, RudderStack merges the array elements as a comma-separated string.\n*   If `content_category` is passed as an object, RudderStack throws an error: `\"Category must be must be a string.\"`\n\n#### **PII properties**\n\nFacebook identifies the following event properties as PII properties:\n\n*   `email`\n*   `firstName`\n*   `lastName`\n*   `first_name`\n*   `last_name`\n*   `gender`\n*   `city`\n*   `country`\n*   `phone`\n*   `state`\n*   `zip`\n*   `birthday`\n\nIf any mapped `custom_data` property is among the above properties, RudderStack checks if the property is allowlisted. If no, it is dropped.\n\nIf the property is denylisted, RudderStack checks if the [Denylist PII Hash Property](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/fb-conversions/setup-guide/#pii-properties) toggle is turned on in the dashboard. If no, it is dropped. Otherwise, RudderStack hash-encrypts it before sending to Facebook.\n\nAs mentioned [above](#userdata), if you send an `integrations` object within your event with `hashed` set to `true`, RudderStack does not hash the property again.\n\n```\n\"integrations\": {\n  \"fb_conversions\": {\n    \"hashed\": true\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### App data\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack includes this data only if `action_source` in the `data object` is set to `app`.\n\nThe following table lists the mappings between the RudderStack properties and the Facebook properties:\n\n| RudderStack property | Facebook property |\n| --- | --- |\n| `a2` if `context.device.type` = `android`  <br>`i2` if `context.device.type` = `ios`  <br>Required | `extinfo.0` |\n| `context.device.adTrackingEnabled`  <br>Required | `advertiser_tracking_enabled` |\n| `context.os.version`  <br>Required | `extinfo.4` |\n| `properties.application_tracking_enabled`  <br>Required | `application_tracking_enabled` |\n| `anonymousId` | `user_data.anon_id` |\n| `context.app.namespace` | `extinfo.1` |\n| `context.app.build` | `extinfo.2` |\n| `context.app.version` | `extinfo.3` |\n| `context.device.model` | `extinfo.5` |\n| `context.device.advertisingId` | `user_data.madid` |\n| `context.locale` | `extinfo.6` |\n| `context.abv_timezone` | `extinfo.7` |\n| `context.network_carrier` | `extinfo.8` |\n| `context.screen_width` | `extinfo.9` |\n| `context.screen_height` | `extinfo.10` |\n| `context.screen_density` | `extinfo.11` |\n| `context.cpu_cores` | `extinfo.12` |\n| `context.ext_storage_size` | `extinfo.13` |\n| `context.avl_storage_size` | `extinfo.14` |\n| `context.timezone` | `extinfo.15` |\n| `properties.campaignId`  <br>`context.traits.campaignId`  <br>`context.campaign.name` | `campaign_ids` |\n| `properties.install_referrer` | `install_referrer` |\n| `properties.installer_package` | `installer_package` |\n| `properties.url_schemes` | `url_schemes` |\n| `properties.windows_attribution_id` | `windows_attribution_id` |\n\n## Standard events mapping\n\nRudderStack maps the following events to the Facebook standard events by default:\n\n| RudderStack Event | Facebook Standard Event |\n| --- | --- |\n| `Checkout Started` | `InitiateCheckout` |\n| `Order Completed` | `Purchase` |\n| `Product Added` | `AddToCart` |\n| `Product Added to Wishlist` | `AddToWishlist` |\n| `Payment Info Entered` | `AddPaymentInfo` |\n| `Product List Viewed` | `ViewContent` |\n| `Products Searched` | `Search` |\n| `Product Viewed` | `ViewContent` |\n\nSee the [Ecommerce Events Specification](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/ecommerce-events-spec/) for more information on the above events.\n\nNote that:\n\n*   For the `Purchase` standard event (mapped to `Order Completed` event), `properties.revenue` is a required field. Also, RudderStack sends the `delivery_category` field along with `id`, `item_price` and `quantity` as a part of the [`custom_data.contents`](#data-object-format) object.\n    \n*   For the `Products Searched` event, the `query` property must be a string.\n    \n*   If you map an event with the `ViewContent` standard event using the RudderStack dashboard setting and don’t send the `products` array in the `message.properties` object:\n    \n    ```\n    \"properties\": {\n      \"phone\": 1-202-555-0146,\n      \"email\": \"alex@example.com\",\n      \"category\": \"clothing\",\n      \"list_id\": \"1234\",\n      \"testDimension\": true,\n      \"testMetric\": true\n    }\n    ```\n    \n    Then, `content_ids` is mapped to `properties.category` value (`clothing` in this case) and `quantity` is set to `1` inside the `contents` object.\n    \n\nThe below table elaborates the property mappings between RudderStack and Facebook corresponding to the RudderStack event:\n\n| RudderStack event | RudderStack property | Facebook property |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Checkout Started |\n| `products.$.product_id/products.$.sku/products.$.id` | `content_ids` |\n| `category`  <br>`currency`  <br>`revenue` | `content_category`  <br>`currency`  <br>`value` |\n| `products.$.product_id/products.$.sku/products.$.id`  <br>`products.$.quantity/quantity`  <br>`product.$.price/price` | `contents.id`  <br>`contents.quantity`  <br>`contents.item_price` |\n| Product List Viewed |\n| `products.$.product_id/products.$.sku/products.$.id` | `content_ids` |\n| `category`  <br>`contentName`  <br>`currency`  <br>`value` | `content_category`  <br>`content_name`  <br>`currency`  <br>`value` |\n| `products.$.product_id/products.$.sku/products.$.id`  <br>`products.$.quantity/quantity`  <br>`product.$.price` | `contents.id`  <br>`contents.quantity`  <br>`contents.item_price` |\n| Product Viewed |\n| `product_id/sku/id`  <br>`product_name/name`  <br>`category`  <br>`currency` | `content_ids`  <br>`content_name`  <br>`content_category`  <br>`currency` |\n| `product_id/sku/id`  <br>`quantity`  <br>`price` | `contents.id`  <br>`contents.quantity`  <br>`contents.item_price` |\n| Product Added |\n| `product_id/sku/id`  <br>`product_name/name`  <br>`currency` | `content_ids`  <br>`content_name`  <br>`currency` |\n| `product_id/sku/id`  <br>`quantity`  <br>`price` | `contents.id`  <br>`contents.quantity`  <br>`contents.item_price` |\n| Order Completed |\n| `products.$.product_id/products.$.sku/products.$.id` | `content_ids` |\n| `contentName`  <br>`currency`  <br>`revenue` | `content_name`  <br>`currency`  <br>`value` |\n| `products.$.delivery_category`/`properties.delivery_category`  <br>`products.$.product_id/products.$.sku/products.$.id`  <br>`products.$.quantity/quantity`  <br>`product.$.price/price` | `contents.delivery_category`  <br>`contents.id`  <br>`contents.quantity`  <br>`contents.item_price` |\n| Products Searched | `query`  <br>`product_id/sku/id`  <br>`category`  <br>`currency`  <br>`value` | `search_string`  <br>`content_ids`  <br>`content_category`  <br>`currency`  <br>`value` |\n| `product_id/sku/id`  <br>`quantity`  <br>`price` | `contents.id`  <br>`contents.quantity`  <br>`contents.item_price` |\n| Product Added to Wishlist |\n| `products.$.product_id/products.$.sku/products.$.id` | `content_ids` |\n| `category`  <br>`contentName`  <br>`currency`  <br>`value` | `content_category`  <br>`content_name`  <br>`currency`  <br>`value` |\n| `products.$.product_id/products.$.sku/products.$.id`  <br>`products.$.quantity/quantity`  <br>`product.$.price/price` | `contents.id`  <br>`contents.quantity`  <br>`contents.item_price` |\n| Payment Info Entered |\n| `products.$.product_id/products.$.sku/products.$.id` | `content_ids` |\n| `category`  <br>`currency`  <br>`value` | `content_category`  <br>`currency`  <br>`value` |\n| `products.$.product_id/products.$.sku/products.$.id`  <br>`products.$.quantity/quantity`  <br>`product.$.price/price` | `contents.id`  <br>`contents.quantity`  <br>`contents.item_price` |\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> For all the standard events mentioned above:\n> \n> *   Default values for the `currency` and `quantity` properties are `USD` and `1` respectively.\n> *   `content_ids` field is populated from the `products` array. If the `products` array is not present in the `properties`, `content_ids` is set to an empty array resulting in `num_items` being set to `0`.\n\n### Other standard events\n\nIf you map your event to any of the following Facebook standard events, then RudderStack treats it as a standard event as well:\n\n*   `Lead`\n*   `CompleteRegistration`\n*   `Contact`\n*   `CustomizeProduct`\n*   `Donate`\n*   `FindLocation`\n*   `Schedule`\n*   `StartTrial`\n*   `SubmitApplication`\n*   `Subscribe`\n\nFor any properties you want to send with these events, you must specify them in the [Event Mapping](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/fb-conversions/setup-guide/#event-mapping) settings.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> For the above-mentioned events and [custom events](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/fb-conversions/setup-guide/#custom-event), Rudderstack sends `content_ids` and `num_items` to Facebook as a part of `properties` in the appropriate format.\n\n## Deduplication\n\nFacebook allows you to send events via your web browser and your server via the Conversion API. Depending on how you send your events with this duel setup, there is a possibility of Facebook receiving redundant/duplicate events. Hence, to get an accurate representation of your data, Facebook [deduplicates the incoming events](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/823677331451951?id=1205376682832142).\n\n### Using `event_id`\n\nFacebook’s (and RudderStack’s) **recommended** deduplication strategy is to leverage the `event_name` and `event_id` properties. When two events coming into Facebook meet the following criteria, they are deduplicated.\n\n*   They are sent within 48 hours of each other.\n*   They are received by the same Facebook Pixel ID.\n*   They have the same `event_name`, for example, `Purchase`.\n*   They have the same `event_id`.\n    *   The `event_id` must be unique to that specific event and same for both of the events. For example, the `event_id` could be a purchase order number.\n\nYou can set the `event_id` as a unique identifier in the event’s `traits`, `context.traits`, or the `properties` object. RudderStack automatically picks up the `event_name` from the event.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> If you don’t set the `event_id`, RudderStack uses `messageId` and maps it to Facebook’s `eventId`.\n\nFor more information on the `event_id` deduplication logic, see the [Facebook developer documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/conversions-api/deduplicate-pixel-and-server-events/#event-id-and-event-name---recommended).\n\n### Using `fbp` and `external_id`\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> This deduplication strategy is not recommended as it has a few drawbacks:\n> \n> *   It will always discard the server event if Facebook identifies a redundant event.\n> *   It only works for deduplicating events sent first from the browser and then the server.\n> *   There is no deduplication if two consecutive browser events with the same information are sent to Facebook. The same is true if two server events with the same information are sent to Facebook.\n\nFor this approach, it is necessary to send an event, first from the browser and then from the server. Note that both events must have the same `event_name`, the same `fbp` parameter, and the same `external_id`.\n\nIf the browser event is received before the server event and both events have the same `event_name` and the same `fbp` and `external_id`, then the server event is discarded.\n\nRudderStack maps the `event_name` from the event sent to Facebook. The `fbp` parameter is taken from the `context.fbp` key-value pair. Finally, the `external_id` will be the `userId` or `anonymousId` (if `userId` is not present).\n\nFor more information on the `fbp` and `external_id` deduplication logic, see the [Facebook developer documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/conversions-api/deduplicate-pixel-and-server-events/#fbp-or-external-id).\n\n## Sending custom `content_type`\n\nYou can send a custom [`content_type`](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/meta-pixel/get-started/advantage-catalog-ads#content-type) field by specifying it in the `properties.content_type` field of your event.\n\nRudderStack sets the value of `content_type` in the following priority order:\n\n1.  It gives the highest priority to `properties.content_type` in your event.\n2.  If `properties.content_type` is absent, RudderStack sets the `content_type` to `product` by default, except in the following cases:\n\n*   If **Product List Viewed** event is sent:\n    *   with `products` array, then the `content_type` is set to `product`.\n    *   without the `products` array, then the `content_type` is set to `product_group`.\n*   If **Product Viewed** event is not mapped in RudderStack dashboard (default mapping is set to **View Content** event) but is sent:\n    *   with `products` array, then the `content_type` is set to `product`.\n    *   without the `products` array, then the `content_type` is set to `product_group`.\n*   If any other event is mapped to the Facebook standard event **View Content** in the RudderStack dashboard and is sent:\n    *   with `products` array, then the `content_type` is set to `product`.\n    *   without the `products` array, then the `content_type` is set to `product_group`.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> `product` and `product_group` are the only two acceptable values for `content_type`.\n\nQuestions?

    "markdown": "# Set up Facebook Pixel | RudderStack Docs\n\nSend your event data from RudderStack to Facebook Pixel.\n\n* * *\n\n*     7 minute read  \n    \n\nRudderStack supports sending event data to Facebook Pixel via the following [connection modes](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/):\n\n| **Connection Mode** | **Web** | **Mobile** | **Server** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Device mode** | **Supported** | \\-  | \\-  |\n| **Cloud mode** | **Supported** | **Supported** | **Supported** |\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> In a web device mode integration, that is, using [JavaScript SDK](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/) as a source, the Facebook Pixel native SDK is loaded from `https://connect.facebook.net/` domain. Based on your website’s content security policy, you might need to [allowlist this domain](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/load-js-sdk/#allowlist-destination-domain) to load the Facebook Pixel SDK successfully.\n\nOnce you have confirmed that the source platform supports sending events to Facebook Pixel, follow these steps:\n\n1.  From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add the source. Then, from the list of destinations, select **Facebook Pixel**.\n2.  Assign a name to your destination and click **Continue**.\n\n## Connection settings\n\nTo successfully configure Facebook Pixel as a destination, you will need to configure the following settings:\n\n*   **Facebook Pixel ID**: Enter your Facebook Pixel ID. This is required for sending events via both cloud and device modes.\n*   **Business Access Token**: Enter your Facebook business access token required to send the events via cloud mode.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> For more information on obtaining your Facebook Pixel ID and Business Access Token, refer to the [FAQ](#faq) section below.\n\n### Event settings\n\n*   **Enable Standard Event (PageView) for all Page and Screen Calls**: If this setting is enabled, RudderStack sets `pageview` as a standard event for all `page` and `screen` calls.\n*   **Map your events with Facebook Standard Events**: RudderStack maps some events to the Facebook standard events by default. You can use this option to override the [default mappings](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/fb-pixel/fb-pixel-cloud-mode/#standard-events) and map events to the Facebook standard events.\n*   **Value Field Identifier**: Set this field to `properties.price` or `properties.value`. RudderStack assigns it to the Facebook payload’s `value` field. You can use this setting for the **Product Viewed** or **Product Added** events.\n*   **Enable Advanced Matching**: Enable this setting to update the user information in Facebook Pixel device mode.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> If you enable both the **Enable Advanced Matching** and **Use Updated Mapping** settings, RudderStack maps `external_id` from `userId` > `context.traits.userId` > `context.traits.id` > `anonymousId`, in the mentioned order.\n\n### PII properties settings\n\n*   **Denylist PII Properties**: The PII properties mentioned in this field will not be sent to Facebook if **Denylist PII Hash Property** is not enabled. If it is enabled, the properties will be SHA256-hashed and sent to Facebook. The properties listed below are the **default denylisted properties**.\n    \n    *   `email`\n    *   `firstName`\n    *   `lastName`\n    *   `firstname`\n    *   `lastname`\n    *   `first_name`\n    *   `last_name`\n    *   `gender`\n    *   `city`\n    *   `country`\n    *   `phone`\n    *   `state`\n    *   `zip`\n    *   `postalCode`\n    *   `birthday`\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> If you want to send any of the above properties hashed by SHA256, you need to enter the property name in the **Denylist PII Properties** field and enable the **Denylist PII Hash Property** toggle.\n\n*   **Allowlist PII Properties**: The PII properties mentioned in this field will be sent to Facebook if they are present in the properties of the events. This is only necessary for properties that match the **Default Denylisted PII** properties listed above.\n\n### Other settings\n\n*   **Limited Data Usage**: If enabled, RudderStack will take the data processing information from the payload and send it to Facebook. The data in the RudderStack payload should be as shown below:\n\n```\n\"context\": {\n  \"dataProcessingOptions\": [\n    [\n      \"LDU\"\n    ],\n    1,\n    1000\n  ],\n  \"fbc\": \"fb.1.1554763741205.AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUvWxYz1234567890\",\n  \"fbp\": \"fb.1.1554763741205.234567890\",\n  \"fb_login_id\": \"fb_id\",\n  \"lead_id\": \"lead_id\",\n  \"device\": {\n    \"id\": \"df16bffa-5c3d-4fbb-9bce-3bab098129a7R\",\n    \"manufacturer\": \"Xiaomi\",\n    \"model\": \"Redmi 6\",\n    \"name\": \"xiaomi\"\n  },\n  \"network\": {\n    \"carrier\": \"AirCarrier\"\n  },\n  \"os\": {\n    \"name\": \"android\",\n    \"version\": \"8.1.0\"\n  },\n  \"screen\": {\n    \"height\": \"100\",\n    \"density\": 50\n  },\n  \"traits\": {\n    \"email\": \"john@example.com\",\n    \"anonymousId\": \"c82cbdff-e5be-4009-ac78-cdeea09ab4b1\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nHere, you can send the value of [`fbc`](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/conversions-api/parameters/fbp-and-fbc/#fbc) parameter via `context.fbc` as shown in the above payload. If not sent, RudderStack auto generates it using the following values:\n\n*   Fetches `fbclid` from `context.page.url`\n    \n*   Uses `originalTimestamp` as the creation time\n    \n*   Sets `subdomainIndex` to `1`\n    \n*   Sets `version` to `fb`\n    \n*   **Use as Test Destination:** Enable this setting if you are using this destination for testing purposes and enter the **Test Event Code**. This code can be found in your Facebook Pixel dashboard. When enabled, you can check your events in the Facebook Pixel dashboard in real time.\n    \n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> The `context.dataProcessingOptions` will be mapped to `data_processing_options` in Facebook as is mentioned in the [Facebook developer docs](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/conversions-api/parameters/server-event#data-processing-options).\n\n*   **Don’t send external\\_id for user**: If enabled, RudderStack does not send either `userId` or `anonymousId` as the `external_id` to Facebook Pixel.\n\n### Client-side event filtering\n\nRudderStack supports specifying which events should be discarded or allowed to flow through, when sending events via device mode. For more information, refer to the [Client-side Event Filtering](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/event-filtering/) documentation.\n\n### Web device mode settings\n\n*   **Use Updated Mapping**: If this setting is disabled, RudderStack sends the user traits to Facebook Pixel without any modification. If you enable this setting, RudderStack takes the following traits:\n\n```\n{\n  firstName: \"Alex\",\n  lastName: \"Keener\",\n  email: \"alex@example.com\",\n  phone: \"12345678910\",\n  gender: \"Male\",\n  birthday: \"01012001\",\n  city: \"New Orleans\",\n  country: \"USA\",\n  zip: \"90009\", // You can also send postalCode instead\n  state: \"Louisiana\",\n  foo: \"bar\",\n}\n```\n\nIt then sends the above traits to Facebook Pixel in the following format:\n\n```\n{\n  fn: \"Alex\",\n  ln: \"Keener\",\n  em: \"alex@example.com\",\n  ph: \"12345678910\",\n  ge: \"Male\",\n  db: \"01012001\",\n  ct: \"New Orleans\",\n  country: \"USA\",\n  zp: \"90009\",\n  state: \"Louisiana\",\n  foo: \"bar\"\n}\n```\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> If you enable both the **Enable Advanced Matching** and **Use Updated Mapping** settings, RudderStack maps `external_id` from `userId` > `context.traits.userId` > `context.traits.id` > `anonymousId`, in the mentioned order.\n\n*   **Legacy Conversion Pixel IDs**: With this setting, you can send specific events to a legacy conversion Pixel by specifying the event-Pixel ID mapping. Note that this option is available only when sending events via device mode.\n    \n*   **Enable Automatic Configuration**: Enabled by default, this setting sends button click and page metadata from your website to improve your ads delivery and measurement and automate your Pixel setup. See [Meta documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/meta-pixel/advanced/#automatic-configuration) for more information.\n    \n*   **Use device-mode to send events**: Enable this setting to send events from the JavaScript SDK to Facebook Pixel via [device mode](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#device-mode).\n    \n*   Finally, click **Next** to complete the configuration.\n    \n\n## FAQ\n\n#### Where can I find the Pixel ID?\n\nTo get your Pixel ID, go to your Facebook Ads Manager account. On the left navigation bar, select Business Tools, and click **Events Manager** under **Manage Business**.\n\n[![](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/screen-shot-2021-03-03-at-1.22.01-pm.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/screen-shot-2021-03-03-at-1.22.01-pm.webp)\n\nIn the Data Sources, you should be able to see your Pixel ID underneath your site name.\n\n[![](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/screen-shot-2021-03-03-at-1.19.03-pm.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/screen-shot-2021-03-03-at-1.19.03-pm.webp)\n\n#### Where can I find the Business Access Token?\n\nIn order to use the Facebook Conversions API, you need to generate an access token. We recommend using the Facebook Events Manager to do so, by following these steps:\n\n*   Choose the relevant Facebook Pixel and click the **Settings** tab.\n*   In the Conversions API section, click **Generate access token** under the **Set up manually** section:\n\n[![](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/screen-shot-2021-03-03-at-1.44.33-pm.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/screen-shot-2021-03-03-at-1.44.33-pm.webp)\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> For more information on how to use this access token or to generate your access token via your own app, refer to the [Facebook documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/conversions-api/get-started/#via-events-manager).\n\n#### Can I hash my user data before sending it to RudderStack?\n\nYes. Facebook Pixel requires all user data, data coming from `context.traits`, to be hashed. This includes `email`, `phone`, `birthday`, `address`, etc. By default, RudderStack will automatically hash all of the necessary properties for you. However, if you would like to hash these traits before sending to RudderStack then you need to add this code to the event.\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\n  \"some_event_name\",\n  { some_properties },\n  {\n    integrations: {\n      \"Facebook Pixel\": {\n        hashed: true,\n      },\n    },\n  }\n)\n```\n\nThe `integrations` object with these key-values will tell RudderStack not to hash the traits in `context.traits` because they are already hashed. Otherwise, RudderStack will hash your data again and Facebook will not be able to match the traits. Please keep in mind that Facebook will not accept un-hashed data.\n\n#### I can see my events being sent in the RudderStack dashboard but are not visible in the Facebook Pixel dashboard. What could be the reason?\n\nIt may take upto 24 hours for your events to reflect in the Facebook Pixel dashboard.  \nYou can also verify if your events are flowing correctly by enabling the **Use as Test Destination** setting in the RudderStack dashboard. It reflects the events in the Facebook Pixel dashboard in real time.\n\nQuestions?

    "markdown": "# Facebook Offline Conversions | RudderStack Docs\n\nSend your event data from RudderStack to Facebook Offline Conversions.\n\n* * *\n\n*     6 minute read  \n    \n\n[Facebook Offline Conversions](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1142103235885551?id=565900110447546) lets you measure your sales in the offline world, resulting through your online Facebook ads. It helps you leverage the offline events data by tracking the in-store purchases, phone orders, bookings, etc.\n\n> ![danger](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/danger.svg)\n> \n> **This destination is now deprecated**.\n> \n> To send your event data from RudderStack to Facebook by leveraging the Conversions API, see the [Facebook Conversions](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/fb-conversions/) destination documentation.\n\n## Getting started\n\nRudderStack supports sending event data to Facebook Offline Conversions via the following [connection modes](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/):\n\n| **Connection Mode** | **Web** | **Mobile** | **Server** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Device mode** | \\-  | \\-  | \\-  |\n| **Cloud mode** | **Supported** | **Supported** | **Supported** |\n\nOnce you have confirmed that the source platform supports sending events to Facebook Offline Conversions, follow these steps:\n\n1.  From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add the source. Then, from the list of destinations, select **Facebook Offline Conversions**.\n2.  Assign a name to your destination and click **Continue**.\n\n## Connection settings\n\nTo successfully configure Facebook Offline Conversions as a destination, you will need to configure the following settings:\n\n*   **System User Access Token**: Enter your system user access token from the Facebook Business account. Refer to the [FAQ](#faq) section for more information on obtaining the access token.\n*   **Map your events with Facebook Standard Events**: Use this setting to map the standard Facebook events with custom event names. You can map one or more custom events to a standard Facebook event but **not** vice-versa.\n*   **Map Facebook Standard Events With Event Set IDs**: Use this setting to map the standard Facebook events (specified in the above setting) to Facebook event set ID’s. You can map one or more standard Facebook events to event set ID’s and vice-versa. Refer to the [FAQ](#faq) section for more information on obtaining the event set ID’s.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> If a Facebook standard event is mapped to more than one event set ID, RudderStack will send an event for every event set ID.\n\n*   **Map Categories to Facebook Content Types**: Enter the category value and the corresponding Facebook [`content_type`](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/meta-pixel/get-started/advantage-catalog-ads#content-type) which should be mapped to each other. This `content_type` is sent to Facebook every time you send the specified category value via RudderStack. Refer to the [Sending custom `content_type`](#sending-custom-content_type) section for more information on sending the customized `content_type` to Facebook.\n*   **Value Field Identifier**: Enter the identifier you want to assign to the `value` field in Facebook’s event payload. The default value is set to `properties.value`.\n*   **Limited Data Usage**: Enable this setting to let RudderStack take the data processing information from the payload and send it to Facebook.\n*   **Enable Hashing**: This setting is enabled by default and hash encodes the user data using `SHA256`. Facebook expects the user data to be hash encoded.\n\n## Track\n\nYou can use the [`track`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/track/) call to capture user events along with the properties associated with them.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Facebook’s [conversion attribution window](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/insights#sample) is 28 days. Hence, it is recommended to send your server-side `track` conversions within 62 days of the occurrence of offline conversions.\n\nThe event name sent in the `track` call must be mapped in the **Map Facebook Standard Events With Event Set IDs** RudderStack dashboard setting otherwise, an error is thrown.\n\nA sample `track` call is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track({\n  userId: 'user@1',\n  event: 'Product Added',\n  properties: {\n    products: [{\n      id: 1,\n      category: 'Games',\n      brand: 'Hasbro',\n      price: 18.99,\n      quantity: 1,\n    }],\n    order_id: 'cart1234',\n    price: 18.99,\n    currency: \"USD\"\n  },\n  traits: {\n    email: 'alex@example.com',\n    phone: '+1-202-555-0146',\n    gender: 'male',\n    firstName: 'Alex',\n    lastName: \"Keener\",\n    address: {\n      city: 'New Orleans',\n      state: 'Louisiana',\n      postalCode: '90009',\n      country: 'USA'\n    }\n  },\n  context: {\n    \"dataProcessingOptions\": [\n      [\n        \"LDU\"\n      ],\n      1,\n      1000\n    ],\n  }\n});\n```\n\nIf your server has access to Facebook’s `leadId` from their [Lead Ads](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/guides/lead-ads/) product, you can choose to send it using the integration specific options. The `leadId` is mapped via `externalId`:\n\n```\n\"externalId\": [\n  {\n  \"id\": \"leadId-value\",\n  \"type\": \"LeadId\"\n  }, ]\n```\n\n### Property mappings\n\nThe following table lists the event property mappings between RudderStack and Facebook Offline Conversions:\n\n| RudderStack property | Facebook Offline Conversions property | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `userId`  <br>`traits.userId`  <br>`traits.id`  <br>`context.traits.userId`  <br>`context.traits.id`  <br>`anonymousId`  <br>Required | `extern_id` | \\-  |\n| `originalTimestamp`  <br>`timestamp`  <br>Required | `event_time` | Unix timestamp. The default value is the current timestamp. |\n| `event`  <br>Required | `event_name` | \\-  |\n| `properties.currency`  <br>Required | `currency` | If not provided, the default value is set to `USD`. |\n| `properties.total`  <br>`properties.price`  <br>`properties.value`  <br>`properties.revenue`  <br>Required | `value` (currency value) | If not provided, the default value is set to `0`. |\n| `properties.upload_tag` | `upload_tag` | The default value is set to `RudderStack`. |\n| `properties.item_number` | `item_number` | \\-  |\n| `properties.order_id`  <br>`properties.orderId` | `order_id` | \\-  |\n| `properties` | `custom_data` | \\-  |\n| `properties.products` | `contents` | \\-  |\n| `traits.email`  <br>`context.traits.email`  <br>`properties.email`  <br>`context.externalId.0.id` | `email` | \\-  |\n| `traits.phone`  <br>`context.traits.phone`  <br>`properties.phone` | `phone` | \\-  |\n| `traits.gender`  <br>`context.traits.gender` | `gen` | \\-  |\n| `traits.birthday`  <br>`context.traits.birthday`  <br>`traits.dateOfBirth`  <br>`context.traits.dateOfBirth`  <br>`traits.dateofbirth`  <br>`context.dateofbirth`  <br>`traits.dob`  <br>`context.traits.dob`  <br>`traits.DOB`  <br>`context.traits.DOB` | `doby` | The expected format is `DD, MM, YYYY`. RudderStack extracts the year, month, and day before sending it to Facebook Offline Conversions. |\n| `traits.firstName`  <br>`traits.firstname`  <br>`traits.first_name`  <br>`context.traits.firstName`  <br>`context.traits.firstname`  <br>`context.traits.first_name` | `fn` | \\-  |\n| `traits.lastName`  <br>`traits.lastname`  <br>`traits.last_name`  <br>`context.traits.lastName`  <br>`context.traits.lastname`  <br>`context.traits.last_name` | `ln` | \\-  |\n| `traits.address.city`  <br>`context.traits.address.city` | `ct` | \\-  |\n| `traits.state`  <br>`context.traits.state` | `st` | \\-  |\n| `traits.zip`  <br>`traits.zipcode`  <br>`traits.zip_code`  <br>`traits.zipCode`  <br>`traits.postalcode`  <br>`traits.postal_code`  <br>`traits.postalCode`  <br>`traits.address.zipcode`  <br>`traits.address.zip_code` | `zip` | \\-  |\n| `traits.country`  <br>`context.traits.country` | `country` | \\-  |\n| `context.device.advertisingId` | `madid` | \\-  |\n| `context.userAgent` | `client_user_agent` | \\-  |\n| `traits.action_source`  <br>`context.traits.action_source`  <br>`properties.action_source` | `action_source` | \\-  |\n| `context.page.url`  <br>`properties.url` | `event_source_url` | \\-  |\n| `context.fbc` | `fbc` | \\-  |\n| `context.fbp` | `fbp` | \\-  |\n\nNote the following important points while sending event data to Facebook Offline Conversions:\n\n*   At least one [`match_key`](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/offline-conversions/#:~:text=one%20API%20call.-,Match%20Keys,-match_keys%20is%20a) is required to send an event successfully. RudderStack uses SHA256 encoding to hash all `match_keys` that include personally identifiable data in compliance with Facebook’s privacy requirements.\n*   If you send a `products` array using the `properties` object, RudderStack sends only the `id`, `quantity`, `brand`, `category`, and `price` properties for each product. The reason is that Facebook throws an error on encountering any property apart from these.\n*   If you send an event name as **Product List Viewed**, the value of [`content_type`](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/meta-pixel/get-started/advantage-catalog-ads#content-type) key is set as `product_group` otherwise, it is set as `product`.\n*   RudderStack sends a conversion event as long as it contains a `userId`. However, it is recommended to send as much user data through `context.traits` for better attribution results.\n*   You can send either the `firstName` and `lastName` separately or just the `name` property. RudderStack maps it to `fn` and `ln` on its own.\n\n## Sending custom `content_type`\n\nYou can either send the custom [`content_type`](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/meta-pixel/get-started/advantage-catalog-ads#content-type) by specifying it in the **Map Categories to Facebook Content Types** dashboard setting or via the `integrations` object:\n\n```\n\"integrations\": {\n  \"FacebookOfflineConversions\": {\n    \"contentType\": \"sending dedicated content type for this particular payload\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe priority order of setting the `content_type` value is as follows:\n\n1.  `content_type` provided in the `integrations` object is given the highest priority.\n2.  `content_type` provided in the RudderStack dashboard is given the second highest priority.\n3.  If none of the above is provided, the `content_type` is set to `product` by default, except in the following cases:\n\n*   If **Product List Viewed** event is sent:\n    *   with `products` array, then the `content_type` is set to `product`.\n    *   without the `products` array, then the `content_type` is set to `product_group`.\n*   If **Product Viewed** event is mapped in the RudderStack dashboard, then the `content_type` is set to `product`.\n*   If **Product Viewed** event is not mapped in RudderStack dashboard (default mapping is set to **View Content** event) and is sent:\n    *   with `products` array, then the `content_type` is set to `product`.\n    *   without the `products` array, then the `content_type` is set to `product_group`.\n*   If any other event is mapped to the Facebook standard event **View Content** in the RudderStack dashboard and is sent:\n    *   with `products` array, then the `content_type` is set to `product`.\n    *   without the `products` array, then the `content_type` is set to `product_group`.\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### Where can I find the System User Access Token?\n\n1.

To do so, you need to enable the **Enable Advanced Matching** setting in the RudderStack dashboard.\n\nThe following snippet highlights the use of the `identify` call:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify(\"userId\", userVars) // userVars is a JSON object\n```\n\n## Page\n\nWhen you make the `page` call, RudderStack sends the data to Facebook Pixel with the event type as `pageView`. You can also pass properties to `page` - RudderStack automatically sends these properties along with the event ID to Pixel.\n\nA sample `page` call is as shown:\n\n## Track\n\nThe `track` call lets you track custom events as they occur in your web application.\n\nA sample call looks like the following code snippet:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"Product Added\", {\n  order_ID: \"123\",\n  category: \"boots\",\n  product_name: \"yellow_cowboy_boots\",\n  price: 99.95,\n  currency: \"EUR\",\n  revenue: 2000,\n  value: 3000,\n  checkinDate: \"Thu Mar 24 2018 17:46:45 GMT+0000 (UTC)\",\n})\n```\n\nIn addition to the above call, a `contentType` in the integrations options can be available. If present, it will precede the default value or dashboard settings of `contentType`.\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\n  \"Product Added\",\n  {\n    order_ID: \"123\",\n    category: \"boots\",\n    product_name: \"yellow_cowboy_boots\",\n    price: 99.95,\n    currency: \"EUR\",\n    revenue: 2000,\n    value: 3000,\n    checkinDate: \"Thu Mar 24 2018 17:46:45 GMT+0000 (UTC)\",\n  },\n  {\n    \"Facebook Pixel\": { contentType: \"mycustomtype\" },\n  }\n)\n```\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> String is the only valid data type for the `category` field. However, you can pass an array of string values which will be concatenated using a delimiter (,) before sending the events.\n\n## Standard events\n\nRudderStack maps the event name in the payload to the Facebook standard event before sending it to Facebook Pixel. The properties are sent as the standard events require them. Refer to the [Ecommerce Events Specification](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/ecommerce-events-spec/) for more information.\n\nRudderStack maps the following events to the Facebook standard events by default:\n\n| RudderStack Event | Facebook Standard Event |\n| --- | --- |\n| `Product List Viewed` | `ViewContent` |\n| `Product Viewed` | `ViewContent` |\n| `Product Added` | `AddToCart` |\n| `Order Completed` | `Purchase` |\n| `Products Searched` | `Search` |\n| `Checkout Started` | `InitiateCheckout` |\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> You can use the **Map your events with Facebook Standard Events** setting in the RudderStack dashboard to override the default mappings specified in the table above.\n\nNote that:\n\n*   For the `Purchase` standard event (mapped to `Order Completed` event), `properties.revenue` is a required field. Also, RudderStack sends the `delivery_category` field along with `id`, `item_price` and `quantity`.\n    \n*   For the `Products Searched` event, the `query` property must be a string.\n    \n*   If you map an event with the `ViewContent` standard event using the RudderStack dashboard setting and don’t send the `products` array in the `message.properties` object:\n    \n    ```\n    \"properties\": {\n      \"phone\": 1-202-555-0146,\n      \"email\": \"alex@example.com\",\n      \"category\": \"clothing\",\n      \"list_id\": \"1234\",\n      \"testDimension\": true,\n      \"testMetric\": true\n    }\n    ```\n    \n    Then, `content_ids` is mapped to `properties.category` value (`clothing` in this case) and `quantity` is set to `1` inside the `contents` object.\n    \n\nThe below table elaborates the property mappings between RudderStack and Facebook corresponding to the RudderStack event:\n\n| RudderStack event | RudderStack property | Facebook property |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Product List Viewed |\n| `products.$.product_id/products.$.sku/products.$.id` | `content_ids` |\n| `category`  <br>`contentName`  <br>`currency`  <br>`value` | `content_category`  <br>`content_name`  <br>`currency`  <br>`value` |\n| `products.$.product_id/products.$.sku/products.$.id`  <br>`products.$.quantity/quantity`  <br>`product.$.price` | `contents.id`  <br>`contents.quantity`  <br>`contents.item_price` |\n| Product Viewed |\n| `product_id/sku/id`  <br>`product_name/name`  <br>`category`  <br>`currency` | `content_ids`  <br>`content_name`  <br>`content_category`  <br>`currency` |\n| `product_id/sku/id`  <br>`quantity`  <br>`price` | `contents.id`  <br>`contents.quantity`  <br>`contents.item_price` |\n| Product Added |\n| `product_id/sku/id`  <br>`product_name/name`  <br>`currency` | `content_ids`  <br>`content_name`  <br>`currency` |\n| `product_id/sku/id`  <br>`quantity`  <br>`price` | `contents.id`  <br>`contents.quantity`  <br>`contents.item_price` |\n| Order Completed |\n| `products.$.product_id/products.$.sku/products.$.id` | `content_ids` |\n| `contentName`  <br>`currency`  <br>`revenue` | `content_name`  <br>`currency`  <br>`value` |\n| `products.$.delivery_category`/`properties.delivery_category`  <br>`products.$.product_id/products.$.sku/products.$.id`  <br>`products.$.quantity/quantity`  <br>`product.$.price/price` | `contents.delivery_category`  <br>`contents.id`  <br>`contents.quantity`  <br>`contents.item_price` |\n| Products Searched | `query`  <br>`product_id/sku/id`  <br>`category`  <br>`currency`  <br>`value` | `search_string`  <br>`content_ids`  <br>`content_category`  <br>`currency`  <br>`value` |\n| `product_id/sku/id`  <br>`quantity`  <br>`price` | `contents.id`  <br>`contents.quantity`  <br>`contents.item_price` |\n| Checkout Started |\n| `products.$.product_id/products.$.sku/products.$.id` | `content_ids` |\n| `category`  <br>`currency`  <br>`revenue` | `content_category`  <br>`currency`  <br>`value` |\n| `pproducts.$.product_id/products.$.sku/products.$.id`  <br>`products.$.quantity/quantity`  <br>`product.$.price/price` | `contents.id`  <br>`contents.quantity`  <br>`contents.item_price` |\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> In the above table, the default values for the `currency` and `quantity` properties are `USD` and `1` respectively.\n\n### Other standard events\n\nIf you map your event to any of the following Facebook standard events, then RudderStack treats it as a standard event as well:\n\n*   `AddToWishlist`\n*   `AddPaymentInfo`\n*   `Lead`\n*   `CompleteRegistration`\n*   `Contact`\n*   `CustomizeProduct`\n*   `Donate`\n*   `FindLocation`\n*   `Schedule`\n*   `StartTrial`\n*   `SubmitApplication`\n*   `Subscribe`\n\nFor any properties you want to send with these events, you must specify them in the **Standard Events custom properties** settings field.\n\n## Custom events\n\nCustom events are used to send any event that does not appear in any of the mappings.\n\n## Deduplication\n\nFacebook Pixel allows you to send events via your web browser and your server via the Conversion API. Depending on how you send your events, with this duel set-up, redundant events may be received by Facebook. Therefore, to help get accurate representation of your data, Facebook tries to [deduplicate events](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/823677331451951?id=1205376682832142) coming in.\n\n#### `event_id` method (Recommended)\n\nFacebook’s (and RudderStack’s) recommended form of deduplication is to leverage the `event_name` and `event_id` properties. When two events coming into Facebook meet the following criteria, they will be deduplicated.\n\n*   They are sent within 48 hours of each other\n*   They are received by the same Facebook Pixel ID\n*   They have the same `event_name` i.e. `Purchase` etc.\n*   They have the same `event_id`\n    *   The `event_id` must be unique to that specific event and the same for both of the events coming from the Pixel and Conversion API\n    *   For example: the `event_id` could be the purchase order number etc.\n\nYou can set the `event_id` in `traits` , `context.traits` or `properties` object as a unique identifier.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> If you don’t set the `event_id`, RudderStack will use `messageId` to map to Facebook’s `eventId`.\n\nThe `event_name` will be picked up from the name of the event. For more information regarding the logic behind the `event_id` deduplication, refer to the [Facebook documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/conversions-api/deduplicate-pixel-and-server-events/#event-id-and-event-name---recommended).\n\n#### `fbp` and `external_id` method (Not Recommended)\n\nFor this approach, it is necessary to send an event, first from the browser, then from the server. Both events must have the same `event_name`, and the same `fbp` parameter and the same `external_id`. If the browser event is received before the server event and both events have the same `event_name` and the same `fbp` and `external_id`, then the server event will be discarded. Below are a few shortcomings for this deduplication method.\n\n*   It will always discard the server event is Facebook identifies a redundant event.\n*   This method only works for deduplicating events sent first from the browser and then the server.\n*   There will be no deduplication if two consecutive browser events with the same information are sent to Facebook. The same is true if two server events with the same information is sent to Facebook\n\nRudderStack maps the `event_name` from whatever the name of the event that is being sent is. The `fbp` parameter is taken from the `context.fbp` key-value pair. Finally, the `external_id` will just be the `userId` or `anonymousId` (if `userId` is not present).\n\nFor more information regarding the logic behind the `fbp` and `external_id` deduplication, refer to the [Facebook documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/conversions-api/deduplicate-pixel-and-server-events/#fbp-or-external-id).\n\n## Sending custom `content_type`\n\nYou can send a custom [`content_type`](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/meta-pixel/get-started/advantage-catalog-ads#content-type) field by specifying it in the `properties.content_type` field of your event.\n\nRudderStack sets the value of `content_type` in the following priority order:\n\n1.  It gives the highest priority to `properties.content_type` in your event.\n2.  If `properties.content_type` is absent, RudderStack sets the `content_type` to `product` by default, except in the following cases:\n\n*   If **Product List Viewed** event is sent:\n    *   with `products` array, then the `content_type` is set to `product`.\n    *   without the `products` array, then the `content_type` is set to `product_group`.\n*   If **Product Viewed** event is not mapped in RudderStack dashboard (default mapping is set to **View Content** event) but is sent:\n    *   with `products` array, then the `content_type` is set to `product`.\n    *   without the `products` array, then the `content_type` is set to `product_group`.\n*   If any other event is mapped to the Facebook standard event **View Content** in the RudderStack dashboard and is sent:\n    *   with `products` array, then the `content_type` is set to `product`.\n    *   without the `products` array, then the `content_type` is set to `product_group`.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> `product` and `product_group` are the only two acceptable values for `content_type`.\n\nQuestions?

Otherwise, RudderStack creates a new user in Freshmarketer.\n\nA sample `identify` call is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify(\"1hKOmRA4GRlm\", {\n  email: \"alex@example.com\",\n  firstName: \"Alex\",\n  lastName: \"Keener\",\n  state: \"Louisiana\",\n  country: \"USA\",\n  postalCode: \"90009\",\n});\n```\n\nThe following table lists the mappings between the RudderStack and Freshmarketer properties:\n\n| RudderStack property | Freshmarketer property |\n| --- | --- |\n| `traits.email`  <br>`context.traits.email`  <br>Required | `emails` |\n| `traits.firstname`  <br>`traits.first_name`  <br>`traits.firstName`<br><br>`context.traits.firstname`  <br>`context.traits.first_name`  <br>`context.traits.firstName` | `first_name` |\n| `traits.lastname`  <br>`traits.last_name`  <br>`traits.lastName`<br><br>`context.traits.lastname`  <br>`context.traits.last_name`  <br>`context.traits.lastName` | `last_name` |\n| `traits.subscriptionStatus`  <br>`context.traits.subscriptionStatus` | `subscription_status` |\n| `traits.job_title`  <br>`traits.jobTitle`  <br>`context.traits.job_title`  <br>`context.traits.jobTitle` | `job_title` |\n| `traits.phone`  <br>`context.traits.phone` | `work_number` |\n| `userId` | `external_id` |\n| `traits.mobileNumber`  <br>`context.traits.mobileNumber` | `mobile_number` |\n| `traits.address`  <br>`context.traits.address` | `address` |\n| `traits.address.city`  <br>`traits.city`  <br>`context.traits.address.city`  <br>`context.traits.city` | `city` |\n| `traits.address.state`  <br>`traits.state`  <br>`context.traits.address.state`  <br>`context.traits.state` | `state` |\n| `traits.address.postalCode`  <br>`traits.zip`  <br>`traits.zipcode`  <br>`context.traits.zip`  <br>`context.traits.zipcode`  <br>`context.traits.address.postalCode` | `zipcode` |\n| `traits.address.country`  <br>`traits.country`  <br>`context.traits.address.country`  <br>`context.traits.country` | `country` |\n| `traits.salesAccounts`  <br>`context.traits.salesAccounts` | `sales_accounts` |\n| `traits.territoryId`  <br>`context.traits.territoryId` | `territory_id` |\n| `traits.leadSourceId`  <br>`context.traits.leadSourceId` | `lead_source_id` |\n| `traits.ownerId`  <br>`context.traits.ownerId` | `owner_id` |\n| `traits.subscriptionTypes`  <br>`context.traits.subscriptionTypes` | `subscription_types` |\n| `traits.medium`  <br>`context.traits.medium` | `medium` |\n| `traits.campaignId`  <br>`traits.campaign_id`  <br>`context.traits.campaignId`  <br>`context.traits.campaign_id`  <br>`context.campaign.name` | `campaign_id` |\n| `traits.keyword`  <br>`context.traits.keyword`  <br>`context.campaign.term` | `keyword` |\n| `traits.timeZone`  <br>`context.traits.timeZone` | `time_zone` |\n| `traits.facebookUserName`  <br>`context.traits.facebookUserName` | `facebook` |\n| `traits.twitterUserName`  <br>`context.traits.twitterUserName` | `twitter` |\n| `traits.linkedinUserName`  <br>`context.traits.linkedinUserName` | `linkedin` |\n| `createdAt` | `created_at` |\n| `timestamp` | `updated_at` |\n| `traits.contactStatusId`  <br>`context.traits.contactStatusId` | `contact_status_id` |\n| `traits.salesAccountId`  <br>`context.traits.salesAccountId` | `sales_account_id` |\n| `traits.lifecycleStageId`  <br>`context.traits.lifecycleStageId` | `lifecycle_stage_id` |\n\n## Track\n\nYou can use the RudderStack [`track`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/track/) call to track the user activities in Freshmarketer.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> To make a `track` call successfully, you must map the event to be sent in the `track` call in the **Map your events with Freshmarketer Standard Events** dashboard setting.\n\nRudderStack supports the following `track` events:\n\n### Lifecycle stage\n\nLifecycle stage events capture the decision journey of a customer. Refer to the [Freshsales documentation](https://support.freshsales.io/en/support/solutions/articles/50000003344-how-to-manage-lifecycle-stages-and-status-for-contacts-) to create lifecycle stages in Freshmarketer.\n\nRudderStack lets you update the status of a contact in their lifecycle stage by using either the `lifecycleStageId` or `lifecycleStageName`.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> `lifecycleStageName` is a case-sensitive field and throws an error if not used in the intended manner.\n\nA sample `track` call for a lifecycle stage event is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"eventName\", {\n  email: \"alex@example.com\",\n  lifecycleStageId: 71010794467,\n  phone: \"+1-202-555-0146\",\n  owner_id: \"70000090119\",\n});\n```\n\nThe following table lists the property mappings betweeen RudderStack and Freshmarketer for lifecycle stage events:\n\n| RudderStack property | Freshmarketer property |\n| --- | --- |\n| `email`  <br>Required | `email` |\n| `lifecycleStageName`  <br>Required, if lifecycleStageId is absent. | `lifecycleStageName` |\n| `lifecycleStageId`  <br>Required, if lifecycleStageName is absent. | `lifecycle_stage_id` |\n\n### Sales activities\n\n[Sales activities](https://developers.freshworks.com/crm/api/#sales-activities) events can be used to track any activity related to a contact/deal/account. Refer to the [Freshsales documentation](https://support.freshsales.io/en/support/solutions/articles/230199-how-to-configure-different-sales-activities-in-freshsales-) to create sales activities in Freshmarketer.\n\nRudderStack lets you create the status of a contact by using either the `salesActivityTypeId` or `salesActivityName`.\n\nA sample `track` call for a sales activity event is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"eventName\", {\n  salesActivityTypeId: \"70000663932\",\n  title: \"new contact\",\n  startDate: \"2021-05-04T17:00:00+05:30\",\n  endDate: \"2022-06-04T17:30:00+05:30\",targetable_type\n  ownerId: \"70054866612\",\n});\n```\n\nThe following table lists the property mappings betweeen RudderStack and Freshmarketer for sales activity events:\n\n| RudderStack property | Freshmarketer property |\n| --- | --- |\n| `properties.title`  <br>Required | `title` |\n| `properties.salesActivityName`  <br>Required, if properties.salesActivityTypeId is absent. | `sales_activity_name` |\n| `properties.salesActivityTypeId`  <br>Required, if properties.salesActivityName is absent. | `sales_activity_type_id` |\n| `properties.startDate`  <br>Required | `start_date` |\n| `properties.endDate`  <br>Required | `end_date` |\n| `context.externalId.type`  <br>Required | `targetable_type` |\n| `properties.ownerId`  <br>Required | `owner_id` |\n| `salesActivityOutcomeId` | `sales_activity_outcome_id` |\n| `properties.notes` | `notes` |\n| `context.externalId.id` | `targetable_id` |\n| `properties.createrId` | `creater_id` |\n| `originalTimestamp` | `created_at` |\n| `timestamp` | `updated_at` |\n| `properties.location` | `location` |\n| `latitude`  <br>`context.address.latitude`  <br>`context.location.latitude` | `latitude` |\n| `longitude`  <br>`context.address.longitude`  <br>`context.location.longitude` | `longitude` |\n| `properties.checkedinAt` | `checkedin_at` |\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> The `targetable_type` field denotes the entity for which the sales activity has been created and can take `Contact`/`SalesAccount`/`Deal` as its value. However, if its value is set to `contact`, then either the `targetable_id` or `email` is required.\n\n## Group\n\nThe [`group`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/group/) call lets you link an identified Freshmarketer contact with a company, organization, or an account. You can also record any custom group traits like the company name, number of employees, etc.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> To make a `group` call successfully, you must pass the `groupType` field with value as `accounts` or `marketing_lists`.\n\n### Accounts\n\nRudderStack uses the [Upsert an Account](https://developers.freshworks.com/crm/api/#upsert_an_account) API to create or update a [sales account](https://developers.freshworks.com/crm/api/#accounts) via the following parameters:\n\n| Attribute | Type | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `unique_identifier` | String | RudderStack passes the account `name`. |\n| `sales_account` | Hashed Object | RudderStack passes the other relevant details associated with the Freshmarketer account. |\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Note that:\n> \n> *   If `name` already exists, RudderStack updates the Freshmarketer account details. Otherwise, it creates a new account in Freshmarketer.\n> *   RudderStack also checks if the contact’s `email` is present in the `context.traits` object. If yes, RudderStack links the contact to the Freshmarketer account.\n\nA sample `group` call is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.group(\n  \"group01\", {\n    groupType: \"accounts\",\n    name: \"Alex Keener\",\n    phone: \"1234567890\",\n    numberOfEmployees: 51,\n    annualRevenue: 10000,\n    zipcode: 90009,\n    street: \"6649 N Blue Gum Street\",\n    city: \"New Orleans\",\n    state: \"Louisiana\",\n    country: \"USA\"\n  }, {\n    context: {\n      traits: {\n        email: \"alex@example.com\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n);\n```\n\nThe following table lists the mappings between the RudderStack and Freshmarketer properties to create or update an account:\n\n| RudderStack property | Freshmarketer property |\n| --- | --- |\n| `name`  <br>Required | `name` |\n| `traits.industryTypeId`  <br>`context.traits.industryTypeId` | `industry_type_id` |\n| `traits.businessTypeId`  <br>`context.traits.businessTypeId`  <br>`traits.business_type_id`  <br>`context.traits.business_type_id` | `business_type_id` |\n| `phone` | `phone` |\n| `traits.numberOfEmployees`  <br>`context.traits.numberOfEmployees` | `number_of_employees` |\n| `traits.annualRevenue`  <br>`context.traits.annualRevenue` | `annual_revenue` |\n| `traits.address`  <br>`context.traits.address` | `address` |\n| `traits.city`  <br>`traits.address.city`  <br>`context.traits.city`  <br>`context.traits.address.city` | `city` |\n| `traits.state`  <br>`traits.address.state`  <br>`context.traits.state`  <br>`context.traits.address.state` | `state` |\n| `traits.country`  <br>`traits.address.country`  <br>`context.traits.country`  <br>`context.traits.address.country` | `country` |\n| `zipcode` | `zipcode` |\n| `traits.website`  <br>`context.traits.website` | `website` |\n| `traits.territoryId`  <br>`context.traits.territoryId` | `territory_id` |\n| `traits.parentSalesAccountid`  <br>`context.traits.parentSalesAccountid` | `parent_sales_account_id` |\n| `traits.ownerId`  <br>`context.traits.ownerId` | `ownerId` |\n| `traits.facebookUserName`  <br>`context.traits.facebookUserName` | `facebook` |\n| `traits.twitterUserName`  <br>`context.traits.twitterUserName` | `twitter` |\n| `traits.linkedinUserName`  <br>`context.traits.linkedinUserName` | `linkedin` |\n| `createdAt` | `created_at` |\n| `timestamp` | `updated_at` |\n\n### Marketing lists\n\n[Marketing lists](https://developers.freshworks.com/crm/api/#marketing-lists) help you group contacts into lists which you can quickly invoke for marketing campaigns and bulk emailing.\n\nRudderStack lets you add one or more contacts to a specified marketing list. To do so, you need to provide the contact’s `email` and `listId`/`listName`. Also, RudderStack creates a new marketing list if the `listName` (case-sensitive) does not exist already.\n\nA sample `group` call to add a contact to a marketing list is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.group(\"group01\", {\n  groupType: \"marketing_lists\",\n  email: \"alex@example.com\",\n  listName: \"listIdX123\",\n});\n```\n\nThe following table lists the property mappings between RudderStack and Freshmarketer to create marketing lists:\n\n| RudderStack property | Freshmarketer property |\n| --- | --- |\n| `email`  <br>Required | `email` |\n| `listId`  <br>Required, if listName is absent. | `listId` |\n| `listName`  <br>Required, if listId is absent. | `listName` |\n\n## Type conversion and invalid format error\n\nThe following event properties accept only the number data type:\n\n*   `territoryId`\n*   `leadSourceId`\n*   `ownerId`\n*   `campaignId`\n*   `contactStatusId`\n*   `lifecycleStageId`\n*   `industryTypeId`\n*   `businessTypeId`\n*   `numberOfEmployees`\n*   `parentSalesAccountid`\n\nIf any of the above properties are present in any `identify` or `group` call in a different format, RudderStack will try to convert them into the number data type. If the type conversion is unsuccessful, RudderStack will give an “invalid format” error.\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### Where can I find the Freshmarketer API key?\n\nTo obtain your Freshmarketer API key, follow these steps:\n\n1.

    "markdown": "# Firebase | RudderStack Docs\n\nSend your event data from RudderStack to Firebase.\n\n* * *\n\n*     9 minute read  \n    \n\n[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) is a popular mobile platform powered by Google. It helps you to quickly develop high-quality, enterprise-grade applications and grow your business.\n\nRudderStack supports Firebase as a [mobile device mode](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#device-mode) to which you can seamlessly send your customer data for analytics.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> Firebase device mode support is not available for the [Cordova](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-cordova-sdk/) SDK.\n\n## Getting started\n\nBefore configuring Firebase as a destination in RudderStack, verify if the source platform is supported by Firebase by referring to the table below:\n\n| **Connection Mode** | **Web** | **Mobile** | **Server** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Device mode** | \\-  | **Supported** | \\-  |\n| **Cloud mode** | \\-  | \\-  | \\-  |\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Firebase is a device mode-only integration. To learn more about the difference between cloud mode and device mode in RudderStack, refer to the [RudderStack Connection Modes](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/) guide.\n\nOnce you have confirmed that the source platform supports sending events to Firebase, follow these steps:\n\n1.  From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add a source. Then, from the list of destinations, select **Firebase**.\n2.  Assign a name to the destination and click **Next**.\n\n### Connection settings\n\nConnect this destination to your Android/iOS/Unity/React Native source. You should then see the following screen:\n\n[![Firebase connection settings](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/firebase-connection-settings.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/firebase-connection-settings.webp)\n\n*   **Client-side Events Filtering**: Refer to the [Client-side Event Filtering](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/event-filtering/) guide for more information on this setting.\n\nAs this is a device mode-only integration, click **Next** to complete the destination setup.\n\n### Adding device mode integration\n\nDepending on your platform of integration, follow the steps below to add Firebase to your project:\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Use the [latest version](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.rudderstack.android.integration/firebase) of the Firebase Android device mode to get the latest updates, bug fixes, and performance enhancements.\n\nFollow these steps to add Firebase to your Android project:\n\n1.  Register your mobile app in the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).\n2.  Once you have successfully created the app in the Firebase console, you will be prompted to download the `google-services.json` file.\n3.  Copy this file in the `app` folder of your project. It contains all necessary information about the project and the integration.\n4.  Add the `classpath` under `dependencies` to your project level `build.gradle`:\n\n```\nbuildscript {\n  repositories {\n    google()\n  }\n  dependencies {\n    // add this line\n    classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:4.3.3'\n  }\n}\n```\n\n5.  Now, you can add the `plugins` and `dependencies` to your `app/build.gradle` file:\n\n```\napply plugin: 'com.android.application'\napply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'\n```\n\n6.  Then, add the `mavenCentral` repository:\n\n```\nrepositories {\n  mavenCentral()\n}\n```\n\n7.  Add the RudderStack-Firebase SDK extension along with the `core` SDK under `dependencies`:\n\n```\nimplementation 'com.rudderstack.android.sdk:core:1.+'\nimplementation 'com.rudderstack.android.integration:firebase:2.+'\n\n//Firebase\nimplementation platform('com.google.firebase:firebase-bom:28.4.2')\nimplementation 'com.google.firebase:firebase-analytics'\n```\n\n8.  Next, add the necessary `permissions` under `AndroidManifest.xml`:\n\n```\n<uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.INTERNET\"></uses-permission>\n<uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE\"></uses-permission>\n```\n\n9.  Finally, change the SDK initialization in your `Application` class:\n\n```\n// initialize Rudder SDK\nval rudderClient =\n    RudderClient.getInstance(\n        this,\n        WRITE_KEY,\n        RudderConfig.Builder()\n            .withDataPlaneUrl(DATA_PLANE_URL)\n            .withFactory(FirebaseIntegrationFactory.FACTORY)\n            .build()\n    )\n```\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> If you’re using the Firebase iOS device mode v1.0.2, update to the [latest version](https://cocoapods.org/pods/Rudder-Firebase) to get the latest updates, bug fixes, and performance enhancements.\n\nFollow these steps to add Firebase to your iOS project:\n\n1.  Register your app in the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/). It will then prompt you to download the `GoogleServices-Info.plist` file.\n2.  Add the file to the root of your XCode project.\n3.  Go to your `Podfile` and add the `Rudder-Firebase` extension along with the core SDK using the following code:\n\n```\npod 'Rudder-Firebase', '~> 2.0.5'\n```\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> `Rudder-Firebase` version `2.0.5` is tested and fully compatible with `Firebase/Analytics` version `8.15.0`.\n\n4\\. After adding the dependency followed by the \\`pod install\\` command, you can add the imports to your \\`AppDelegate.m\\` file:\n\n```\n#import \"RudderFirebaseFactory.h\"\n```\n\n5.  Finally, change the SDK initialization, as shown in the following snippet:\n\n```\nRSConfigBuilder *builder = [[RSConfigBuilder alloc] init];\n[builder withDataPlaneUrl:<data_plane_url>];\n[builder withFactory:[RudderFirebaseFactory instance]];\n[builder withLoglevel:RSLogLevelDebug];\n[RSClient getInstance:<write_key> config:[builder build]];\n```\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> This device mode integration is supported for Firebase v8.15.0 and above.\n\nFollow these steps to add Firebase to your iOS project:\n\n1.  Add Firebase as a destination in the [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/).\n2.  Register your app in the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/). It will then prompt you to download the `GoogleServices-Info.plist` file.\n3.  Download and place this file in your project.\n4.  Install `RudderFirebase` (available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/)) by adding the following line to your `Podfile`:\n\n```\npod 'RudderFirebase', '~> 1.0.0'\n```\n\n5.  Run the `pod install` command.\n6.  Then, import the SDK depending on your preferred platform:\n\n7.  Next, add the imports to your `AppDelegate` file under the `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` method:\n\n```\nRSConfig *config = [[RSConfig alloc] initWithWriteKey:WRITE_KEY];\n[config dataPlaneURL:DATA_PLANE_URL];\n[[RSClient sharedInstance] configureWith:config];\n[[RSClient sharedInstance] addDestination:[[RudderFirebaseDestination alloc] init]];\n```\n\n```\nlet config: RSConfig = RSConfig(writeKey: WRITE_KEY)\n            .dataPlaneURL(DATA_PLANE_URL)\nRSClient.sharedInstance().configure(with: config)\nRSClient.sharedInstance().addDestination(RudderFirebaseDestination())\n```\n\nFollow these steps to add Firebase to your Unity project:\n\n1.  Register your project in the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/). Currently, RudderStack supports only Android and iOS platforms for Unity.\n2.  After adding the project, Firebase will prompt you to download the `google-services.json` for Android and `GoogleServices-Info.plist` for iOS.\n3.  Add those two files to your project’s `Assets` folder.\n4.  Integrate the RudderStack core SDK with your project. For more information, refer to the [Unity SDK documentation](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-unity-sdk/).\n5.  Download and import the Firebase Unity SDK and follow the [instructions](https://firebase.google.com/docs/unity/setup) to add the Firebase SDK (specifically, `FirebaseAnalytics.unitypackage`) to your project.\n6.  Download the [RudderStack Firebase Extension](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-sdk-unity/raw/master/Integrations/Firebase/rudder-integration-firebase-unity.unitypackage) from the GitHub page and import it in your project.\n7.  Attach the `RudderPreferbs.prefab` file from `Rudder` to your main `GameObject`\n8.  Finally, change the SDK initialization using the following code snippet:\n\n```\n\n// Build your config\nRudderConfigBuilder configBuilder = new RudderConfigBuilder()\n    .WithEndPointUrl(<data_plane_url>)\n    .WithFactory(RudderFirebaseIntegrationFactory.GetFactory());\n\n// get instance for RudderClient\nRudderClient rudderClient = RudderClient.GetInstance(\n    <source_write_key>,\n    configBuilder.Build()\n);\n```\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Use the [latest version](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rudderstack/rudder-integration-firebase-react-native) of the Firebase React Native device mode to get the latest updates and performance enhancements.\n\nFollow these steps to add Firebase to your React Native project:\n\n1.  Register your Android and iOS applications in the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).\n2.  Once you have successfully created the applications in the Firebase console, you will be prompted to download the `google-services.json` and `GoogleServices-Info.plist` files.\n3.  Add the RudderStack React Native SDK to your app by referring to the [React Native SDK documentation](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-react-native-sdk/).\n4.  Add the RudderStack-Firebase React Native module to your app using the following command:\n\n```\nnpm install @rudderstack/rudder-integration-firebase-react-native\n// OR //\nyarn add @rudderstack/rudder-integration-firebase-react-native\n```\n\n5.  Next, import the module you added above and add it to your SDK initialization code as shown:\n\n```\nimport rudderClient from '@rudderstack/rudder-sdk-react-native';\nimport firebase from \"@rudderstack/rudder-integration-firebase-react-native\";\n\nconst config = {\n    dataPlaneUrl: <data_plane_url>,\n    trackAppLifecycleEvents: true,\n    withFactories: [firebase]\n};\n\nrudderClient.setup(<source_write_key>, config);\n```\n\n6.  Navigate to your app’s `android` folder and follow the steps below:\n\n*   Copy the `google-services.json` file in the `app` folder of your Android project. This file contains all necessary information about the project and the integration.\n*   Add the `classpath` under `dependencies` to your project level `build.gradle` file:\n\n```\nbuildscript {\n  repositories {\n    google()\n  }\n  dependencies {\n    // add this line\n    classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:4.3.3'\n  }\n}\n```\n\n*   Once you have completed the steps above, you can add the plugins and dependencies to your `app/build.gradle` file:\n\n```\napply plugin: 'com.android.application'\napply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'\n```\n\n*   Then, add the necessary permissions under `AndroidManifest.xml`:\n\n```\n<uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.INTERNET\"></uses-permission>\n<uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE\"></uses-permission>\n```\n\n7.  For React-Native Firebase version 1.0.16 and above, if you encounter any static libraries issue while installing the Rudder-Firebase pods, add the below lines in your iOS app’s `Podfile`:\n\n```\npod 'FirebaseCore', :modular_headers => true\npod 'GoogleUtilities', :modular_headers => true\n```\n\n8.  Finally, navigate to your app’s `iOS` folder and follow these steps:\n\n*   Install all required pods using the `pod install` command.\n*   Add the `GoogleServices-Info.plist` file to the root of your XCode project.\n\nFollow the below steps to add Firebase to your Flutter Project:\n\n1.  Add the following dependency to the `dependencies` section of your `pubspec.yaml` file.\n\n```\nrudder_integration_firebase_flutter: ^1.0.1\n```\n\n2.  Run the below command to install the dependency added in the above step:\n\n3.  Import the `RudderIntegrationFirebaseFlutter` in your application where you are initializing the SDK.\n\n```\nimport 'package:rudder_integration_firebase_flutter/rudder_integration_firebase_flutter.dart';\n```\n\n4.  Change the initialization of your `RudderClient` as shown:\n\n```\nfinal RudderController rudderClient = RudderController.instance;\nRudderConfigBuilder builder = RudderConfigBuilder();\nbuilder.withFactory(RudderIntegrationFirebaseFlutter());\nrudderClient.initialize(<write_key>, config: builder.build(), options: null);\n```\n\n5.  Navigate to your app’s `android` folder and follow the below steps:\n\n*   Copy the `google-services.json` file in the `app` folder of your Android project. This file contains all necessary information about the project and the integration.\n*   Add the `classpath` under `dependencies` to your project level `build.gradle` file:\n\n```\nbuildscript {\n  repositories {\n    google()\n  }\n  dependencies {\n    // add this line\n    classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:4.3.3'\n  }\n}\n```\n\n*   Add `mavenCentral()` as a repository under `buildscript.repositories` and `allprojects.repositories` to your project level `build.gradle` file:\n\n```\nbuildscript {\n  repositories {\n    google()\n    // should be added\n    mavenCentral()\n  }\n  dependencies {\n    classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:4.3.3'\n  }\n}\nallprojects {\n  repositories {\n      google()\n      // should be added\n      mavenCentral()\n  }\n}\n```\n\n*   Next, add the plugins and dependencies to your `app/build.gradle` file:\n\n```\napply plugin: 'com.android.application'\napply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'\n```\n\n*   Add the necessary permissions under `AndroidManifest.xml`:\n\n```\n<uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.INTERNET\"></uses-permission>\n<uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE\"></uses-permission>\n```\n\n6.  Finally, navigate to your app’s `iOS` folder and add the `GoogleServices-Info.plist` file to the root of your XCode project.\n\n## Identify\n\nThe [`identify`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/identify/) call sets the `userId` through the `setUserId` method from `FirebaseAnalytics`. RudderStack sets the other user properties from `RudderTraits` to Firebase using the `setUserProperty` method.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack ignores `age`, `gender`, and `interest`, as these properties are reserved by Google.\n\n```\n[[RSClient sharedInstance] identify:@\"test_user_id\"\n                             traits:@{@\"foo\": @\"bar\",\n                                      @\"foo1\": @\"bar1\",\n                                      @\"email\": @\"test@gmail.com\",\n                                      @\"key_1\" : @\"value_1\",\n                                      @\"key_2\" : @\"value_2\"\n                             }\n];\n```\n\n## Track\n\nRudderStack’s [`track`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/track/) events are mapped to the standard Firebase events wherever possible.\n\n### Event mapping\n\nRudderStack maps the following events to the standard Firebase events:\n\n| RudderStack Event | Firebase Event |\n| --- | --- |\n| `Payment Info Entered` | `add_payment_info` |\n| `Product Added` | `add_to_cart` |\n| `Product Added to Wishlist` | `add_to_wishlist` |\n| `Application Opened` | `app_open` |\n| `Checkout Started` | `begin_checkout` |\n| `Order Completed` | `purchase` |\n| `Order Refunded` | `refund` |\n| `Products Searched` | `search` |\n| `Cart Shared` | `share` |\n| `Product Shared` | `share` |\n| `Product Viewed` | `view_item` |\n| `Product List Viewed` | `view_item_list` |\n| `Product Removed` | `remove_from_cart` |\n| `Product Clicked` | `select_content` |\n| `Promotion Viewed` | `view_promotion` |\n| `Promotion Clicked` | `select_promotion` |\n| `Cart Viewed` | `view_cart` |\n\nThe following Firebase events are **not** mapped to any RudderStack event:\n\n*   `number_of_nights`\n*   `number_of_rooms`\n*   `number_of_passengers`\n*   `origin`\n*   `destination`\n*   `start_date`\n*   `end_date`\n*   `travel_class`\n*   `item_list_name`\n*   `creative_slot`\n*   `location_id`\n*   `transaction_id`\n*   `screen_class`\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack passes all event-related properties to Firebase. The nested values in the properties are converted to JSON using [GSON](https://github.com/google/gson).\n\n### Property mapping\n\nRudderStack maps the following event properties to the standard Firebase properties:\n\n| RudderStack property | Firebase property |\n| --- | --- |\n| `category` | `item_category` |\n| `cart_id`,`product_id` | `item_id` |\n| `share_via` | `method` |\n| `query` | `search_term` |\n| `revenue`, `value`, `total` | `value` |\n| `currency` | `currency` |\n| `tax` | `tax` |\n| `shipping` | `shipping` |\n| `coupon` | `coupon` |\n| `name` | `name`, `promotion_name` |\n| `quantity` | `quantity` |\n| `price` | `price` |\n| `payment_method` | `payment_type` |\n| `list_id` | `item_list_id` |\n| `promotion_id` | `promotion_id` |\n| `creative` | `creative_name` |\n| `affiliation` | `affiliation` |\n\nAlong with mapping the above list of the standard property names, RudderStack exhibits the following behavior:\n\n*   Converts the event names to the lower case.\n*   Trims the whitespaces at the start and the end.\n*   Replaces a space with an underscore.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Firebase enforces a [strict event name length limit](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/cpp/group/event-names#summary) of 40 characters. RudderStack takes a substring of 40 characters (from the beginning) if the event names exceed this permitted value.\n\nA sample `track` call sent from the iOS SDK is shown below:\n\n```\n[[RSClient sharedInstance] track:@\"simple_track_with_props\" properties:@{\n    @\"key_1\" : @\"value_1\",\n    @\"key_2\" : @\"value_2\"\n}];\n```\n\n## Screen\n\nThe [`screen`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/screen/) method lets you record whenever a user sees their mobile screen along with any optional properties about the viewed screen.\n\nA sample `screen` call is as shown:\n\n```\n[[RSClient sharedInstance] screen:@\"Home Screen\"\n                              properties:@{\n                                  @\"Width\" : @\"13\"\n                              }];\n```\n\n## Reset\n\nThe `reset` method resets the user identification.\n\nA sample `reset` call is shown below:\n\n```\n[[RSClient getInstance] reset];\n```\n\n```\nRudderClient.getInstance()?.reset()\n```\n\n## Debugging\n\nYou can check the events and their properties in the [Firebase DebugView](https://firebase.google.com/docs/analytics/debugview). To enable it for Android, run the following command from your terminal:\n\n```\n$ adb shell setprop debug.firebase.analytics.app <your_package_name>\n```\n\nFor iOS, specify the following in your command line argument in XCode:\n\n```\n-FIRAnalyticsDebugEnabled\n```\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### How do I disable automatic screen tracking while using the RudderStack SDKs?\n\n*   For Android, nest the following setting within the `<application>` tag of your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:\n\n```\n<meta-data android:name=\"google_analytics_automatic_screen_reporting_enabled\" android:value=\"false\" />\n```\n\n*   For iOS, set `FirebaseAutomaticScreenReportingEnabled` to `NO` (Boolean) in your `Info.plist`.\n\nFor more information, refer to the [Firebase documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/analytics/screenviews#automatically_track_screens).\n\nQuestions?

    "markdown": "# Gainsight PX Cloud Mode Integration\n\nSend events to Gainsight PX using RudderStack cloud mode.\n\n* * *\n\n*     3 minute read  \n    \n\nAfter you have successfully instrumented Gainsight PX as a destination in RudderStack, follow this guide to correctly send your events to Gainsight PX in [cloud mode](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#cloud-mode).\n\nFind the open source transformer code for this destination in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-transformer/tree/master/src/v0/destinations/gainsight_px).\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack requires the `userId` field for the `identify`, `group`, and `track` calls. If `userId` is absent, it uses `anonymousId` instead.\n\n## Identify\n\nRudderStack creates a `User` object in Gainsight PX when you make an [`identify`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/identify/) call. It maps the `userId` from the event to Gainsight’s `identifyId` (unique identifier for the `User` object). If `userId` is absent, RudderStack uses `anonymousId` instead.\n\nRudderStack supports all default attributes for the `User` object. You can map the custom atrributes in the RudderStack event to the Gainsight PX custom attributes using **User Attribute Mapping** dashboard setting:\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack drops any undefined custom attributes from the event and sends the rest of the attributes to Gainsight PX.\n\n[![](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/gainsightpx-identify-mapping.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/gainsightpx-identify-mapping.webp)\n\nA sample `identify` call is shown:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify(\"1hKOmRA4el9Z\", {\n  email: \"alex@example.com\",\n  name: \"Alex Keener\",\n  gender: \"Male\",\n  countryName: \"USA\",\n  countryCode: \"US\",\n  city: \"New Orleans\",\n  score: 100,\n  hobbyCustomField: \"Painting\",\n  title: \"Doctor\",\n})\n```\n\nIn the above example, `hobbyCustomField` is a custom field. You need to provide the mapping for `hobbyCustomField` to the corresponding custom attribute `hobby` [created in Gainsight PX](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/gainsight-px/setup-guide/#create-custom-attributes). If you do not provide this mapping, RudderStack drops the `hobbyCustomField` attribute and sends the other attributes to Gainsight PX.\n\n## Track\n\nRudderStack uses the Gainsight PX’s [Custom Event API](https://support.gainsight.com/PX/API_for_Developers/02Usage_of_Different_APIs/Use_Custom_Event_API) for sending the [`track`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/track/) events.\n\nA sample `track` call is shown:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"User Tracked\", {\n  description: \"Sample user tracking event\",\n  status: \"Demo\",\n})\n```\n\nRudderStack maps the event name to the `eventName` field in Gainsight PX.\n\n### Specify global context metadata\n\nYou can provide the [Global Context](https://support.gainsight.com/PX/Engagements/02Engagement_Configuration/Use_Global_Context) metadata by specifying the `globalContext` object in the `track` event as shown:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"User Tracked\", {\n  description: \"Sample user tracking event\",\n  status: \"Demo\",\n  globalContext: {\n    projectId: \"p-123\",\n  },\n})\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can set the global context for the `track` events by specifying the key-value pairs under the **Global Context Mapping** [dashboard setting](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/gainsight-px/setup-guide/#connection-settings), as shown:\n\n[![](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/gainsight-px-global-context-mapping.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/gainsight-px-global-context-mapping.webp)\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack gives higher precedence to the global context metadata specified in the event over the key-value pairs specified in the **Global Context Mapping** setting.\n\n## Group\n\nRudderStack associates the user with an account in Gainsight PX when you send a [`group`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/group/) event. It automatically maps the `groupId` to the `accountId` in Gainsight PX.\n\nRudderStack supports all the default fields for `Account` object. In addition, you can map the custom RudderStack event attributes to Gainsight custom attributes in the **Account Attribute Mapping** [dashboard setting](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/gainsight-px/setup-guide/#connection-settings):\n\n[![](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/gainsightpx-group-mapping.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/gainsightpx-group-mapping.webp)\n\nA sample `group` call is shown:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.group(\"group18\", {\n  name: \"Sample Group\",\n  industry: \"Online Streaming\",\n  numberOfEmployees: 10000,\n  website: \"www.example-group.com\",\n  cultureCustomField: \"customfield01\",\n})\n```\n\nIn the above example, `cultureCustomField` is a custom field. You need to provide the mapping for `cultureCustomField` to the corresponding custom attribute `customfield01` [created in Gainsight PX](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/gainsight-px/setup-guide/#create-custom-attributes). If you do not provide this mapping, RudderStack drops the `cultureCustomField` attribute and sends the other attributes to Gainsight PX.\n\nTo update the group details with fewer API calls to Gainsight PX, make sure to set `limitAPIForGroup` to `true` in the event’s `context`, as shown:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.group(\n  'group18', {\n    name: 'New Group Name',\n    industry: 'Online Streaming',\n    numberOfEmployees: 5000,\n    website: 'www.new-group.com',\n    cultureCustomField: 'customfield01',\n  }, {\n    integrations: {\n      All: true,\n      GAINSIGHT_PX: {\n        limitAPIForGroup: true\n      }\n    }\n  },\n);\n```\n\nNote that the if the `groupId` is invalid, then RudderStack creates a new group in Gainsight PX with the provided ID.\n\n## Location attribute mapping\n\nRudderStack maps the below event properties to the corresponding location properties of the Gainsight PX `User` and `Account` objects:\n\n| RudderStack property | Gainsight PX property |\n| --- | --- |\n| `countryName` | `location.countryName` |\n| `countryCode` | `location.countryCode` |\n| `stateName` | `location.stateName` |\n| `stateCode` | `location.stateCode` |\n| `city` | `location.city` |\n| `street` | `location.street` |\n| `postalCode` | `location.postalCode` |\n| `continent` | `location.continent` |\n| `regionName` | `location.regionName` |\n| `timeZone` | `location.timeZone` |\n| `latitude` | `location.coordinates.latitude` |\n| `longitude` | `location.coordinates.longitude` |\n\nQuestions?

Add the following dependencies in your `Podfile`:\n\n```\npod 'FullStory', :http => 'https://ios-releases.fullstory.com/fullstory-1.18.0-xcframework.tar.gz'\npod 'Rudder-FullStory', :git => 'https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-integration-fullstory-ios.git', :tag => 'v1.0.0'\n```\n\n2.  Run the `pod install` command.\n3.  Add the following imports to your `AppDelegate.m` file:\n\n```\n#import <Rudder/Rudder.h>\n#import <RudderFullStoryFactory.h>\n```\n\n4.  Initialize your iOS SDK:\n\n```\nRSConfigBuilder *configBuilder = [[RSConfigBuilder alloc] init];\n[configBuilder withDataPlaneUrl:dataPlaneUrl];\n[configBuilder withFactory:[RudderFullStoryFactory instance]];\nRSClient *rudderClient = [RSClient getInstance:writeKey config:[configBuilder build]];\n```\n\nTo complete the FullStory integration, you need to specify which FullStory organization to record. Follow these steps:\n\n1.  Open your app’s `Info.plist`.\n2.  From the menu, choose **Editor** > **Add Item**. Set the key name to `FullStory` and type to `Dictionary`.\n3.  Right-click the FullStory row and choose **Add Row**. Set the key name to `OrgId` and type to `String`. For the value, paste your assigned organization ID.\n\nWhen configured correctly, the `Info.plist` entry should look as follows:\n\n![Final entry](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/fullstory-devicemode-ios.webp)\n\nFor more information, see [FullStory iOS documentation](https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360042772333-Getting-Started-with-iOS-Recording).\n\n1.  Open your `app/build.gradle` (Module: app) file and add the following under the `dependencies` section:\n\n```\nimplementation 'com.rudderstack.android.sdk:core:1.0.22'\nimplementation 'com.rudderstack.android.integration:fullstory:1.0.0'\nimplementation 'com.google.code.gson:gson:2.8.6'\n// FullStory\nrepositories {\n  maven { url \"https://maven.fullstory.com\" }\n}\nimplementation 'com.fullstory:instrumentation-full:1.18.0@aar'\n```\n\n2.  Add the FullStory Maven plugin to your build script. To do so, add the following snippet into the `Gradle Scripts` section of your root `build.gradle`:\n\n```\nbuildscript {\n  repositories {\n    google()\n    jcenter()\n    maven { url \"https://maven.fullstory.com\" }\n  }\n  dependencies {\n    classpath 'com.fullstory:gradle-plugin-local:PLUGIN_VERSION'\n    // NOTE: Do not place your application dependencies here; they belong\n    // in the individual module build.gradle files\n  }\n}\n\nallprojects {\n    repositories {\n        google()\n        mavenCentral()\n    }\n}\n```\n\n3.  Replace `PLUGIN_VERSION` with the correct version of the FullStory Android plugin. You can find the latest release notes [here](https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/4412766845591).\n4.  To apply the FullStory plugin, add the following snippet into your app-specific `build.gradle` (if your Gradle file adds plugins via plugin ID):\n\n```\nplugins {\n  id 'com.android.application'\n  id 'fullstory'\n}\nfullstory {\n  org 'YOUR_ORG_ID_HERE'\n}\n```\n\n5.  If your Gradle file applies plugins, use the following snippet instead:\n\n```\napply plugin: 'com.android.application'\napply plugin: 'fullstory'\nfullstory {\n  org 'YOUR_ORG_ID_HERE' // Replace with your organization ID.\n}\n```\n\n6.  To apply FullStory to all variants, including those used at debug time, add the following line below `org`:\n\n```\norg 'YOUR_ORG_ID_HERE'\nenabledVariants 'all'\n```\n\n7.  Add the following permissions, if not present already, to your `AndroidManifest.xml`:\n\n```\n<uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.INTERNET\"/>\n<uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE\"/>\n```\n\n8.  Initialize the Android SDK in your `Application` class’ `onCreate()` method as shown:\n\n```\n// initialize Rudder SDK\nval rudderClient =\n    RudderClient.getInstance(\n        this,\n        WRITE_KEY,\n        RudderConfig.Builder()\n            .withDataPlaneUrl(DATA_PLANE_URL)\n            .withFactory(FullStoryIntegrationFactory.FACTORY)\n            .build()\n    )\n```\n\nFor more information, see [FullStory Android documentation](https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040596093-Getting-Started-with-Android-Recording).",

RudderStack, in turn, sends this data to Google Ads.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack maps `properties.currency`, `properties.order_id`, and `properties.revenue` in the event to Google Ads’ `currency`, `transaction_id`, and `value` fields respectively. Note that this is applicable only when the **Track Dynamic Remarketing** setting is turned off in the dashboard.\n\nA sample `track` call is as shown:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track('track conversion', {\n  revenue: 125,\n  currency: 'INR',\n  order_id: 'order_1'\n});\n```\n\nA sample `track` call after turning on the **Track Dynamic Remarketing** setting in the dashboard is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track('view_item', {\n  'value': 998.55,\n  'items': [{\n      'id': 1234,\n      'google_business_vertical': 'retail'\n    },\n    {\n      'id': 45678,\n      'google_business_vertical': 'retail'\n    }\n  ]\n});\n```\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> The format for passing the parameters is quite flexible.

By default, RudderStack sends all `page` calls to FullStory as events.\n\nA sample `page` call is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.page(\"homepage\");\n```\n\nThe above call sends a `Viewed a Page` event to FullStory along with the following properties:\n\n*   `name` (`homepage` in the above example)\n*   `path`\n*   `referrer`\n*   `search`\n*   `title`\n*   `url`\n\nRudderStack also passes any additional properties in the `page` call to FullStory.\n\n## Screen\n\nThe [`screen`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/screen/) call is the mobile equivalent of the [`page`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/page/) call. It lets you record the screen views on your mobile app along with other relevant information about the screen.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack sends the `screen` call to FullStory as a custom event.\n\nA sample `screen` call is shown below:\n\n```\nMainApplication.rudderClient.screen(\n    \"Sample Screen Name\",\n    RudderProperty().putValue(\"prop_key\", \"prop_value\")\n)\n```\n\nIn the above snippet, RudderStack captures all the information related to the viewed screen, along with any additional info associated with that event. In FullStory, the above `screen` call is shown as `Screen Viewed`, along with the associated properties.\n\n## Reset\n\nThe `reset` method resets the previously identified user and any related information. See [FullStory Reset API](https://developer.fullstory.com/anonymize?lang=ObjectiveC) for more information.\n\nA sample `reset` call for iOS is shown below:\n\n```\n[[RSClient sharedInstance] reset];\n```\n\nA sample `reset` call for Android is shown below:\n\n```\nMainApplication.rudderClient.reset()\n```\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### **How do I prevent FullStory from automatically recording on startup?**\n\nBy default, FullStory automatically requests a session and starts recording on the app’s startup.\n\nTo start recording the app only when certain conditions are met, you can use FullStory’s `RecordOnStart` feature. Configuring FullStory to disable `RecordOnStart` prevents any recording until you explicitly invoke `FS.restart`.\n\nFollow these steps:\n\n**For iOS**\n\nIn your iOS app’s `Info.plist` FullStory dictionary, add a `RecordOnStart` key of type `Boolean` with a value of `NO`.\n\nSee [FullStory iOS documentation](https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360042772333-Getting-Started-with-iOS-Recording#01ER0FEDVJS9RJ843477QPRYS6) for more information.\n\n**For Android**\n\nGo to your FullStory plugin configuration (where you set the organiation ID) and set the following:\n\n```\nfullstory {\norg 'YOUR_ORG_ID_HERE'\nrecordOnStart false\n}\n```\n\nSee [FullStory Android documentation](https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040596093-Getting-Started-with-Android-Recording#01F5E7XY5HJYV5ZWCCSYNQ8TXC) for more information.\n\n#### **How do I subclass from an application in Android?**\n\nFullStory requires that you enable MultiDex. If your minSdkVersion is set to 21 or higher, Multidex is enabled by default. In this case, you will need to extend `android.app.Application`, otherwise there will be a build error. If your minSdkVersion is lower than 21, you will need to subclass from `androidx.multidex.MultiDexApplication` instead.\n\nIf you’re using Java and if you do not have an application class, you will need to create one. In your `App.java`, add the following:\n\n```\nimport android.app.Application;\npublic class App extends Application {\n...\n}\n```\n\nIf you’re using Kotlin and if you do not have an application class, you will need to create one and add the following in your `App.kt`:\n\n```\nimport android.app.Application\n\nclass App: Application() {\n...\n}\n```\n\nThen, set `android:name=\"App\"` in your `AndroidManifest.xml` under the `<application>` tag as shown:\n\n```\n<application\nandroid:name=\"App\" ….\n```\n\n#### **Build was configured to prefer settings repositories over project repositories but repository ‘Google’ was added by build file ‘build.gradle’. What do I do?**\n\nGo to your `settings.gradle` file located in the root, and then comment or remove this line: `repositoriesMode.set(RepositoriesMode.FAIL_ON_PROJECT_REPOS)` as shown in the following snippet:\n\n```\ndependencyResolutionManagement {\n    // repositoriesMode.set(RepositoriesMode.FAIL_ON_PROJECT_REPOS)\n    repositories {\n        google()\n        mavenCentral()\n        jcenter() // Warning: this repository is going to shut down soon\n    }\n}\nrootProject.name = \"FullStory_Sample_App\"\ninclude ':app'\n```\n\nFor more information, see [FullStory documentation](https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040596093-Getting-Started-with-Android-Recording#01F5E7X1NYJY51ME0PEWSM0KBJ).\n\nQuestions?

Hence, for an `identify` call, the `email` field is mandatory.\n\nFor the default fields in Gainsight `Person` object, the camelCase notation is used in the RudderStack payload traits.\n\nThe mapping of the RudderStack traits to the Gainsight `Person` object fields is as shown:\n\n| **Gainsight Person Field** | **RudderStack Trait Name** |\n| --- | --- |\n| `Email` | `email` |\n| `Name` | `name` |\n| `FirstName` | `firstName` |\n| `MiddleName` | `middleName` |\n| `LastName` | `lastName` |\n| `LinkedinUrl` | `linkedinUrl` |\n| `Location` | `location` |\n| `ExternalRecordID__gc` | `externalRecordId` |\n| `EmailOptOut` | `emailOptOut` |\n| `DynamicResolutionKey` | `dynamicResolutionKey` |\n| `Comments` | `comments` |\n| `Timezone` | `timezone` |\n| `MasterRecordID` | `masterRecordId` |\n| `MasterAvatarTypeCode` | `masterAvatarTypeCode` |\n\nAn example of the `identify` call in RudderStack is as shown:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify(\n  \"sample-user-id\",\n  {\n    email: \"user@email.com\",\n    firstName: \"John\",\n    lastName: \"Doe\",\n    comments: \"example identify call\",\n  },\n  () => console.log(\"identify callback\")\n)\n```\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Custom fields are supported for `identify`. Refer to the section below for details.\n\n### Custom Fields\n\nYou can create custom fields in the Gainsight schema for a `Person` object as shown in the image below:\n\n[![](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/gainsightcs-custom-field-person.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/gainsightcs-custom-field-person.webp)\n\ngainsightcs-custom-field-person\n\nThen, you can add the RudderStack trait name for the Gainsight custom field mapping in the RudderStack dashboard as shown:\n\n[![](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/gainsightcs-person-map.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/gainsightcs-person-map.webp)\n\ngainsightcs-field-map-person\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> When you add custom fields in the Gainsight schema, `__gc` is automatically suffixed at the end. Therefore, you need to provide the field name including the `__gc` suffix in the RudderStack dashboard as shown above.\n\n## Group\n\nThe `group` call associates a person with a group. RudderStack’s `group` call creates a `Company` object if it is not present or updated with the provided traits. The `Name` field in is used as the unique identifier.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> For making a `group` call, `email` is a mandatory field in `context.traits` of the RudderStack event payload.\n\nThe mapping of the RudderStack traits to the Gainsight `Company` object fields is as shown:\n\n| **Gainsight Company Field** | **RudderStack Trait Name** |\n| --- | --- |\n| `Name` | `name` |\n| `Employees` | `employees` |\n| `Arr` | `arr` |\n| `BillingAddress` | `billingAddress` |\n| `Summary` | `summary` |\n| `Csm` | `csm` |\n| `CustomerlifetimeInMonths` | `customerLifetimeInMonths` |\n| `Industry` | `industry` |\n| `LifecycleInWeeks` | `lifecycleInWeeks` |\n| `ManagedAs` | `managedAs` |\n| `Mrr` | `mrr` |\n| `OriginalContractDate` | `originalContractDate` |\n| `ParentCompany` | `parentCompany` |\n| `RenewalDate` | `renewalDate` |\n| `Stage` | `stage` |\n| `Status` | `status` |\n| `Tags` | `tags` |\n| `TickerSymbol` | `tickerSymbol` |\n| `Users` | `users` |\n| `SfdcAccountId` | `sfdcAccountId` |\n| `IndustryNew` | `industryNew` |\n\nAn example `group` call is as shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.group(\n  \"sample-group-id\",\n  {\n    name: \"Example Company\",\n    employees: 1000,\n    industry: \"Software\",\n  },\n  () => console.log(\"group callback\")\n)\n```\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Custom Fields are supported for the `group` call. For details, refer to the section below.\n\n### Custom Fields\n\nTo send custom properties to Gainsight CS via RudderStack, you first need to create custom fields in the Gainsight schema for the `Company` object, as shown in the following image:\n\n[![](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/gainsightcs-custom-field-company.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/gainsightcs-custom-field-company.webp)\n\ngainsightcs-custom-field-company\n\nThen, you can add the RudderStack trait name for the Gainsight custom field mapping in the RudderStack dashboard:\n\n[![](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/gainsightcs-company-map.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/gainsightcs-company-map.webp)\n\ngainsightcs-field-map-company\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> When you add custom fields in the Gainsight schema, `__gc` is automatically suffixed at the end. Therefore, you need to provide the field name including the `__gc` suffix in the RudderStack dashboard as shown above.\n\n## Track\n\nThe `track` call is used to work with the Gainsight Events Framework. The Gainsight Events Framework lets you create events which can then be used in the **Programs** and **Rules Engine**.\n\nGainsight events are identified with `Event Name` and `Event Version`. The events are grouped under `Topics`. Note that there can be multiple events under a topic.\n\nTo start sending events, you will first need to register as a Publisher in Gainsight by going to **Administration** - **Events** and clicking on **Register as Publisher**. This generates a unique shared secret required for working with Gainsight Events Framework.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> More information on the Gainsight Events Framework can be found in their [support page](https://support.gainsight.com/Gainsight_NXT/Journey_Orchestrator_and_Email_Templates/Programs/Events_Framework#Event_API_Contract).\n\nProvide the required event settings in the RudderStack dashboard as shown:\n\n[![](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/gainsightcs-event-main-settings.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/gainsightcs-event-main-settings.webp)\n\ngainsight-event-main-settings\n\nThe required settings are:\n\n*   **Shared Secret**: This is a required field. Go to **Administration** - **Events** and click **Register as Publisher** to get this key.\n*   **TenantId**: The Tenant ID of the Publisher is a required field. You can copy this ID by going to **Administration** - **Application Settings**.\n*   **Contract ID**: This field is optional. If a user subscribes to a contract, only those subscribers associated with this contract will get the event.\n*   **Topic Name**: This is a required field. The events are grouped under topic.\n\nThe **Contract ID** an be provided in the RudderStack dashboard or in the `track` payload as `externalId`. If both are present, RudderStack gives higher precedence to the `externalId` .\n\nThe following is an example of sending `contractId` via a `track` call:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\n  \"Ticket Closure\",\n  {\n    name: \"John Doe\",\n    status: \"resolved\",\n  },\n  {\n    externalId: [\n      {\n        type: \"gainsightEventContractId\",\n        id: \"sample-contract-id\",\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n  () => console.log(\"track callback\")\n)\n```\n\n### Using RudderStack’s `track` call with Gainsight Events\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Both the event `name` and `version` are needed to use `track` with Gainsight Events.\n\nFirst, create a new event under a particular topic in Gainsight:\n\n[![](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/gainsightcs-event-create.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/gainsightcs-event-create.webp)\n\ngainsightcs-event-map-sample\n\nThen, provide this event name and the version mapping in the RudderStack dashboard as shown:\n\n[![](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/gainsightcs-event-map-sample.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/gainsightcs-event-map-sample.webp)\n\ngainsightcs-event-map-sample\n\nYou are now ready to send events to Gainsight using the `track` method.\n\nAn example of a `track` call is as shown:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\n  \"Ticket Closure\",\n  {\n    name: \"John Doe\",\n    status: \"resolved\",\n  },\n  () => console.log(\"track callback\")\n)\n```\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> To send Gainsight Events to more than one topic, we recommend creating new Gainsight destinations in the RudderStack dashboard for each topic.\n\nQuestions?

    "markdown": "# Google Ads Offline Conversions | RudderStack Docs\n\nSend your event data from RudderStack to Google Ads Offline Conversions.\n\n* * *\n\n*     8 minute read  \n    \n\n[Google Ads Offline Conversions](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/2998031?hl=en&ref_topic=7280668) helps you track the offline sales which occur when your ads lead to a click or call to your business. It lets you measure your sale conversions in the offline mode after a user clicks your ad online but does not directly proceed to sale in the online mode.\n\n## Getting started\n\nRudderStack supports sending event data to Google Ads Offline Conversions via the following [connection modes](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/):\n\n| **Connection Mode** | **Web** | **Mobile** | **Server** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Device mode** | \\-  | \\-  | \\-  |\n| **Cloud mode** | **Supported** | **Supported** | **Supported** |\n\nOnce you have confirmed that the source platform supports sending events to Google Ads Offline Conversions, follow these steps:\n\n1.  From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add the source. Then, from the list of destinations, select **Google Ads Offline Conversions**.\n2.  Assign a name to your destination and click **Continue**.\n\n### Connection settings\n\nTo successfully configure Google Ads Offline Conversions as a destination, first authenticate your account by following the below steps:\n\n1.  Click **Create Account** in the **Account Settings** section.\n2.  From the modal, click the **Sign in with Google** button.\n3.  Choose the required account and grant RudderStack the required permissions.\n4.  Click **Save** to use the specified account:\n\n[![Google Account authentication](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/account-connect-normal.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/account-connect-normal.webp)\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> In case you have authenticated multiple accounts, you can click **Edit Credentials** to select or delete any other authenticated account:\n> \n> ![Google Account authentication](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/edit-account-creds.webp)\n> \n> RudderStack **gives an error** if you try to delete an account used by any other connection set up for the same destination.\n\nNext, configure the following settings:\n\n*   **Customer ID**: Enter the ID associated with your Google Ads account. See [FAQ](#faq) for more information on obtaining your customer ID.\n*   **Subaccount**: Enable this setting if you are using a Google Ads subaccount. See [Google Ads](https://support.google.com/campaignmanager/answer/2829448?hl=en#zippy=%2Cwhat-are-subaccounts) documentation for more information on subaccounts.\n*   **Map your events with Google Ads Offline Conversions**: Enter the RudderStack event name you want to map to the **Click**, **Call**, or **Store** conversion type in Google Ads.\n*   **Map your Google Ads Conversions Names**: Enter the RudderStack event name corresponding to the Google Ads Conversion name created in the Google Ads dashboard. See [FAQ](#how-to-create-the-click-and-call-conversions-in-google-ads-dashbard) for more information on creating click and call conversions in Google Ads dashboard.\n*   **Map your variable names to custom Google Ads variables**: Enter the `track` event property which you want to map to the Google Ads custom variable (defined in the Google dashboard). See [FAQ](#how-do-i-create-custom-variables-in-google-ads-dashboard-which-event-properties-can-i-map-with-these-variables) for more information.\n*   **User Identifier Source**: Select the type of user identifier source from the dropdown. See [Google Ads API documentation](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/rest/reference/rest/v13/UserIdentifier#useridentifiersource) for more information on the different source types.\n*   **Conversion Environment**: Select the conversion environment of the uploaded conversion from the dropdown. See [Google documentation](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/rest/reference/rest/v13/customers/uploadClickConversions#ConversionEnvironment) for more information on the different conversion environments.\n*   **The user identifier for store and click conversions**: Select the default user identifier from `email` or `phone` for store and click conversions.\n*   **Hash User Identifying Information (SHA-256)**: This setting is enabled by default and hashes the user identifying information like `email` and `phone number` using SHA-256.\n*   **Validate Only**: Enable this setting to only validate the request and not execute it. See [Google Ads documentation](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/rest/reference/rest/v13/customers/uploadClickConversions) for more information.\n\n## Google Ads permissions\n\nThis integration relies on the authorizing Google Ads user’s [underlying permissions](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/9978556) and must be at least **Standard** or **Admin**.\n\nIf you authorize the integration without the **Standard** or **Admin** permissions, the API calls will fail and a “RudderStack Admin” user will disable the integration. If you encounter an entry in your [audit logs](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/dashboard-guides/audit-logs/) from a `Rudder Admin/admin@rudderstack.com` user, it means that RudderStack disabled the integration on account of insufficient user permissions.\n\nTo avoid this, ensure that the authorizing user has the **Standard** permissions, at minimum.\n\n## Track\n\nRudderStack associates the [`track`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/track/) event with the event name defined in the **Map your events with Google Ads Offline Conversions** dashboard setting.\n\nRudderStack supports the following conversion types:\n\n### Click conversion\n\nYou can create a conversion action to [upload offline click conversions](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/conversions/upload-clicks) into Google Ads. The [Google Ads Click Conversion API](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v13/ConversionUploadService#uploadclickconversions) processes these click conversions.\n\nA sample `track` call for a click conversion is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track('sign up completed', {\n  gclid: \"gclid_value\",\n  conversionDateTime: \"2022-05-20 12:32:45-08:00\"\n});\n```\n\nThe following table lists the property mappings between RudderStack and Google Ads Offline Conversions for the click conversion type:\n\n| RudderStack property | Google Ads Offline Conversions property | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `properties.conversionDateTime`  <br>`timestamp`  <br>`originalTimestamp`  <br>Required | `conversionDateTime` | Date and time at which the conversion occurred. It must be after the click time and must include the timezone offset.<br><br>The format for this field is `yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss +/- hh:mm`.<br><br>For example, `2019-01-01 12:32:45-08:00`. |\n| `traits.email`  <br>`context.traits.email` | `hashedEmail` | If **User Identifier Source** is set in the dashboard, either `email` or `phone` must be passed. |\n| `traits.phone`  <br>`context.traits.phone` | `hashedPhoneNumber` | If **User Identifier Source** is set in the dashboard, either `email` or `phone` must be passed. |\n| `properties.gclid` | `gclid` | \\-  |\n| `properties.gbraid` | `gbraid` | \\-  |\n| `properties.wbraid` | `wbraid` | \\-  |\n| `properties.externalAttributionCredit` | `externalAttributionCredit` | \\-  |\n| `properties.externalAttributionModel` | `externalAttributionModel` | \\-  |\n| `properties.merchantId` | `merchantId` | \\-  |\n| `properties.feedCountryCode` | `feedCountryCode` | \\-  |\n| `properties.feedLanguageCode` | `feedLanguageCode` | \\-  |\n| `properties.localTransactionCost` | `localTransactionCost` | \\-  |\n| `properties.product_id`  <br>`properties.sku` | `productId` | \\-  |\n| `properties.quantity` | `quantity` | \\-  |\n| `properties.price` | `unitPrice` | \\-  |\n| `properties.userIdentifierSource` | `userIdentifierSource` | \\-  |\n| `properties.conversionEnvironment` | `conversionEnvironment` | \\-  |\n| `properties.conversionValue`  <br>`properties.total`  <br>`properties.value`  <br>`properties.revenue` | `conversionValue` | \\-  |\n| `properties.currencyCode`  <br>`properties.currency` | `currencyCode` | \\-  |\n| `properties.orderId`  <br>`properties.order_id` | `orderId` | \\-  |\n\nSee [ID parameters](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/conversions/upload-clicks#id_parameters) section for detailed guidelines on passing the combinations of `wbraid`, `gbraid`, and `gclid` parameters.\n\n### Call conversion\n\nYou can create a conversion action to [upload offline call conversions](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/conversions/upload-calls) into Google Ads. The [Google Ads Call Conversion API](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v13/ConversionUploadService#uploadcallconversions) processes these call conversions.\n\nA sample `track` call for a call conversion is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track('login', {\n  callerId: \"callerId_value\",\n  callStartDateTime: \"2022-08-12 15:01:30+05:30\",\n  conversionDateTime: \"2022-09-24 12:32:45-08:00\"\n});\n```\n\nThe following table lists the property mappings between RudderStack and Google Ads Offline Conversions for the call conversion type:\n\n| RudderStack property | Google Ads Offline Conversions property |\n| --- | --- |\n| `properties.callerId`  <br>Required | `callerId` |\n| `properties.callStartDateTime`  <br>Required | `callStartDateTime` |\n| `properties.conversionDateTime`  <br>`originalTimestamp`  <br>Required | `conversionDateTime` |\n| `properties.conversionValue`  <br>`properties.total`  <br>`properties.value`  <br>`properties.revenue` | `conversionValue` |\n| `properties.currencyCode`  <br>`properties.currency` | `currencyCode` |\n\n### Store conversion\n\nYou can create a conversion action to [upload store sales conversions](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/conversions/upload-store-sales-transactions) into Google Ads. The [Google Ads Store Conversion API](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v13/OfflineUserDataJobService#createofflineuserdatajob) creates an offline user data job.\n\nA sample `track` call for a store sales conversion is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"Product Reviewed\",{\n    \"loyaltyFraction\": 1,\n    \"order_id\": \"order id\",\n    \"currency\": \"USD\",\n    \"revenue\": \"100\",\n    \"store_code\": \"store code\",\n    \"email\": \"alex@example.com\",\n    \"gclid\": \"gclid\",\n    \"conversionDateTime\": \"2022-01-01 12:32:45-08:00\",\n    \"product_id\": \"123445\",\n    \"custom_key\": \"CUSTOM_KEY\",\n    \"CUSTOM_KEY\": \"CUSTOM_VALUE\",\n    \"quantity\": 123\n  })\n```\n\nThe below fields are required to send the store conversions successfully:\n\n*   `event`\n*   Any one of the `properties.total`, `properties.value`, `properties.revenue`, or `properties.currency`\n\nSee [job creation](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-transformer/blob/develop/src/v0/destinations/google_adwords_offline_conversions/data/TrackCreateJobStoreConversionsConfig.json), [address info](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-transformer/blob/develop/src/v0/destinations/google_adwords_offline_conversions/data/storeAddoperationAddressMap.json), and [conversion mapping](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-transformer/blob/develop/src/v0/destinations/google_adwords_offline_conversions/data/TrackAddStoreConversionsConfig.json) parameter mappings for more information on the optional fields you can send in the payload.\n\nIf you specify a user identifier in **The user identifier for store and click conversions** setting but don’t include it in the payload, RudderStack looks for the following fields as user identifiers (in the same priority order):\n\n1.  Address\n2.  Email\n3.  Phone\n\nIf none of the above are present, RudderStack sends an empty user identifier.\n\n### Specify consent for click and call conversions\n\nYou can specify user consent for leveraging their data for advertisements and personalization in case of [click](#click-conversion) and [call](#call-conversion) conversions. To do so, use the `integrations` object in your `track` event as follows:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track('Signup Completed', {\n  prop1: 'val1',\n  gclid: \"gclid_value\",\n  conversionDateTime: \"2022-05-20 12:32:45-08:00\"\n}, {\n  \"integrations\": {\n    \"GOOGLE_ADWORDS_OFFLINE_CONVERSIONS\": {\n      \"consents\": {\n        \"adUserData\": \"GRANTED\",\n        \"adPersonalization\": \"GRANTED\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n});\n```\n\nNote the following:\n\n*   The permissible values for the `adUserData` and `adPersonalization` fields are:\n    *   `UNSPECIFIED`\n    *   `UNKNOWN`\n    *   `GRANTED`\n*   If you set these fields to any other value, RudderStack automatically changes them to `UNKNOWN`.\n*   If you do not set the `consents` field in the event payload, RudderStack sets the `adUserData` and `adPersonalization` fields to `UNSPECIFIED` by default.\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### Where can I find my Google Ads customer ID?\n\nTo get the customer ID associated with your Google Ads account, click the **Help** option in your Google Ads dashboard. You will find the customer ID in the resulting pop-up:\n\n[![Google Adwords Offline Conversions connection settings](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/google-adwords-remarketing-lists-customer-id.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/google-adwords-remarketing-lists-customer-id.webp)\n\n  \n\n#### How do I create custom variables in Google Ads dashboard?

To accept the terms:\n    \n    1.  Log in to your Google Ads dashboard.\n    2.  Go to **Conversions** > **Settings** > **Customer Data Terms**.\n    3.  Carefully read and accept the customer data terms.\n\n[![Google Ads Enhanced Conversions data terms](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/g-ads-conversions-data-terms.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/g-ads-conversions-data-terms.webp)\n\n## Getting started\n\nRudderStack supports sending event data to Google Ads Enhanced Conversions via the following [connection modes](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/):\n\n| **Connection Mode** | **Web** | **Mobile** | **Server** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Device mode** | \\-  | \\-  | \\-  |\n| **Cloud mode** | **Supported** | **Supported** | **Supported** |\n\nOnce you have confirmed that the source platform supports sending events to Google Ads Enhanced Conversions, follow these steps:\n\n1.  From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add the source. Then, from the list of destinations, select **Google Ads Enhanced Conversions**.\n2.  Assign a name to your destination and click **Continue**.\n\n### Connection settings\n\nTo successfully configure Google Ads Enhanced Conversions as a destination, first authenticate your account by following the below steps:\n\n1.  Click **Create Account** in the **Account Settings** section.\n2.  From the modal, click the **Sign in with Google** button.\n3.  Choose the required account and grant RudderStack the required permissions.\n4.  Click **Save** to use the specified account:\n\n[![Google Account authentication](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/account-connect-normal.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/account-connect-normal.webp)\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> In case you have authenticated multiple accounts, you can click **Edit Credentials** to select or delete any other authenticated account:\n> \n> ![Google Account authentication](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/edit-account-creds.webp)\n> \n> RudderStack **gives an error** if you try to delete an account used by any other connection set up for the same destination.\n\nNext, configure the following settings:\n\n*   **Customer ID**: Enter the ID associated with your Google Ads account. You can find it by clicking the **Help** option in your dashboard. For more information on obtaining the customer ID, refer to the [Google Ads Help Center](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/1704344?hl=en) page.\n*   **Subaccount**: Enable this setting if you are using a Google Ads subaccount. For more information on subaccounts, refer to the [Google Ads Help Center](https://support.google.com/campaignmanager/answer/2829448?hl=en#zippy=%2Cwhat-are-subaccounts) page.\n*   **Login Customer ID**: Enter the customer ID of the manager account (associated with the subaccount). This field is required only when you want to send data to a customer list of a subaccount.\n*   **List of Conversion**: Enter the list of events on which you want to perform enhanced conversions. RudderStack will discard any events that are not specified in this list.\n*   **Hashing Required**: This setting is enabled by default and hash encrypts the user identifiers like email, phone number, first name, last name, and street address using the SHA256 encryption method.\n\n## Google Ads permissions\n\nThis integration relies on the authorizing Google Ads user’s [underlying permissions](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/9978556) and must be at least **Standard** or **Admin**.\n\nIf you authorize the integration without the **Standard** or **Admin** permissions, the API calls will fail and a “RudderStack Admin” user will disable the integration. If you encounter an entry in your [audit logs](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/dashboard-guides/audit-logs/) from a `Rudder Admin/admin@rudderstack.com` user, it means that RudderStack disabled the integration on account of insufficient user permissions.\n\nTo avoid this, ensure that the authorizing user has the **Standard** permissions, at minimum.\n\n## Track\n\nThe [`track`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/track/) call lets you record and send the conversion events along with any properties associated with them. RudderStack uses the [`ConversionAdjustment`](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/rpc/v12/ConversionAdjustment) method to send the `track` events to Google Ads.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> You must create the [conversion actions](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/12216226?hl=en) in Google Ads before sending the associated conversion events from RudderStack. Also, the conversion names should match in Rudderstack (**List of Conversion** dashboard setting) and Google Ads dashboards.\n\nA sample `track` call is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"Order Completed\", {\n  checkout_id: \"12345\",\n  orderId: \"123\",\n  affiliation: \"Apple Store\",\n  gclid: \"abcd1234\",\n  conversionDateTime: \"2019-01-01 12:32:45-08:00\",\n  adjustedValue: 100,\n  currencyCode: \"INR\",\n  adjustmentDateTime: \"2019-01-01 12:32:45-08:00\",\n  total: 20,\n  revenue: 15.0,\n  shipping: 22,\n  tax: 1,\n  discount: 1.5,\n  coupon: \"SAVE45\",\n  currency: \"USD\",\n  products: [\n    {\n      product_id: \"FS247\",\n      sku: \"G-32\",\n      name: \"Monopoly\",\n      price: 14,\n      quantity: 1,\n      category: \"Games\",\n      url: \"https://www.estore.com/product/funskool-monopoly\",\n    },\n  ],\n})\n```\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> `orderId` is a required field to send a `track` call successfully.\n\n### Supported mappings\n\nThe following table details the mapping of the fields specified in the RudderStack dashboard and Google Ads Enhanced Conversions, along with the relevant guidelines:\n\n| RudderStack field | Google Ads Enhanced Conversions field | Guidelines |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `gclid` | `gclid` | This is the Google click ID associated with the original conversion. |\n| `conversionDateTime` | `conversionDateTime` | The datetime at which the conversion for the adjustment occurred. You must specify the timezone in the format \\`yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss+ |\n| `adjustedValue` | `adjustedValue` | The value of the conversion after restatement. To change the value of a conversion from `100` to `75`, for example, you should report an adjusted value of `75`. |\n| `currencyCode` | `currencyCode` | Use the ISO 4217 3-character currency code, e.g. `USD`/`EUR`. |\n| `orderId` | `orderId` | If a conversion was reported with a specific order ID, then that order ID must be used as the identifier. |\n| `adjustmentDateTime` | `adjustmentDateTime` | The datetime at which the adjustment occurred. You must specify the timezone in the format \\`yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss+ |\n| `userAgent` | `userAgent` | User agent should only be specified in enhancements with the user identifiers and it should match the user agent of the request that sent the original conversion. This is so that the conversion and the enhancement both are either attributed as same or cross-device. |\n| `email` | `hashedEmail` | Include a domain name for all email addresses. Remove any spaces in between the addresses. |\n| `phone` | `hashedPhone` | Format the phone number using the [E.164 format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.164). Include the country code as well. |\n| `firstName` | `hashedFirstName` | Do not include any prefixes (e.g., `Mrs.`). |\n| `lastName` | `hashedLastName` | Do not include any suffixes (e.g., `Sr.`). |\n| `city` | `city` | This field accepts any string. |\n| `state` | `state` | This field accepts any string. |\n| `country` / `countryCode` | `countryCode` | Use the ISO two-letter/three-letter [country codes](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/data/codes-formats#expandable-16). Include the country code even if all your users belong to the same country. |\n| `postalCode` | `postalCode` | Both the US and international zip and postal codes are allowed. For the US, 5 digit codes followed by 4 digit extensions are also allowed. For the rest of the countries, do not include the postal code extensions. |\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### According to my audit logs, a “Rudder Admin” user updated my destination. Why is this?\n\nThis is a Google Ads permissions issue. See [Google Ads Permissions](#google-ads-permissions) for details.\n\n#### Can I set up the Enhanced Conversions and Remarketing Lists destinations using the same Google Ads account?\n\nYes, you can. Both the integrations are the sub-features of Google Ads. Hence, you can use the same Google Ads account to configure both the destinations in RudderStack.\n\n#### Where can I find my Google Ads customer ID?\n\nTo get the customer ID associated with your Google Ads account, click the **Help** option in your Google Ads dashboard. You will find the customer ID in the resulting pop-up:\n\n[![Google Ads Enhanced Conversions connection settings](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/google-adwords-remarketing-lists-customer-id.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/google-adwords-remarketing-lists-customer-id.webp)\n\n#### What are the account permissions required for this integration?\n\nFor the integration to be successful, make sure the customer account used for OAuth verification adheres to Google’s [Customer Match policy](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/6299717) and has **Standard** or higher (**Administrative**) access level permissions. For more information on the access level permissions, refer to this [Google Ads support page](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/9978556?visit_id=637611563637058259-4176462731&rd=1).\n\nTo set the access level, follow these steps:\n\n1.  Sign into to your Google Ads account and go to **TOOLS AND SETTINGS** > **Access and security**:\n\n[![Access and Security option in Google Ads dashboard](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/gads-access-security.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/gads-access-security.webp)\n\n2.  Enter the email address of the account and from the list of permissions, select **Standard** or **Administrative**. Then, click **SEND INVITATION**:\n\n[![Specifying access levels](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/gads-specify-access-level.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/gads-specify-access-level.webp)\n\nThe account will have the access level permissions once they accept the invitation.\n\n#### I am getting a 400 Bad Request error message. What should I do?\n\nIf you get a 400 Bad Request error while configuring the destination, make sure your customer account is allowlisted and configured to have **Standard** or **Administrative** access levels in Google Ads. Refer to the above [FAQ](#what-are-the-account-permissions-required-for-this-integration) for steps on setting the access level permissions for the account.\n\nQuestions?

Based on your website’s content security policy, you might need to [allowlist this domain](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/load-js-sdk/#allowlist-destination-domain) to load the Google Analytics SDK successfully.\n\nOnce you have confirmed that the source platform supports sending events to Google Analytics, follow these steps:\n\n1.  From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add the source. Then, from the list of destinations, select **Google Analytics**.\n2.  Assign a name to the destination and click **Continue**.\n\n## Connection settings\n\nTo successfully set up Google Analytics as a destination, configure the following settings:\n\n*   **Tracking ID**: Enter the Google Analytics tracking ID from your Google Analytics dashboard. See [FAQ](#faq) for more information on obtaining the tracking ID.\n*   **Client-side Events Filtering**: This setting lets you specify which events should be blocked or allowed to flow through to Google Analytics. For more information, see [Client-side Events Filtering](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/event-filtering/).\n*   **Remarketing, Display Ads and Demographic Reports**: Enable this setting to tag visitors for the remarketing campaign. See [Enable Remarketing and Advertising Reporting Features](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2444872?hl=en#zippy=%2Cin-this-article) for more information.\n*   **Enable Enhanced Link Attribution**: Enable this setting to retrieve the detailed report of links clicked on your website. See [Enhanced Link Attribution](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2444872?hl=en#zippy=%2Cin-this-article) for more information.\n*   **Include the Querystring in Page Views**: Enable this setting to include the query string in your page views along with the URL to be sent to Google Analytics. For more information on this feature, see [Site search](#site-search).\n*   **Custom Dimensions & Metrics**: Enter the event name, traits, or properties you want to map to the corresponding custom dimensions and metrics. See [Custom dimensions](#custom-dimensions) for more information.\n*   **Property & Trait Mapping**: Enter the property you want to map to the Google Analytics content grouping. See [Content groupings](#content-groupings) for more information.\n*   **Enable Server Side Identify**: Enable this setting to trigger the `identify` calls from the server side.\n*   **Server Side Identify Event Category**: Specify the event category of the `identify` call triggered from the server side. If you specify a category, it is sent as `ec`; otherwise, the default value is set to `All`.\n*   **Server Side Identify Event Action**: Specify the event action of the `identify` call triggered from the server side. If you specify an action, it is sent as `ea`; otherwise, the default value is set to `User Enriched`.\n*   **Disable Md5 encryption from Client ID**: Use this setting to determine how RudderStack should map the `client id`.

See [IP Anonymization](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2763052?hl=en).\n*   **Enable Enhanced Ecommerce**: Enable this setting to derive detailed insights for ecommerce events. See [Enhanced ecommerce](#enhanced-ecommerce) for more information.\n*   **Add the non-interaction flag to all events**: Enable this setting to consider all event hits as non-interaction event hits. For more information on this feature, see [Non-Interaction events](#non-interaction-events).\n*   **Send user-id to GA**: Enable this setting to set a user ID for the identified visitors before sending it to Google Analytics.\n*   **Use device-mode to send events**: Enable this setting to send events to Google Analytics via the web [device mode](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#device-mode).\n*   **Track Categorized Pages**: This setting is enabled by default and lets you track only the pages having a category associated with them.\n*   **Track Named Pages**: This setting is enabled by default and lets you track only those pages that contain a name.\n*   **Sample Rate**: Enter the percentage of users that RudderStack should track. The default value is `100`.\n*   **Site Speed Sample Rate**: Enter the sample size for Site Speed data collection. The default value is `1`.\n*   **Reset dimensions on Page calls**: Specify the dimensions (set in the `page` call properties) that need to be reset and assigned a new value.\n*   **Set Custom Dimensions & Metrics to the Page**: This setting is enabled by default and passes the custom dimensions and metrics as properties for all events on a given page. When disabled, RudderStack only passes the custom dimensions and metrics as part of the event payload with which they are explicitly associated.\n*   **Use Named Tracker**: Enable this setting to push events to the `rudderGATracker` Google Analytics tracker instead of the default tracker. For more information on trackers, see [Named tracker](#named-tracker).\n*   **Cookie Domain Name**: Specify the domain name on which the `_ga` cookie should set on. The default value is set to `auto`. See [Cookies and User Identification](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/domains) for more information.\n*   **Optimize Container ID**: Enter your Optimize container ID to integrate with the Google Analytics [Optimize plugin](https://support.google.com/optimize/answer/6262084#optimize-ga-plugin).\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> If you specify the container ID and Optimize plugin is linked to your Google Analytics property, it will be enabled automatically the next time `analytics.js` is loaded. **Note that this is applicable only if you are using Google Analytics in web device mode**.\n\n*   **Use Google AMP Client ID**: Enable this setting to uniquely identify users who engage with your content on AMP and non-AMP pages. See [Google Analytics session unification for AMP](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/7486764?hl=en&ref_topic=7378717#zippy=%2Cin-this-article) for more information.\n*   **OneTrust Cookie Categories**: If **Use device-mode to send events** is enabled, this setting lets you associate [OneTrust](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/data-governance/consent-management/onetrust/javascript/) cookie consent groups to Google Analytics.\n*   **User deletion**: Use this setting to add and authenticate an account used to delete users in Google Analytics. See [Deleting a user](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/google-analytics-ga/#deleting-a-user) for more information.\n\n## Identify\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack does not support sending Personally Identifiable Information (PII) to the Google Analytics reporting interface.\n\nGoogle Analytics’ universal tracking lets you set a user ID to the identified visitors if you enable the **Send User ID to GA** dashboard setting. Also, you must enable the `userid` property in Google Analytics and create the corresponding view.\n\nA sample `identify` call is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify(\"user123\", {\n  name: \"Alex Keener\",\n  email: \"alex@example.com\"\n});\n```\n\nIn the above snippet, RudderStack sets the `userId` to `user123` in Google Analytics but **does not** share the name and email with Google. You can set the user traits along with custom dimensions, metrics, and content groupings via the SDK calls.\n\nFor sending server-side events, Google Analytics needs a customer identifier for each call. RudderStack passes an internally generated ID as the `cid` parameter for Google Analytics to identify every unique user. RudderStack does not map the user traits to custom dimensions, metrics and content grouping when sending server-side events.\n\nYou can call `identify` once in order to set the `userId` and the associated traits for all subsequent calls that you make for a particular user via RudderStack. If `userId` is not set, RudderStack sends an automatically-generated ID called `anonymousId` from its SDKs with every call. This `id` is used as the `cid` in Google Analytics. If **Send User ID to GA** dashboard setting is enabled, RudderStack sets the event’s `userId` as `uid`.\n\n### Deleting a user\n\nTo [delete a user in Google Analytics](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/config/userdeletion/v3), first [authenticate your Google account](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/config/userdeletion/v3/authorization) in the RudderStack dashboard by following the below steps:\n\n1.  Click **Create Account** in the **User Deletion** section:\n\n[![User deletion](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/user-deletion.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/user-deletion.webp)\n\n2.  From the modal, click the **Sign in with Google** button.\n3.  Choose the required account and grant RudderStack the required permissions.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> If your account authentication fails, you can refer to these [troubleshooting steps](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/config/userdeletion/v3/authorization#troubleshooting) for identifying and fixing the root cause.\n\n4.

Additionally, you can specify a custom identifier (optional) in the event.\n\nA sample regulation request body for deleting a user in Google Analytics is shown below:\n\n```\n{\n  \"regulationType\": \"suppress_with_delete\",\n  \"destinationIds\": [\n    \"2FIKkByqn37FhzczP23eZmURciA\"\n  ],\n  \"users\": [{\n    \"userId\": \"1hKOmRA4GRlm\",\n    \"<customKey>\": \"<customValue>\"\n  }]\n}\n```\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Refer to the [Limits and quotas](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/config/userdeletion/v3/limits-quotas#user_deletion_api) documentation for more information about the specified quotas for the user deletion API requests.\n\n## Track\n\nThe [`track`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/track/) method lets you capture user events along with the associated properties.\n\nA sample `track` call is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"Track me\", {\n  category: \"category\",\n  label: \"label\",\n  value: \"value\"\n});\n```\n\nFor the above call, RudderStack sends the following properties to Google Analytics:\n\n| Property | Value |\n| --- | --- |\n| Event Category | `category` |\n| Event Action | `Track me` |\n| Event Label | `label` |\n| Event Value | `value` |\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack does not populate the `Event Category` field by default. If the event does not contain the `category` property, you can use the [transformations](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/transformations/overview/) feature to manually populate it in the payload.\n\n## Page\n\nRudderStack sends a `pageview` hit to Google Analytics whenever you make a [`page`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/page/) call.\n\nA sample `page` call is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.page({\n  path: \"path\",\n  url: \"url\",\n  title: \"title\",\n  search: \"search\",\n  referrer: \"referrer\"\n});\n```\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> You must send a `path` or `url` property with every `page` call; otherwise, Google Analytics will reject the event.\n\nThe following snippets demonstrate variants of the `page` that involve sending your page `name` and `category`:\n\n```\n// Passing page category and name\nrudderanalytics.page(\"category\", \"name\", {\n  path: \"path\",\n  url: \"url\",\n  title: \"title\",\n  search: \"search\",\n  referrer: \"referrer\",\n})\n\n// \"home\" is the name of the page.\nrudderanalytics.page(\"home\", {\n  path: \"path\",\n  url: \"url\",\n  title: \"title\",\n  search: \"search\",\n  referrer: \"referrer\",\n})\n```\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Note that:\n> \n> *   For a server-side `page` call, you must pass the application name in `context.app.name` contextual property as `an`. Otherwise, Google Analytics will reject the event.\n> *   If the **Include the Querystring in Page Views** setting is enabled in the RudderStack dashboard, then RudderStack sends the entire URL to Google Analytics (including the querystring) as `dp` (Document Path). Otherwise, RudderStack removes the querystring from the URL.\n\n#### Page title in device mode\n\nWhen sending events in [device mode](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#device-mode), RudderStack sets the page title as one of the following, depending on the presence of `message.properties.category` and `message.name` in the event:\n\n| `message.properties.category` | `message.name` | Page title |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Absent | Absent | `pageTitle` = `message.properties.title` |\n| Absent | Present | `pageTitle` = `message.name` |\n| Present | Absent | `pageTitle` = `message.properties.category` |\n| Present | Present | `pageTitle` = `${rudderElement.message.properties.category} ${rudderElement.message.name}` |\n\n#### Page title in cloud mode\n\nWhen sending events in [cloud mode](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#cloud-mode), RudderStack sets page title from the event’s `properties.title` or  `context.page.title`.\n\n## Ecommerce\n\nRudderStack supports ecommerce event tracking for Google Analytics. The prerequisites are listed below:\n\n*   You must enable ecommerce tracking in Google Analytics; otherwise, it will not be shown in the reports.\n*   For every `Order Completed` event, `orderId` is required. Also, for each product in the order, there must be an `id` and `name`. Other properties are optional.\n\n## Enhanced ecommerce\n\n[Enhanced ecommerce](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/enhanced-ecommerce) lets you derive insights from your ecommerce events by combining the data related to product impressions, promotions, and user actions.\n\nTo use this feature, enable the **Enable Enhanced Ecommerce** setting in the RudderStack dashboard and Google Analytics. Also, make sure that your events adhere to RudderStack’s [Ecommerce events specification](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/ecommerce-events-spec/).\n\nSome other prerequisites for enhanced ecommerce tracking are:\n\n*   Similar to ecommerce tracking, for every `Order Completed` event, `orderId` is required. Also, for each product in the order, there must be an `id` and `name`.\n*   `order_id` is required for refunded orders.\n*   You must pass the product ID or name for all events that have the product details. `product_id` checks the presence of `properties.product_id`. Otherwise, `properties.sku` is preferred.\n\n### Measuring checkout steps\n\nCheckout steps is a key feature of enhanced ecommerce tracking and a major differentiator between the regular ecommerce and enhanced ecommerce tracking.\n\nYou can configure the checkout funnel in the Google Analytics admin interface as shown below:\n\n[![MD5 disabled](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/image%20%2821%29.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/image%20%2821%29.webp)\n\nYou can then implement the checkout flow by sending a `track` event named `Checkout Step Viewed` and `Checkout Step Completed` for the steps added in Google Analytics.\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track('Checkout Step Viewed', {\n  currency: 'CAD',\n  step: 1\n});\nrudderanalytics.track('Checkout Step Completed', {\n  currency: 'CAD',\n  step: 1,\n  //if this is the shipping step\n  shippingMethod: 'FedEx',\n  //if this is the payment step\n  paymentMethod: 'Visa'\n});\n```\n\n### Measuring promotions\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track('Promotion Viewed', {\n  currency: 'USD',\n  promotion_id: 'PROMO_12345',\n  name: 'Winter Sale',\n  creative: 'winter_banner2',\n  position: 'banner_slot1',\n  testDimension: true,\n  testMetric: true\n});\nrudderanalytics.track('Promotion Clicked', {\n  currency: 'USD',\n  promotion_id: 'PROMO_12345',\n  name: 'winter Sale',\n  creative: 'winter_banner2',\n  position: 'banner_slot1',\n  testDimension: true,\n  testMetric: true\n});\n```\n\n### Coupons\n\nYou can add the `coupon` property in your event to send your coupon data in the `Order Completed` event.\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track('Order Completed', {\n  orderId: 'abc55',\n  total: 999.9,\n  shipping: 23.99,\n  tax: 25.99,\n  currency: 'USD',\n  coupon: 'coupon',\n  affiliation: 'affiliation',\n  testDimension: true,\n  testMetric: true,\n  products: [{\n      quantity: 1,\n      price: 24.75,\n      name: 'rudder product',\n      category: 'cat 1',\n      sku: 'p-298',\n      productDimension: 'testing'\n    },\n    {\n      quantity: 3,\n      price: 24.75,\n      name: 'other product',\n      category: 'cat 2',\n      sku: 'p-299',\n      currency: 'EUR',\n      productDimension: 'testing'\n    }\n  ]\n});\n```\n\n### Measuring product impressions\n\nYou can use enhanced ecommerce tracking to collect impressions-related information like the users who have viewed or filtered through the product. RudderStack maps the product impressions to the `Product List Viewed` and `Product List Filtered` events:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track('Product List Viewed', {\n  category: 'cat 1',\n  list_id: '1234',\n  products: [{\n      product_id: '507f1f77bcf86cd799439011',\n      productDimension: 'My Product Dimension1',\n      productMetric: 'My Product Metric1',\n      position: 10\n    },\n    {\n      product_id: '507f1f77bcf86cd799439012',\n      productDimension: 'My Product Dimension2',\n      productMetric: 'My Product Metric2',\n      position: 12\n    },\n    {\n      product_id: '507f1f77bcf86cd799439015',\n      productDimension: 'My Product Dimension3',\n      productMetric: 'My Product Metric3',\n      position: 8\n    }\n  ]\n});\n```\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track('Product List Filtered', {\n  category: 'cat 1',\n  list_id: '1234',\n  filters: [{\n      type: 'department',\n      value: 'beauty'\n    },\n    {\n      type: 'price',\n      value: 'under'\n    }\n  ],\n  sorts: [{\n    type: 'price',\n    value: 'desc'\n  }],\n  products: [{\n    product_id: '507f1f77bcf86cd799439011',\n    productDimension: 'My Product Dimension',\n    productMetric: 'My Product Metric'\n  }],\n  testDimension: true,\n  testMetric: true\n});\n```\n\n### Refunds\n\nFor full refunds, you can use the `Order Refunded` event:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track('Order Refunded', {\n  order_id: 'abc55',\n  testDimension: true,\n  testMetric: true\n});\n```\n\nFor partial refunds, a sample `Order Refunded` event is as follows:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track('Order Refunded', {\n  order_id: 'abc55',\n  products: [{\n      quantity: 1,\n      sku: 'p-1'\n    },\n    {\n      quantity: 2,\n      sku: 'p-2'\n    }\n  ],\n  testDimension: true,\n  testMetric: true\n});\n```\n\n## Additional features\n\nThe following sections highlight some other important features of this integration.\n\n### Passing cookies from Universal Analytics\n\nRudderStack uses the client ID (`cid`) to keep a track of unique visitors to your website. A sample Google Analytics universal cookie with the client ID `476220681.159039102` looks like the following:\n\n```\n_ga=GA1.2.476220681.159039102;\n```\n\nYou can verify the client ID by running the following snippet:\n\n```\nga(function (tracker) {\n    var clientId = tracker.get('clientId');\n    console.log('My GA universal client ID is: ' + clientId);\n});\n```\n\nFor server-side events, if you set the client ID manually by sending `anonymousId` in your event and if the **Send user ID to Google Analytics** dashboard setting is enabled, then RudderStack passes the `userId` as the `uid` to Google Analytics along with the `cid` parameter. For more information, see [Identify](#identify) section above.\n\n#### How RudderStack takes `clientId`\n\nIf **Disable Md5 encryption from Client ID** dashboard setting is enabled, RudderStack takes the client ID in the following priority order:\n\n1.  From the `integrations` object while initializing the SDK:\n\n```\n\"integrations\": {\n  \"All\": true,\n  \"Google Analytics\": {\n    \"clientId\": \"clientId\"\n  }\n},\n```\n\n2.  From `gaExternalId` by setting it as the client ID, if specified in the payload:\n\n```\n\"externalId\": [{\n  \"id\": \"externalClientId\",\n  \"type\": \"gaExternalId\"\n}]\n```\n\n3.  From `traits.cid`.\n4.  From `anonymousId`.\n\nIf none of the above is present, `clientId` is set as `undefined`.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> If **Disable Md5 encryption from Client ID** dashboard setting is disabled and the `integrations` object, `externalId`, `traits.cid`, and `anonymousId` are all absent, RudderStack passes the event’s `userId` as the client ID in an MD5-hashed format.\n\n### User agent\n\nDuring server-side tracking, RudderStack maps `user_agent` to the following parameters:\n\n*   `message.traits.ua` for `identify` events.\n*   `context.userAgent` for `track` and `page` events.\n\n### Visitor geolocation\n\nDuring client-side tracking, RudderStack automatically sends the IP address of the HTTP request to determine the visitor’s location. However, for server-side tracking, you must include the visitor’s IP in the `track` call.\n\n### UTM parameters\n\nRudderStack’s [JavaScript](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/) SDK automatically maps the UTM parameters from the URL and send them to Google Analytics.\n\nFor the other SDKs, you must manually pass the UTM parameters in your event’s `context` object via the `context.campaign`, `campaign.name`, and `campaign.mediums` properties for them to show up in your Google Analytics report. Note that `campaign.term` and `campaign.content` are optional properties.\n\nFor the `identify` events, you can also pass the UTM parameters via the `message.traits` object.\n\n### Measurement protocol parameters\n\nWhen sending events to Google Analytics via server-side tracking, you can send the following event traits or properties as measurement protocol parameters:\n\n| Parameters | RudderStack trait/property |\n| --- | --- |\n| [`sr`](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/protocol/v1/parameters#sr) | `context.screen.width` x `context.screen.height` |\n| [`vp`](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/protocol/v1/parameters#vp) | `context.screen.innerWidth` x `context.screen.innerHeight` |\n| [`ci`](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/protocol/v1/parameters#ci) | `context.campaign.campaignId` |\n| [`gclid`](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/protocol/v1/parameters#gclid) | from externalID `googleAdsId` |\n| [`dclid`](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/protocol/v1/parameters#dclid) | from externalID `googleDisplayAdsId` |\n\nThe following snippet demonstrates how to send `gclid` and `dclid` using `externalId`:\n\n```\n\"externalId\": [{\n    \"type\": \"googleAdsId\",\n    \"id\": \"gclid_value\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"type\": \"googleDisplayAdsId\",\n    \"id\": \"dclid_value\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n### Custom dimensions\n\nYou can configure the [custom dimensions](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/10075209?hl=en) in the [Admin](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6132368?hl=en) page of your Google Analytics dashboard.\n\nThere are multiple scopes for custom dimensions such as `hits`, `session`, `user`, and `products` (if **Enhanced ecommerce** setting is enabled). Once you set these up in Google Analytics, you can map the event traits and properties to the custom dimensions in the RudderStack dashboard.\n\n[![](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/image%20%2859%29.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/image%20%2859%29.webp)\n\nA custom dimension should be set as `dimension{index}`. For example, in the above image, `dimension1` is mapped to the `first_name`, `dimension2` is mapped to `gender`, and so on. The following image highlights the custom dimensions as seen in the Google Analytics dashboard:\n\n[![](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/image%20%2836%29.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/image%20%2836%29.webp)\n\nNote that an `identify` call containing the custom dimensions is recorded after the next `track` or `page` call. An example is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify({\n  gender: 'Female'\n});\n\nrudderanalytics.track('Viewed History');\n```\n\n### Non-interaction events\n\nThe non-interaction parameter (`nonInteraction`) in the events lets you specify the bounce rate for pages in your website that also include event measurement. Refer to the [Non-Interaction Events](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1033068#NonInteractionEvents&zippy=%2Cin-this-article) guide for more information.\n\nIf you enable the **Add the non-interaction flag to all events** setting in the RudderStack dashboard, `nonInteraction` is set to `1`. A sample payload is shown below:\n\n```\n{\n  \"action\": \"track\",\n  \"event\": \"Track Page\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"nonInteraction\": 1\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Named tracker\n\nIf you enable the **Use Named Tracker** setting in RudderStack dashboard, RudderStack pushes the events to a Google Analytics tracker named `rudderGATracker` instead of the default tracker. For more information on creating trackers in Google Analytics, refer to the [Creating Trackers](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/creating-trackers) guide.\n\nIf **Use Named Tracker** setting is disabled, RudderStack sets a default tracker with the name `t0`.\n\n#### Setting multiple trackers\n\nYou can set a second tracker in the `ready()` callback function of the RudderStack SDK. The following snippets show an example of sending events to Google Analytics with another tracking ID:\n\n```\n// without any tracker name\nwindow.rudderanalytics.ready(() => {\n  console.log(\"we are all set!!!\")\n  window.ga(\"create\", \"UA-XXXXXXX-1\", \"auto\")\n  window.ga(\"send\", \"pageview\")\n})\n```\n\n```\n// with a tracker name\nwindow.rudderanalytics.ready(() => {\n  console.log(\"we are all set!!!\")\n  window.ga(\"create\", \"UA-XXXXXXX-1\", \"auto\", {\n    name: \"newTracker\"\n  })\n  window.ga(\"newTracker.send\", \"pageview\")\n})\n```\n\n### Cross-domain-tracking\n\nYou can implement cross-domain tracking by following either of the following approaches:\n\n*   **Tracking visitors with userId**: If the **Send user-id to GA** dashboard setting is enabled, you can send `userId` to uniquely identify a given user. However, this only works for the identified users. RudderStack does not track or maintain the anonymous visitor sessions.\n*   **Tracking Anonymous Visitors**: In this approach, RudderStack automatically enables `allowLinker` - an auto-linking plugin provided by Google Analytics to track cookies and anonymous visitors when users navigate from one page to the other.\n\n### Ignored referrers\n\nFor universal profiles, you can edit the ignored referrers in Google Analytics directly.\n\n### Site search\n\nWhen sending `page` events to Google Analytics, you can enable the **Include the Querystring in Page Views** setting in the RudderStack dashboard to add the search term to the page URL.\n\nAlso, you need to enable the **Site search Tracking** in your Google Analytics account and enter the query parameter. If the query is `abc.com/s=xyz`, the setting should be as follows:\n\n[![](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/image%20%2818%29%20%281%29%20%281%29%20%281%29%20%281%29%20%281%29%20%281%29%20%281%29.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/image%20%2818%29%20%281%29%20%281%29%20%281%29%20%281%29%20%281%29%20%281%29%20%281%29.webp)\n\n### Content groupings\n\nYou can set the [content grouping](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2853423?hl=en) mappings in the RudderStack dashboard using the **Property & Trait Mapping** setting.\n\nThe below image shows the content grouping configuration settings in Google Analytics:\n\n[![](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/image%20%2826%29.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/image%20%2826%29.webp)\n\nWhen you send a `page` call with custom properties, RudderStack uses the property value as the value of the specified content grouping.\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### Where can I find the Google Analytics tracking ID?\n\n1.  In your Google Analytics dashboard, click the **Admin** tab in the bottom left corner and go to **Tracking Info**.\n\n[![Google Analytics tracking ID](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/ga-tracking-id.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/ga-tracking-id.webp)\n\n2.  Click **Tracking Code** to get your Google Analytics tracking ID:\n\n[![Google Analytics tracking ID](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/ga-tracking-id-2.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/ga-tracking-id-2.webp)\n\n#### What are custom metrics and custom dimensions?\n\n**Custom metrics** and **custom dimensions** are fields that let you track custom properties associated with your events using RudderStack.\n\nMetrics are applicable for event properties having a numeric data type while dimensions are used for event properties having string data type. Both are used to track custom data properties in Google Analytics.\n\n#### My website uses HTTPS. Do I need to change any settings for accurate Google Analytics tracking?\n\nIn the **Property Setup**, you need to change the website URL from HTTP (default) to HTTPS:\n\n[![](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/image%20%2849%29.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/image%20%2849%29.webp)\n\n#### Can I view real-time reports of my event data?\n\nYes, you can. Check the **Realtime** reports in Google Analytics. A sample dashboard is shown below:\n\n[![](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/faq2.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/faq2.webp)\n\n#### How do I view the already processed events for a particular day?\n\nTo view the processed events for a particular day, adjust the Google Analytics’ default reporting time frame to the required date.\n\n#### Why are my page views in Google Analytics different when sent from device mode as against cloud mode?\n\nThere could be two reasons for this:\n\n*   There can be adblockers enabled in the user’s browser while visiting your site. This blocks the browser from sending requests directly to Google Analytics.\n    \n*   For cloud mode, RudderStack is not blocked by adblockers presently. If you’re sending the events to Google Analytics via cloud mode, the actual number of events intended to be sent to Google Analytics are forwarded by the RudderStack server.\n    \n    In this scenario, the number of requests in device mode is expected to be lower than in cloud mode.\n    \n\nRudderStack’s JavaScript SDK provides a way of detecting how many page view requests are potentially blocked by the adblockers through your site pages. See [Detecting Ad-blocked Pages](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/detecting-adblocked-pages/) for more information.\n\nQuestions?

You also get SLA obligations, guaranteed uptime, extended support, and more.\n\nRudderStack supports sending real-time customer events to Google Analytics 360.\n\n## Getting started\n\nRudderStack supports sending event data to Google Analytics 360 via the following [connection modes](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/):\n\n| **Connection Mode** | **Web** | **Mobile** | **Server** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Device Mode** | **Supported** | \\-  | \\-  |\n| **Cloud Mode** | **Supported** | **Supported** | **Supported** |\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> In a web device mode integration, that is, using [JavaScript SDK](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/) as a source, the Google Analytics 360 native SDK is loaded from `https://www.google-analytics.com/` domain. Based on your website’s content security policy, you might need to [allowlist this domain](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/load-js-sdk/#allowlist-destination-domain) to load the Google Analytics 360 SDK successfully.\n\nThen, perform the steps below:\n\n*   Choose a source for which you would like to add Google Analytics 360 as a destination.\n*   From the list of destinations, select **Google Analytics 360**. Then, assign a name to the destination and click **Next**.\n*   You should then see the following **Connection Settings** page:\n\n[![](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/1%20%2820%29.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/1%20%2820%29.webp)\n\n[![](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/2%20%2826%29.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/2%20%2826%29.webp)\n\n[![](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/3%20%2823%29.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/3%20%2823%29.webp)\n\n*   **Tracking ID** is a required field to configure the destination. You can configure the other options as per your preference.\n*   To add a transformation, click **Create New Transformation**. Otherwise, click **Next**.\n\n*   The destination is now configured and enabled.\n\n[![](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/final.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/final.webp)\n\nYou can now start sending your real-time events and view them in Google Analytics 360 by going to your Google Analytics 360 dashboard and navigating to **Realtime** - **Events**.\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### Can I anonymize an IP Address in Google Analytics 360?\n\nYes, you can. Turn on the **Anonymize IP Addresses** setting under the **Other Settings** option in the RudderStack dashboard while configuring Google Analytics 360.\n\nThis setting lets Google Analytics anonymize the address at the earliest possible stage of the data collection.\n\nQuestions?

    "markdown": "# Google Analytics 4 Hybrid Mode\n\nSend events to Google Analytics 4 using RudderStack hybrid mode.\n\n* * *\n\n*     2 minute read  \n    \n\nRudderStack’s [hybrid mode](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#hybrid-mode) lets you send your event data to Google Analytics 4 via both the native SDK ([device mode](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#device-mode)) and the Google Analytics 4 Measurement Protocol ([cloud mode](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#cloud-mode)).\n\nTo use GA4 connection in hybrid mode, you can select **Hybrid mode** while [setting up the connection modes](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/google-analytics-4/setup-guide/#connection-mode). This option is available only for the `gtag.js` web SDK.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> We recently updated our Google Analytics 4 hybrid mode destination to support new instrumentation options. See the [release note](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/releases/ga4-hybrid-mode-updates/) for more information.\n\n## Why use hybrid mode?\n\nUnlike GA Universal, GA4’s server-side tracking (cloud mode) is less independent and may require support from client-side tracking (device mode). As noted in Google’s docs, Measurement Protocol is meant to [augment automatic collection](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/protocol/ga4) via gtag, Tag Manager, and Google Analytics, not replace them.\n\nThrough a single hybrid mode deployment, you would have access to a fuller, more unified and accurate set of attribution data with the least impact on performance (resulting from a combination of client-side and server-side tracking).\n\nSpecifically, a hybrid instrumentation may make sense for those who prefer to maintain the benefits of cloud mode—including a faster site, more reliable data collection, and first-party data capture, while also capturing data required for attribution, sessionization, geolocation, and conversions for Google Ads Remarketing.\n\n## How does hybrid mode work?\n\nRudderStack sends `page` calls via device mode and all other calls via cloud mode. The purpose of sending `page` calls via device mode is to capture attribution information (such as UTM parameters) that is only available in device mode.\n\nFurther, RudderStack stitches the `page` call information with the rest of the cloud mode events using Google’s `clientID` and `sessionID`.\n\n[![GA4 hybrid mode](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/ga4-hybrid-mode.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/ga4-hybrid-mode.webp)\n\nQuestions?

    "markdown": "# Google Analytics 4 Cloud Mode\n\nSend events to Google Analytics 4 using RudderStack cloud mode.\n\n* * *\n\n*     13 minute read  \n    \n\nRudderStack lets you send your event data to Google Analytics 4 via [cloud mode](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#cloud-mode) by leveraging the [Google Analytics 4 Measurement Protocol](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/protocol/ga4/reference?client_type=gtag#payload).\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> Google Analytics 4 **does not officially support a complete server-to-server integration**. RudderStack utilizes the [GA4 Measurement Protocol API](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/protocol/ga4/reference?client_type=gtag#payload) for **cloud mode** integration, which **does not currently allow ingestion of UTM parameters** for attribution reporting. This may significantly limit your ability to use certain GA4 reporting features. Refer to the [Google’s documentation](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/protocol/ga4) for more information on these limitations.\n> \n> **For capturing a fuller, more robust set of attribution data while using Measurement Protocol, RudderStack suggests referencing and setting up a [hybrid mode connection](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/google-analytics-4/hybrid-mode/).**\n\nFind the open source transformer code for this destination in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-transformer/tree/master/src/v0/destinations/ga4).\n\n## Tagging methods\n\nRudderStack supports both the `gtag` and `firebase` ways for tagging in websites in cloud mode. However, note that:\n\n*   If you use `gtag`, passing the `client_id` parameter is mandatory.\n*   If you use `firebase`, passing the `app_instance_id` parameter is mandatory.\n\nRefer to the [Google Analytics 4 Measurement Protocol](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/protocol/ga4/reference?client_type=gtag#payload) guide for more information.\n\nThe mappings for the above-mentioned mandatory parameters are listed in the following table:\n\n| Parameters | Mapping value |\n| --- | --- |\n| `client_id` | GA4 requires it to uniquely identify the user instance of a client. See [Mapping `client_id`](#mapping-client_id). |\n| [`app_instance_id`](#how-do-i-obtain-app_instance_id) | from [`externalId`](#externalID) `ga4AppInstanceId` |\n\n#### Mapping `client_id`\n\nRudderStack maps `client_id` from the following fields in the same priority order as listed below:\n\n*   From `externalID`: `ga4ClientId`\n*   From `anonymousId`\n*   From `rudderId`\n\n#### `externalId`\n\nYou can use `externalID` to send a custom `client_id` that is external to RudderStack.\n\nThere are certain scenarios where you may want to send a custom `client_id`. For example, if you maintain a user with a certain identifier, then you may prefer to pass it as the custom `client_id` as a part of `externalId`:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify(\n  \"1hKOmRA4GRlm\", {\n    firstName: \"Alex\",\n    city: \"New Orleans\",\n    country: \"Louisiana\",\n    phone: \"+1-202-555-0146\",\n    email: \"alex@example.com\",\n  } {\n    externalId: [{\n      id: \"4718026.1683606287\",\n      type: \"ga4ClientId\",\n    }, ],\n  }\n);\n```\n\n### Supported mappings\n\nThe following table lists the mappings for the `gtag` and `firebase` parameters:\n\n| Parameters | Mapping | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `user_id` | `userId`  <br>`traits.userId`  <br>`traits.id`  <br>`context.traits.userId`  <br>`context.traits.id` | Unique identifier for a user which helps Google Analytics 4 know if two devices/browsers belong to the same user. |\n| `timestamp_micros` | `originalTimestamp`  <br>`timestamp` | Timestamp in ISO 8601 format. |\n| `non_personalized_ads` | `context.device.adTrackingEnabled` | Indicates whether the events should be used for personalized ads. If `context.device.adTrackingEnabled` is set as `true`, `non_personalised_ads` will be set to `false`. |\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Google Analytics 4 Measurement Protocol only supports timestamps 72 hours into the past and 15 minutes into the future. RudderStack discards any event with a timestamp out of this range.\n\n## Track\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> You can use a `track` call to send any event to Google Analytics 4. However, you can use the `page` call to record page-related information for your website specifically.\n\nThe [`track`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/track/) call lets you capture user events along with the properties associated with them.\n\nYou can send all the events mentioned in [GA4 documentation](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/protocol/ga4/reference/events) as track events.\n\nA sample `track` call using `gtag` is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track('Product List Viewed', {\n  list_id: \"related_products\",\n  category: \"Related_products\",\n  products: [{\n    product_id: \"507f1f77bcf86cd799439011\",\n    name: \"Monopoly: 3rd Edition\",\n    coupon: \"SUMMER_FUN\",\n    category: \"Apparel\",\n    brand: \"Google\",\n    variant: \"green\",\n    price: \"19\",\n    quantity: \"2\",\n    position: \"1\",\n    affiliation: \"Google Merchandise Store\",\n    currency: \"USD\",\n    discount: 2.22,\n    item_category2: \"Adult\",\n    item_category3: \"Shirts\",\n    item_category4: \"Crew\",\n    item_category5: \"Short sleeve\",\n    item_list_id: \"related_products\",\n    item_list_name: \"Related Products\",\n    location_id: \"L_12345\"\n  }]\n}, {\n    externalId: [{\n        type: \"ga4ClientId\",\n        id: \"client_id\"\n    }],\n});\n```\n\nA sample `track` call using `firebase` is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track('Product List Viewed', {\n  list_id: \"related_products\",\n  category: \"Related_products\",\n  products: [{\n    product_id: \"507f1f77bcf86cd799439011\",\n    name: \"Monopoly: 3rd Edition\",\n    coupon: \"SUMMER_FUN\",\n    category: \"Apparel\",\n    brand: \"Google\",\n    variant: \"green\",\n    price: \"19\",\n    quantity: \"2\",\n    position: \"1\",\n    affiliation: \"Google Merchandise Store\",\n    currency: \"USD\",\n    discount: 2.22,\n    item_category2: \"Adult\",\n    item_category3: \"Shirts\",\n    item_category4: \"Crew\",\n    item_category5: \"Short sleeve\",\n    item_list_id: \"related_products\",\n    item_list_name: \"Related Products\",\n    location_id: \"L_12345\"\n  }]\n}, {\n  externalId: [{\n    type: \"ga4AppInstanceId\",\n    id: \"f0dd99b6f979fb551ce583373900f937\"\n  }],\n});\n```\n\n### Supported mappings\n\nThe following table lists the property mappings between RudderStack and Google Analytics 4 for `login` and `sign_up` events:\n\n| RudderStack property | Google Analytics 4 property | Default value |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `traits.method`  <br>`properties.method` | `method` | \\-  |\n| `traits.engagementTimeMsec`  <br>`properties.engagementTimeMsec`  <br>`context.traits.engagementTimeMsec`  <br>`traits.engagement_time_msec`  <br>`properties.engagement_time_msec`  <br>`context.traits.engagement_time_msec` | `engagement_time_msec` | `1` |\n\nThe following table lists the property mappings between RudderStack and Google Analytics 4 for `generate_lead` event:\n\n| RudderStack property | Google Analytics 4 property | Default value |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `properties.currency` | `currency` | USD |\n| `properties.total`  <br>`properties.price`  <br>`properties.value`  <br>`properties.revenue`  <br>Required | `value` | \\-  |\n| `traits.engagementTimeMsec`  <br>`properties.engagementTimeMsec`  <br>`context.traits.engagementTimeMsec`  <br>`traits.engagement_time_msec`  <br>`properties.engagement_time_msec`  <br>`context.traits.engagement_time_msec` | `engagement_time_msec` | `1` |\n\n## Page\n\nThe [`page`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/page/) call lets you record your website’s page views with any additional relevant information about the viewed page.\n\nRudderStack maps the `page` call to a `page_view` event by default, and passes it to Google Analytics 4 as a custom event.\n\nAs mentioned in the [`track`](#track) section, the RudderStack cloud mode supports both the `gtag` and `firebase` methods for tagging in websites.\n\nA sample `page` call using `gtag` is shown below:\n\nA sample `page` call using `firebase` is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.page({}, {\n  externalId: [{\n    type: \"ga4AppInstanceId\",\n    id: \"f0dd99b6f979fb551ce583373900f937\"\n  }],\n});\n```\n\n### Supported mappings\n\nThe following table lists the property mappings between RudderStack and Google Analytics 4:\n\n| RudderStack property | Google Analytics 4 property |\n| --- | --- |\n| `context.page.referrer` | `page_referrer` |\n| `context.page.title` | `page_title` |\n| `context.page.url` | `page_location` |\n\n## Group\n\nThe [`group`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/group/) call lets you link an identified user with a group such as a company, organization, or an account, and record any traits associated with that group, for example, company name, number of employees, etc.\n\nRudderStack maps the `group` call to the `join_group` event by default.\n\nA sample `group` call using `gtag` is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.group(\"1hKOmRA4\", {\n    \"custom1\": 1234,\n    \"custom2\": \"custom2\"\n});\n```\n\nA sample `group` call using `firebase` is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.group(\"1hKOmRA4\", {\n    \"custom1\": 1234,\n    \"custom2\": \"custom2\"\n}, {\n    externalId: [{\n        type: \"ga4AppInstanceId\",\n        id: \"f0dd99b6f979fb551ce583373900f937\"\n    }],\n});\n```\n\n## Ecommerce event tracking\n\nRudderStack supports ecommerce tracking for Google Analytics 4. You can refer to the [Ecommerce Events Specification](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/ecommerce-events-spec/) for sending events while instrumenting your site with the RudderStack SDK.\n\n### Supported mappings\n\nEvent mappings  \n\n| RudderStack event | Google Analytics 4 event |\n| --- | --- |\n| Products Searched | `search` |\n| Product List Viewed | `view_item_list` |\n|

properties:\n\n| Event Mapping |     | Property Mapping |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| RudderStack | Google Analytics 4 | RudderStack | Google Analytics 4 |\n| `generate_lead` | `generate_lead` | `properties.${currency}`  <br>`properties.${value}` | `currency`  <br>`value` |\n| `login` | `login` | `properties.${method}` | `method` |\n| `sign_up` | `sign_up` | `properties.${method}` | `method` |\n| `view_search_results` | `view_search_results` | `properties.search_term` | `search_term` |\n| `Campaign Details`  <br>`campaign_details` | `campaign_details` | `context.campaign.id`  <br>`properties.campaign.id` | `campaign_id` |\n| `context.campaign.name`  <br>`properties.campaign.name` | `campaign` |\n| `context.campaign.source`  <br>`properties.campaign.source` | `source` |\n| `context.campaign.medium`  <br>`properties.campaign.medium` | `medium` |\n| `context.campaign.term`  <br>`properties.campaign.term` | `term` |\n| `context.campaign.content`  <br>`properties.campaign.content` | `content` |\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> You can pass the custom user properties to any of the events by passing them as `properties.user_properties` or `context.traits`. Refer to the [Google Analytics 4 documentation](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/protocol/ga4/user-properties?client_type=gtag) for more information.\n\n## Custom events\n\nYou can use [custom events](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/12229021?hl=en) to collect additional information that Google Analytics 4 does not collect automatically.\n\nFollow the below rules while choosing a name for the custom events and parameters:\n\n*   Event names are case-sensitive. For example, `my_event` and `My_Event` are two distinct events.\n*   Event names must start with a letter. Only letters, numbers, and underscores are permitted. **Do not** use spaces.\n*   Do not use [reserved prefixes and event names](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/13316687?sjid=15936425803368383083-AP#zippy=). The list of such prefixes is mentioned below:\n    *   \\_ (underscore)\n    *   firebase\\_\n    *   ga\\_\n    *   google\\_\n    *   gtag.\n*   **Do not** use spaces in event parameter names.\n\n## Custom dimensions and metrics\n\nBefore sending events to Google Analytics 4, you must create [custom dimensions and metrics](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/10075209) in your GA4 dashboard and link them to the event properties/parameters.\n\nYou can select a parameter from the list of already collected properties or specify the parameter you plan to collect in the future. RudderStack supports sending user properties via `properties.user_properties` and `context.traits`.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Note that:\n> \n> *   Custom dimensions can be either event-scoped or user-scoped. However, custom metrics **must** be event-scoped.\n> *   Each user property should either be of a number, string, or Boolean data type. This is because GA4 accepts only flat key-value pairs as user properties.\n> *   RudderStack drops any user property that is either an object or an array.\n\n## Tracking active users and sessions\n\nAs Google Analytics 4 only reports the users who engage with your website for a non-zero time, RudderStack sets the `engagement_time_msec` parameter to 1, by default. To track engagement time in your events, you can set the `engagement_time_msec` field to a different value.\n\nRudderStack maps the following properties to GA4’s `engagement_time_msec` property:\n\n| RudderStack properties | Google Analytics 4 property |\n| --- | --- |\n| `traits.engagementTimeMsec`  <br>`context.traits.engagementTimeMsec`  <br>`traits.engagement_time_msec`  <br>`context.traits.engagement_time_msec` | `engagement_time_msec` |\n\nYou can use the Google Analytics 4 `session_id` parameter to identify the session associated with a particular event. To know more about sessions in Google Analytics 4, see [Google Analytics 4 help article](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9191807?hl=en#zippy=).\n\nRudderStack maps the following session properties for the `group` call:\n\n| RudderStack properties | Google Analytics 4 property |\n| --- | --- |\n| `traits.sessionId`  <br>`context.traits.sessionId`  <br>`traits.session_id`  <br>`context.traits.session_id`  <br>`context.sessionId` | `session_id` |\n\nRudderStack maps the following session properties for the `track` and `page` calls:\n\n| RudderStack properties | Google Analytics 4 property |\n| --- | --- |\n| `properties.sessionId`  <br>`properties.session_id`  <br>`context.sessionId` | `session_id` |\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack automatically collects `engagement_time_msec` and `session_id` when sending events via [device mode](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/google-analytics-4/device-mode/). However, they must be manually passed while sending events via cloud mode.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Server-side session tracking supports only a subset of user dimensions. Google’s Measurement Protocol API does not support the reserved fields like location, demographics, [predefined user dimensions](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9268042?hl=en&ref_topic=11151952), and device-specific information.\n\nSee [Google Analytics 4 documentation](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/protocol/ga4/sending-events?client_type=firebase#optional_parameters_for_reports) for more information on the optional reporting parameters.\n\n## View events in GA4\n\nTo verify if your events are sent to GA4 successfully, go to **Reports** > **Realtime** in your Google Analytics dashboard or check [Debug View](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/google-analytics-4/device-mode/#debug-mode) (only available in device mode). For more information, see [GA4 documentation](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9333790) for more information.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> It can take **up to 24 hours** for the data to be processed in GA4 and appear in the other reports.\n\n#### Events not showing in GA4\n\nIf your events do not show up in GA4’s **Realtime** view, there could be issues with your implementation. See [GA4 documentation](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/protocol/ga4/verify-implementation?client_type=gtag#realtime) for more information on verifying your implementation or checking the realtime view.\n\nYou can also see the GA4 [Troubleshooting guide](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/protocol/ga4/troubleshooting?client_type=gtag) for steps on identifying and fixing any possible implementation issues.\n\nAlso, make sure you are not using a reserved name for your events. This is a common reason for events not showing up in GA4. See [FAQ](#faq) for more information on reserved event names.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> Not all types of data flow through to GA4’s **Realtime** dashboard. For example, the Measurement Protocol does not support geolocation data and it does not show up in the Realtime dashboard (except for `page` calls sent via hybrid mode).\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### What does the (not set) value mean in reports?\n\nIf you see (not set) value in your reports, see [GA4 documentation](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/13504892?hl=en#zippy=%2Cin-this-article) to diagnose the cause first.\n\nRudderStack utilizes the GA4 Measurement Protocol API for cloud mode integration. It does not support ingestion of UTM parameters for attribution reporting currently.\n\nSome other probable reasons could be:\n\n**Reserved event, parameter, and user property names in Google Analytics 4**  \nGoogle Analytics 4 has some reserved event, parameter, and user property names that cannot be used. If passed, they are dropped silently. See [Measurement Protocol (Google Analytics 4)](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/protocol/ga4/reference?client_type=gtag#reserved_names) for a complete list of reserved names. Also, note that Google does not accept any event/user property names that include spaces or fields that include null values.\n\n**DebugView**  \n[DebugView](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/7201382?hl=en) is only supported in the device mode and is enabled automatically when you set up a device mode GA4 connection. For cloud mode connections, RudderStack sends the events to the [validation server](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/protocol/ga4/validating-events?client_type=gtag) and they do not show up in reports.\n\n**Validating events**  \nThe Google Analytics Measurement Protocol for Google Analytics 4 does not return `HTTP` error codes, even if an event is malformed or missing required parameters. To ensure your events are valid, you should test them against the Measurement Protocol Validation Server before deploying them to production. See [Validating events](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/protocol/ga4/validating-events?client_type=gtag) for more information.\n\n#### How do I obtain `app_instance_id`?\n\nYou can retrieve `app_instance_id` through the Firebase SDK depending on the platform where the SDK is installed:\n\n*   [Android: `getAppInstanceId()`](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/android/com/google/firebase/analytics/FirebaseAnalytics#public-taskstring-getappinstanceid)\n*   [Kotlin: `getAppInstanceId()`](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/kotlin/com/google/firebase/analytics/FirebaseAnalytics#getappinstanceid)\n*   [Swift: `appInstanceID()`](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/swift/firebaseanalytics/api/reference/Classes/Analytics#appinstanceid)\n*   [Objective-C: `appInstanceID`](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/ios/firebaseanalytics/api/reference/Classes/FIRAnalytics#+appinstanceid)\n*   [C++: `GetAnalyticsInstanceId()`](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/cpp/namespace/firebase/analytics#getanalyticsinstanceid)\n*   [Unity: `GetAnalyticsInstanceIdAsync()`](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/unity/class/firebase/analytics/firebase-analytics#getanalyticsinstanceidasync)\n\nSee [GA4 documentation](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/protocol/ga4/reference?client_type=firebase#payload_post_body) for more information.\n\nQuestions?

    "markdown": "# Google Analytics 4 Device Mode\n\nSend events to Google Analytics 4 using RudderStack web device mode.\n\n* * *\n\n*     4 minute read  \n    \n\nRudderStack lets you send your event data to Google Analytics 4 destination via [device mode](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#device-mode) using the native web SDK, using the `gtag` tagging method.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> You need to select `gtag.js` as the **Client Type** and enable **Use device-mode to send events** in the RudderStack dashboard to send events via device mode. For more information on device mode settings in the RudderStack dashboard, see [Setting up Google Analytics 4](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/google-analytics-4/setup-guide/) guide.\n\nFind the open source JavaScript SDK code for this destination in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-sdk-js/tree/production/src/integrations/GA4).\n\n## Identify\n\nThe [`identify`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/identify/) call lets you identify a visiting user and associate them to their actions. It also lets you record the traits about them like their name, email address, etc.\n\nUser-ID is an advanced feature that lets GA4 present a cross-device, cross-platform view of your customers’ behavior. Google Analytics 4 uses `userId` and `deviceId` (GA’s `cid` value from Universal Analytics terminology) to identify users.\n\nA sample `identify` call is as shown:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify(\"1hKOmRA4el9Zt1WSfVJIVo4GRlm\", {\n  name: \"Alex Keener\",\n  email: \"alex@example.com\",\n})\n```\n\nIn the above snippet, the `userId` is set to `1hKOmRA4el9Zt1WSfVJIVo4GRlm` and the `name` and `email` is set as `user_properties`.\n\n## Page\n\nThe [`page`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/page/) call lets you record your website’s page views with any additional relevant information about the viewed page.\n\nGoogle Analytics 4 `gtag` sends a `page_view` event to Google Analytics by default every-time it is loaded. You can also send `page_view` event to Google Analytics whenever you make an explicit `page()` call to RudderStack SDK.\n\nRudderStack sends the following properties by default:\n\n*   `url` mapped to `page_location`\n*   `title` mapped to `page_title`\n*   `referrer` mapped to `page_referrer`\n\nYou can also make `page()` call with any custom and standard properties as shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.page({\n  path: \"/test_browser.html\",\n  url: \"http://example.com/test_browser.html?param1=true\",\n  title: \"Page Load\",\n  search: \"?param1=true\",\n  referrer: \"referrer\",\n})\n```\n\n## Track\n\nThe [`track`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/track/) call lets you capture user events along with the properties associated with them.\n\nA sample `track` call is as shown:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"Track me\")\n```\n\nRudderStack SDK sends the track event name and any properties as custom properties to Google Analytics 4.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack SDK flattens the properties that are nested and not standard Google Analytics 4 properties before sending them to Google Analytics.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> There are limits on the number of custom properties per event that can be sent to Google Analytics 4. The RudderStack SDK **does not drop** the payload based on these limits. If the events are don’t show up in the debug view or in the Google Analytics dashboard reports, refer to the [Google support page](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9267744?hl=en) to learn more about the collection limits.\n\n## Group\n\nThe [`group`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/group/) call lets you link an identified user with a group such as a company, organization, or an account, and record any traits associated with that group, for example, company name, number of employees, etc.\n\nRudderStack maps the `group` call to the `join_group` event by default.\n\nA sample `group` call is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.group(\"1hKOmRA4\", {\n    \"custom1\": 1234,\n    \"custom2\": \"custom2\"\n});\n```\n\n## Ecommerce events tracking\n\nRudderStack supports ecommerce tracking for Google Analytics 4. Use the [Ecommerce Events Specification](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/ecommerce-events-spec/) for sending events while instrumenting your site with the RudderStack SDK.\n\nBelow are some examples of the track event names that are passed to Google Analytics 4-specific ecommerce event name:\n\n| RudderStack event name | Google Analytics 4 event name |\n| --- | --- |\n| Products Searched | `search` |\n| Product List Viewed | `view_item_list` |\n| Promotion Viewed | `view_promotion` |\n| Product Clicked | `select_item` |\n| Product Added To Wishlist | `add_to_wishlist` |\n| Product Added | `add_to_cart` |\n| Cart Shared | `share` |\n| Checkout Started | `begin_checkout` |\n| Order Completed | `purchase` |\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> For each product in the order, there must be an `id` and `name` associated with it. Refer to the [GA4 documentation](https://developers.google.com/gtagjs/reference/ga4-events#view_item_list) for more information on ecommerce events and corresponding properties.\n\n## Debug mode\n\nRudderStack sends all the device mode events with a `debug_mode` parameter so that you can view them in the [DebugView](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/7201382).\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### How can I disable sending `userId` to GA4?\n\nYou can disable sending `userId` to GA4 by [passing an `integrations` object](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/filtering/) in your JavaScript SDK load options and setting `sendUserId` to `false`.\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.load(\n  \"WRITE_KEY\",\n  \"DATA_PLANE_URL\", {\n    integrations: {\n      All: true,\n      \"Google Analytics 4\": {\n        sendUserId: false\n      },\n    }\n  }\n)\n```\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> If you set `sendUserId` to `false`, RudderStack will not send `userId` to GA4 in any of the events.\n\n#### How can I enable Google Signals in GA4?\n\n[Google Signals](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9445345?hl=en#zippy=%2Cin-this-article) helps you understand the interaction of users with your website across multiple devices and sessions. To enable Google Signals and capture user data, the following conditions must be met:\n\n*   A user must be signed in to their Google Account on the website or app.\n*   Ad Personalization must be enabled for their account.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> The Google Signals feature is available in the web [device mode](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#device-mode) only.\n\nTo enable Google Signals in GA4 and reflect the collected user data in your reports, follow the steps below:\n\n1.  Log into your [Google Analytics dashboard](https://analytics.google.com/).\n    \n2.  Open the Admin panel by clicking on the gear icon at the bottom left.\n    \n    [![Google Signals](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/Google-signals-1.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/Google-signals-1.webp)\n    \n3.  Select the property for which you want to enable Google Signals. Then, go to **Data Settings** > **Data Collection**.\n    \n4.

    "markdown": "# Google Pub/Sub | RudderStack Docs\n\nSend your event data from RudderStack to Google Pub/Sub.\n\n* * *\n\n*     5 minute read  \n    \n\n[Google Pub/Sub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/overview) is an asynchronous messaging service that allows you to decouple the services that produce events from the services that process events. With Pub/Sub, you get durable message storage as well as a real-time message delivery system. The Google Pub/Sub servers run reliably with a consistent performance in all Google Cloud regions over the world.\n\nRudderStack allows you to configure Google Pub/Sub as a destination and send your event data to it directly.\n\n## Getting started\n\nTo enable sending data to Google Pub/Sub, you will first need to add it as a destination to the source from which you are sending your event data. Once the destination is enabled, events from our SDK will start flowing to Google Pub/Sub.\n\n| **Connection Mode** | **Web** | **Mobile** | **Server** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Device mode | **\\-** | **\\-** | **\\-** |\n| Cloud mode | **Supported** | **Supported** | **Supported** |\n\nOnce you have confirmed that the platform supports sending events to Google Pub/Sub, perform the steps below:\n\n*   From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderlabs.com/), add the source. From the list of destinations, select **Google Pub/Sub.**\n*   Give a name to the destination and click **Next**. You should then see the following screen:\n\n[![](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/image%20%2879%29%20%282%29%20%282%29%20%283%29%20%283%29%20%283%29%20%282%29%20%282%29.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/image%20%2879%29%20%282%29%20%282%29%20%283%29%20%283%29%20%283%29%20%282%29%20%282%29.webp)\n\nGoogle Pub/Sub Connection Settings\n\n*   Enter the following details:\n    *   **Connection Settings**\n        *   **Project ID** and the **Credentials**: Follow these steps to obtain the project ID as well as the required credentials:\n            *   Create a service account from Google Cloud Console.\n            *   You can get the **Project ID** when you log in to your Google Cloud Console.\n            *   Use the **Select a role** dropdown to add the **Pub/Sub Publisher** role.\n            *   Create a key as JSON and download it.\n            *   Paste this downloaded JSON in the **Credentials** field\n        *   Enter the **Event Name** as well as the corresponding **Topic ID**. You can get the topic id from your topics page:\n\n[![](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/image%20%2848%29.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/image%20%2848%29.webp)\n\nGoogle Pub/Sub Topic ID and Name\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> You can send an event `type` like `page,` `identify,` `track`. For the `track` events you can specify the event name based on the `event` name in the payload.\n> \n> For example:\n> \n> *   If the event name is `page` it will send all calls with the `type` page.\n> *   If the event name is `product added` , it will send all track events with the `event` as `product added`.\n\n> ![success](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/tick.svg)\n> \n> If you want to send all events to a particular stream irrespective of the type or name, you can use `*` as the event name.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> The **topic ID** is **case-sensitive** and has to be exactly as seen in Google Pub/Sub. On the other hand, the **event name** is **case insensitive**, and thus `Page` or `page` will both be considered as valid.\n\n*   Finally, click **Next** to complete the configuration. Pub/Sub should now be added and enabled as a destination in RudderStack.\n\n## Attributes\n\nYou can send attributes to Google Pub/Sub along with the message. In order to send the attributes, enter the required attribute mapping in the RudderStack dashboard as seen below:\n\n[![](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/image%20%28113%29.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/image%20%28113%29.webp)\n\nThe following are some examples:\n\n*   If the `event` is **`Product Viewed`** and the `key` is **`coupon`**, RudderStack will add the `coupon` key-value pair from the message to the attributes’ metadata object.\n*   If multiple mappings are provided for **`Product Viewed`**, all such key-value pairs from the message body will be added to attributes’ metadata object.\n*   If the event name is **`page`** it will send all calls with the `type` page.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> For the `key` fields provided in the attributes map, the `key` is searched in the message body in `root`, `properties`, `traits` and `context.traits` - in that specific order.\n\n**Note: You can also specify the key path in the payload using the dot notation.**\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"Track me\", {\n  category: \"category\",\n  label: \"label\",\n  value: \"value\",\n  metadata: {\n    metadataId: \"sample-id\"\n  }\n});\n```\n\nFor the above `track` call, you can specify an attribute mapping for `metadataID` as shown below:\n\n| **Event** | **Field** |\n| --- | --- |\n| Track me | `metadata.metadataId` |\n\nThis will create the below attribute metadata object:\n\n```\n{\n   metadataId: \"sample-id\"\n}\n```\n\n## Page\n\nThe `page` call contains information related to the page, such as the URL of the web page visited by the user.\n\nA sample `page` payload is as shown in the snippet below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.page({\n  path: \"path\",\n  url: \"url\",\n  title: \"title\",\n  search: \"search\",\n  referrer: \"referrer\",\n})\n```\n\n## Identify\n\nThe `identify` call captures the relevant details about the visiting user.\n\nA sample `identify` payload is as shown in the snippet below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify(\"abc123\", {\n  name: \"FirstName LastName\",\n  email: \"example@gmail.com\",\n})\n```\n\n## Track\n\nThe `track` call captures the information related to the actions performed by the user, along with their properties, or traits.\n\nA sample `track` payload is as shown in the snippet below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"Track me\", {\n  category: \"category\",\n  label: \"label\",\n  value: \"value\",\n})\n```\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### How does event mapping work with the topic ID?\n\n*   If there is no topic ID set for an event, it will not be sent.\n*   If an event is set with a topic id, the payload will be sent to Pub/Sub to that particular topic id.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> If you have set all event type, event and `*` for mapping the priority will be given to `event` , then `type` , followed by `*`.\n\nFor example, let the type of event be `track`, the event name be `product added`. The mapping is done as:\n\n[![](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/screenshot-2020-09-09-at-6.56.02-pm.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/screenshot-2020-09-09-at-6.56.02-pm.webp)\n\nNow all events should go to the topic mapped with **`product added`**.\n\n#### How do I provide multiple Attribute mapping for a particular event?\n\nIn order to send multiple attribute keys for a particular event, enter the required mappings in the RudderStack dashboard as seen below:\n\n[![](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/image%20%28112%29.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/image%20%28112%29.webp)\n\nQuestions?

Choose key type as JSON. This will cause a JSON key file to be downloaded.\n\n## Configuring Google Cloud Storage in RudderStack\n\nIn order to enable sending data to Google Cloud Storage, you will first need to add it as a destination to the source from which you are sending event data. Once the destination is enabled, events from RudderStack will start to flow to Google Cloud Storage.\n\nTo do so, please follow these steps:\n\n*   Choose a source to which you would like to add Google Cloud Storage as a destination. You can also create the destination first, and connect it to a source later.\n*   Once you have set up the source, select **Google Cloud Storage** from the list of destinations. Give your destination a name, and then click **Next**. You will then see the following **Connection Settings** screen:\n\n[![](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/image%20%2814%29%20%281%29.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/image%20%2814%29%20%281%29.webp)\n\nConnection settings for Google Cloud Storage in RudderStack\n\n*   Enter your **Google Cloud Storage Bucket Name**, as well as the content of the JSON key file (refer to the [Setting up Google Cloud Storage](#setting-up-google-cloud-storage) section above) in the **Credentials** field.\n*   If you need any transformation choose one from the list.

Otherwise, it creates a new contact.\n\nA sample `identify` call is as shown:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify({\n  firstName: \"Alex\",\n  city: \"New Orleans\",\n  country: \"USA\",\n  phone: \"+1-202-555-0146\",\n  email: \"alex@example.com\",\n  custom_flavor: \"chocolate\",\n  custom_date: 1574769933368,\n  custom_date1: new Date(\"2019-10-14T11:15:53.296Z\"),\n})\n```\n\nThe lookup field passed in the **Hubspot property name to be used as lookup field** dashboard setting must also be passed in the `traits` object of the `identify` call containing the lookup value.\n\nA sample snippet is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify({\n  name: \"Alex Keener\",\n  phone: \"+1-202-555-0146\",\n  traits: {\n    \"lookupField\": \"alex@example.com\",\n  },\n})\n```\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> If you pass a lookup field in the dashboard setting but not under the `identify` call’s `traits`, RudderStack will take `email` as the default lookup field.\n\n## Track\n\nA [`track`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/track/) call lets you record various user actions and any properties associated with them.\n\nTo associate a `track` call with a user, you need to specify the user’s `email` under `context.traits`.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack associates the `track` events with the same user only after you make a successful `identify` call. However, if you send a `track` call without making any `identify` call first and there is no contact present in HubSpot, RudderStack will not associate the events as there is no identifier.\n\nA sample `track` event is as shown:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\n  \"Order Completed\", {\n    value: 30,\n  }, {\n    context: {\n      traits: {\n        firstname: \"Alex\",\n        city: \"New Orleans\",\n        country: \"USA\",\n        phone: \"+1-202-555-0146\",\n        email: \"alex@example.com\",\n      },\n    },\n  }\n)\n```\n\n### Property mappings\n\nThe following table lists the properties and their mappings between RudderStack and HubSpot for the `track` call:\n\n| RudderStack property | HubSpot property |\n| --- | --- |\n| `traits.utk`/`context.traits.utk`/`properties.utk` | `utk` |\n| `traits.email`/ `context.traits.email` | `email` |\n| `traits.objectId`/`context.traits.objectId`/`properties.objectId` | `objectId` |\n| `properties.occurred_at`/`timestamp`/`originalTimestamp` | `occurredAt` |\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> You must send either of the `utk`, `email`, or `objectId` (can be `contact_id` or `visitor_ id`) properties to make a `track` call successfully.\n\n### Custom behavioral events\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> The custom behavorial events can be used for both the authentication types. However, they must have the `analytics.behavioral_events.send` permission to be used for private apps.\n\n[Custom behavioral events](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/api/analytics/events) are account-defined events in HubSpot that store event details in the event properties. You can create custom behavioral events and their associated properties in the RudderStack dashboard as explained in the [New API](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/hubspot/setting-up-hubspot-in-rudderstack/#new-api) section.\n\nThe following parameters are sent in the custom behavorial events:\n\n*   **Identifier**: Either the contact ID, email, or [utk](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/api/events/tracking-code) (user token) of the contact associated with the event. The utk is the user token stored in the visitor’s `hubspotutk` browser cookie.\n*   **Event name:** The internal name of the event which can be found in HubSpot.\n*   **Properties object**: When you create a custom behavioral event in HubSpot, some default properties are provided with those events, explained in the below section.\n\n#### Property mappings\n\nThe following table lists the **optional** and default property mappings between RudderStack and HubSpot for custom behavioral events:\n\n| RudderStack property | HubSpot property |\n| --- | --- |\n| `properties.assetDescription`/`properties.hsAssetDescription` | `hs_asset_description` |\n| `properties.assetType`/`properties.hsAssetType` | `hs_asset_type` |\n| `properties.campaignId` | `hs_campaign_id` |\n| `traits.address.city`/`context.traits.address.city`/`properties.address.city` | `hs_city` |\n| `traits.address.country`/`context.traits.address.country`/`properties.address.country` | `hs_country` |\n| `context.device.name` | `hs_device_name` |\n| `properties.elementClass`/`properties.hsElementClass` | `hs_element_class` |\n| `properties.elementId`/`properties.hsElementId` | `hs_element_id` |\n\nQuestions?

These properties will update the `contact` property you have **already created** in HubSpot:\n\n[![HubSpot create property](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/hubspot-create-property.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/hubspot-create-property.webp)\n\nWhen you provide any custom property in the event, RudderStack automatically converts the field name into the lower case and replaces any space with an underscore. This is because HubSpot does not accept properties in the upper case and spaces.\n\nRudderStack then maps the field values present in the `traits` to the corresponding HubSpot custom property.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> HubSpot discards any property that does not exist and returns a **400 Bad Request** error.\n\n### Dates\n\nFor sending properties of `date` type, you can send them as the [epoch time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) or as a `date` object. RudderStack converts them to the required HubSpot format (midnight UTC).\n\n## Track\n\nA [`track`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/track/) call lets you record various user actions and any properties associated with them.\n\nTo associate a `track` call with a user, you need to specify the user’s `email` under `context.traits` . Additionally, RudderStack associates the `track` events with the same user after an `identify` request is successfully made.\n\nA sample `track` event is as shown:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\n  \"Order Completed\", {\n    value: 30,\n  }, {\n    context: {\n      traits: {\n        firstname: \"Alex\",\n        city: \"New Orleans\",\n        country: \"USA\",\n        phone: \"+1-202-555-0146\",\n        email: \"alex@example.com\",\n      },\n    },\n  }\n)\n```\n\nThe `track` call also supports [`externalId`](https://legacydocs.hubspot.com/docs/methods/enterprise_events/http_api#:~:text=%26favorite_color%3Dorange-,External%20id,-%26id%3D%7Bvalue%7D) as a parameter which is mapped from `externalID` `hubspotId`. A sample `track` call containing the `externalId` is as shown:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\n  \"Order Completed\", {\n  value: 30,\n}, {\n  context: {\n    traits: {\n      firstname: \"Alex\",\n      city: \"New Orleans\",\n      country: \"USA\",\n      phone: \"+1-202-555-0146\",\n      email: \"alex@example.com\",\n    },\n  },\n  externalId: [{\n    type: \"hubspotId\",\n    id: \"6556\"\n  }]\n})\n```\n\n### Revenue events\n\nFor the revenue events, a `value` or `revenue` key should be included in the event properties to be recorded in HubSpot.\n\n## Screen\n\nThe [`screen`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/screen/) call lets you record whenever your user views their mobile screen, with any additional information about the viewed screen.\n\nIf you have enabled screen views in your [Android](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-android-sdk/) or [iOS](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-ios-sdk/) app implementation, RudderStack will send this information to HubSpot. RudderStack also forwards the `properties` you’ve passed along with the `screen` call without any changes.\n\nA sample `screen` call sent via the iOS SDK is shown below:\n\n```\n[[RSClient sharedInstance] screen:@\"Main\"\n            properties:@{@\"prop_key\" : @\"prop_value\"}];\n```\n\nQuestions?

    "markdown": "# Kochava | RudderStack Docs\n\nSend your event data from RudderStack to Kochava.\n\n* * *\n\n*     6 minute read  \n    \n\n[Kochava](https://www.kochava.com/) is a leading mobile measurement and app analytics platform that offers unique dynamic deep linking, audience segmenting and data accessibility features for your business.\n\nFind the open source transformer code for this destination in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-transformer/tree/master/src/v0/destinations/kochava).\n\n## Getting started\n\nRudderStack supports sending event data to Kochava via the following [connection modes](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/):\n\n| Connection Mode | Web | Mobile | Server |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Device mode** | \\-  | **Supported** | \\-  |\n| **Cloud mode** | **Supported** | **Supported** | \\-  |\n\nOnce you have confirmed that the source platform supports sending events to Kochava, follow these steps:\n\n1.  From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add a source. Then, from the list of destinations, select **Kochava**.\n2.  Assign a name to the destination and click **Continue**.\n\n## Connection settings\n\nTo successfully configure Kochava as a destination, you will need to configure the following settings:\n\n*   **App GUID**: Kochava generates a unique ID for your application called the **App GUID**. You can find this ID by going to your Kochava account and navigating to **Apps & Assets** > **All Apps**. You can then select your app to the view the App GUID.\n\nThe following two settings are applicable for iOS device mode only:\n\n*   **Enable AppTrackingTransparency (ATT)**: Enable this setting if you want to enable the `AppTrackingTransparency` feature provided by the Kochava iOS SDK.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Make sure to include the key `NSUserTrackingUsageDescription` in your `info.plist` along with a string value explaining why you are requesting authorization to track.\n\n*   **Enable skAdNetwork**: Enable this setting if you want to enable the `skAdNetwork` feature provided by the Kochava iOS SDK.\n\n## Adding device mode integration\n\nTo add Kochava to your Android project and enable functionalities like push notifications, follow these steps :\n\n1.  Open your project level `build.gradle` file, and add the following:\n\n```\nbuildscript {\n    repositories {\n        mavenCentral()\n    }\n}\nallprojects {\n    repositories {\n        mavenCentral()\n    }\n}\n```\n\n2.  Also, add the following under the `dependencies` section:\n\n```\nimplementation 'com.rudderstack.android.integration:kochava:1.0.0'\nimplementation 'com.google.code.gson:gson:2.8.6'\n```\n\n3.  Initialize the RudderStack SDK in the `Application` class’ `onCreate()` method as shown:\n\n```\n// initialize Rudder SDK\nval rudderClient =\n    RudderClient.getInstance(\n        this,\n        WRITE_KEY,\n        RudderConfig.Builder()\n            .withDataPlaneUrl(DATA_PLANE_URL)\n            .withFactory(kochavaIntegration.FACTORY)\n            .build()\n    )\n```\n\nTo add Kochava to your iOS project:\n\n1.  Go your `Podfile` and add the `Rudder-Kochava` extension as shown below:\n\n2.  After adding the dependency followed by `pod install` , you can add the imports to your `AppDelegate.m` file as shown:\n\n```\n#import \"RudderKochavaFactory.h\"\n```\n\n3.  Finally, change the initialization of your `RudderClient` as shown:\n\n```\nRudderConfigBuilder *builder = [[RudderConfigBuilder alloc] init];\n[builder withDataPlaneUrl:DATA_PLANE_URL];\n[builder withFactory:[RudderKochavaFactory instance]];\n[RudderClient getInstance:WRITE_KEY config:[builder build]];\n```\n\nFollow the below steps to add Kochava to your Flutter Project:\n\n1.  Add the following dependency to the `dependencies` section of your `pubspec.yaml` file:\n\n```\nrudder_integration_kochava_flutter: ^1.0.1\n```\n\n2.  Run the below command to install the dependency added in the above step:\n\n3.  Import `RudderIntegrationKochavaFlutter` in your application where you are initializing the SDK:\n\n```\nimport 'package:rudder_integration_kochava_flutter/rudder_integration_kochava_flutter.dart';\n```\n\n4.  Finally, change the initialization of your `RudderClient` as shown:\n\n```\nfinal RudderController rudderClient = RudderController.instance;\nRudderConfigBuilder builder = RudderConfigBuilder();\nbuilder.withFactory(RudderIntegrationKochavaFlutter())\nrudderClient.initialize(<write_key>, config: builder.build(), options: null);\n```\n\n## Track\n\nThe [`track`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/track/) method lets you capture user events along with the properties associated with them.\n\nRudderStack transforms the following events to Kochava’s standard events:\n\n| RudderStack event | Kochava standard event |\n| --- | --- |\n| `Product Added` | `Add to Cart` |\n| `Product Added to Wishlist` | `Add to Wishlist` |\n| `Checkout Started` | `Checkout Start` |\n| `Order Completed` | `Purchase` |\n| `Product Reviewed` | `Rating` |\n| `Products Searched` | `Search` |\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Note that:\n> \n> *   RudderStack sends the rest of the events to Kochava as custom events.\n> *   You can send an event with the name same as that of a Kochava standard event. Kochava accepts it as a standard event.\n\nA sample `track` event sent to Kochava:\n\n```\n[[RudderClient sharedInstance] track:@\"Product Added\" properties:@{\n@\"price\": @2.0,\n@\"product_id\": @\"product_id_a\",\n@\"product_name\": @\"Product Name A\"\n}];\n```\n\nRudderStack changes the `Product Added` event to `Add to Cart` before passing it to Kochava along with the associated properties.\n\n## Screen\n\nThe [`screen`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/screen/) call lets you record whenever your user views their mobile screen, with any additional relevant information about the screen.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack sends the `screen` event to Kochava as a custom event.\n\nA sample `screen` call is shown below:\n\n```\nMainApplication.rudderClient.screen(\n    \"Sample Screen Name\",\n    RudderProperty().putValue(\"prop_key\", \"prop_value\")\n)\n```\n\nIn the above snippet, RudderStack captures all information related to the viewed screen, along with any additional info associated with that event. In Kochava, the above `screen` call is shown as **“screen view `Sample Screen Name` “** along with the properties.\n\n## Configuring push notifications\n\nFollow these steps to configure push notifications for Kochava for the platform of your choice:\n\n1.  Register push notifications for your Android device in the Kochava dashboard.\n2.  Add the following dependency in your project level `build.gradle` file inside the `buildscript`:\n\n```\ndependencies {\n        classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:4.3.5'\n }\n```\n\n3.  Next, add the following dependencies and plugin to your app level `build.gradle` file:\n\n```\ndependencies {\n// for push notifications\n    implementation 'com.google.firebase:firebase-messaging:21.1.0'\n}\napply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'\n```\n\n4.  Place the `google-services.json` downloaded from the `Firebase console` into the root folder of your `app`.\n5.  Passing the new Push Token received from FCM to the Kochava SDK. For more information, look into the **sample-kotlin** app.\n\n```\n// Extending FirebaseMessagingService class\nclass MyFirebaseMessagingService : FirebaseMessagingService() {\n    // The onNewToken callback fires whenever a new token is generated.\n    override fun onNewToken(token: String) {\n        super.onNewToken(token)\n        // Method to pass the push token to the Kochava native sdk\n        registeredForPushNotificationsWithFCMToken(token)\n    }\n}\n```\n\n1.  Add push notifications as a capability by navigating to **Target** > **Signing & Capabilities** of your app when opened in Xcode.\n2.  Enable **Background Modes/Remote notifications** by navigating to **Targets** > **Your App** > **Capabilities** > **Background Modes** and then check **Remote notifications**.\n3.  Register the push notifications for the iOS devices in your Kochava dashboard.\n4.  Add the following code in your app just after initializing RudderStack’s iOS SDK to register the push notifications.\n\n```\n#import <usernotifications>\n// register for push notifications\n    UNUserNotificationCenter* center = [UNUserNotificationCenter currentNotificationCenter];\n    center.delegate = self;\n    [center requestAuthorizationWithOptions:(UNAuthorizationOptionAlert | UNAuthorizationOptionSound | UNAuthorizationOptionBadge)\n                          completionHandler:^(BOOL granted, NSError * _Nullable error) {\n        if (granted) {\n            dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^(void) {\n                [[UIApplication sharedApplication] registerForRemoteNotifications];\n            });\n        }\n    }];\n```\n\n5.  Add the below handlers to handle the tokens and push notifications accordingly:\n\n```\n#import <rudderkochavaintegration.h>\n\n- (void)application:(UIApplication *)application didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:(NSData *)deviceToken\n{\n    [[RudderKochavaIntegration alloc] registeredForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:deviceToken];\n}\n\n- (void)userNotificationCenter:(UNUserNotificationCenter *)center willPresentNotification:(UNNotification *)notification withCompletionHandler:(void (^)(UNNotificationPresentationOptions))completionHandler\n{\n    completionHandler(UNAuthorizationOptionSound | UNAuthorizationOptionAlert | UNAuthorizationOptionBadge);\n}\n\n- (void)userNotificationCenter:(UNUserNotificationCenter *)center didReceiveNotificationResponse:(UNNotificationResponse *)response withCompletionHandler:(void (^)(void))completionHandler\n{\n    [[RudderKochavaIntegration alloc] receivedRemoteNotification:response.notification.request.content.userInfo withActionString:response.actionIdentifier];\n}\n```\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### Where do I get the Kochava App GUID?\n\nTo get your Kochava app GUID, follow these steps:\n\n1.  [Log in to Kochava](https://go.kochava.com/session). Then, go to your account and select the application for the specific campaign.\n2.  Under **Apps & Assets**, select **All Apps**\n3.  Click the desired app for which you want the procure the App GUID.\n4.  You will be able to see the App GUID under the title of your application, within the details.\n\nFor more information, see the [Kochava support guide](https://support.kochava.com/reference-information/locating-an-app-guid/).\n\nQuestions?

instrumented Koddi as a destination in RudderStack, follow this guide to correctly send your events to Koddi in [cloud mode](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#cloud-mode).\n\nFind the open source transformer code for this destination in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-transformer/tree/main/src/cdk/v2/destinations/koddi).\n\n## Track\n\nYou can use the [`track`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/track/) call to track the impressions, clicks, and conversions on any ad by any user in Koddi.\n\n### Ad impressions\n\nYou can track the impression activity in Koddi using the [Impressions API](https://developers.koddi.com/reference/impressions-1).\n\nA sample track call for the `Impressions` event is as shown:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\n  \"Impressions Event\", {\n    tracking_data: \"your-tracking-data\",\n    rank: 1,\n    beacon_issued: \"2024-03-04T15:32:56.409Z\"\n  }, {\n    integrations: {\n      All: true,\n      koddi: {\n        eventType: \"Impressions\" // case-insensitive\n      },\n    }\n  }\n);\n```\n\n#### Supported mappings\n\nRudderStack maps the following `track` fields to the corresponding Koddi properties for `Impressions` event type:\n\n| RudderStack event/property | Koddi property | Data type |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `properties.tracking_data`  <br>Required | `trackingData` | String |\n| `properties.rank`  <br>Required | `rank` | Integer |\n| `properties.beacon_issued`  <br>Required | `beaconIssued` | Date-Time |\n| `timestamp`  <br>`originalTimestamp` | `ts` | Date-Time |\n\n### Ad clicks\n\nYou can track the click activity in Koddi using the [Click API](https://developers.koddi.com/reference/clicks-1).\n\nA sample track call for the `Click` event is as shown:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\n  \"Clicks Event\", {\n    tracking_data: \"your-tracking-data\",\n    rank: 1,\n    beacon_issued: \"2024-03-04T15:32:56.409Z\",\n    test_version_override:

<br>`properties.transaction_id`  <br>Required | `transaction_id` | String | \\-  |\n| `properties.bidders`  <br>Required | `bidders` | \\[\\]Object | See the below note for more information. |\n| `context.ip`  <br>`request_ip` | `user_ip` | String | \\-  |\n| `context.userAgent` | `user_agent` | String | \\-  |\n| `context.page.referring_domain` | `domain` | String | \\-  |\n| `context.device.type` | `device_type` | String | \\-  |\n| `properties.conversion_source` | `conversion_source` | String | \\-  |\n| `timestamp`  <br>`originalTimestamp` | `unixtime` | Double | Rudderstack’s timestamp is in ISO 8601 date format which gets converted to `unixtime` during transformation. |\n\nNote that the `properties.bidders` must contain an object’s array where all the objects must contain `bidder`/`alternate_bidder`, `count`, and `base_price` as the required fields. For example:\n\n```\n\"bidders\": [\n   {\n      \"bidder\": \"bidder1\",  //required\n      \"alternate_bidder\": \"alternate1\", // required if bidder is not present\n      \"count\": 1, // required\n      \"base_price\": 100, // required\n      \"total_price\": 227\n      \"check_in\": \"2024-03-04T15:32:56.409Z\"\n      \"check_out\": \"2024-03-04T15:32:56.409Z\"\n   }\n]\n```\n\nQuestions?

    "markdown": "# Connect a Reverse ETL source to HubSpot\n\nConfigure a Reverse ETL source with your HubSpot destination.\n\n* * *\n\n*     4 minute read  \n    \n\nThis guide takes you through the required scopes, predefined identifiers, and creating the association between the object records while connecting a Reverse ETL source to HubSpot destination.\n\n## Required scopes\n\nIf you’re connecting a [Reverse ETL](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/reverse-etl/) source to HubSpot that uses a [private app access token](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/api/intro-to-auth#private-app-access-tokens) for authentication, make sure your access token has the following scopes:\n\n```\ncrm.lists.read\ncrm.objects.contacts.read\ncrm.objects.contacts.write\ncrm.schemas.custom.read\ncrm.objects.custom.read\ncrm.objects.custom.write\ncrm.schemas.custom.write\ncrm.objects.companies.write\ncrm.schemas.contacts.read\ncrm.lists.write\ncrm.objects.companies.read\ncrm.objects.deals.read\ncrm.objects.deals.write\ncrm.schemas.companies.read\ncrm.schemas.companies.write\ncrm.schemas.contacts.write\ncrm.schemas.deals.read\ncrm.schemas.deals.write\ncrm.objects.owners.read\ncrm.objects.quotes.write\ncrm.objects.quotes.read\ncrm.schemas.quotes.read\ncrm.objects.line_items.read\ncrm.objects.line_items.write\ncrm.schemas.line_items.read\n```\n\n## Predefined identifiers\n\nWhile connecting a [Reverse ETL](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/reverse-etl/) source with HubSpot using the [Visual Data Mapper](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/reverse-etl/visual-data-mapper/) feature, you need to select a HubSpot **Object** where you want to sync the data. Further, you can choose a warehouse column and HubSpot field to map your records in the [Choose identifier](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/reverse-etl/visual-data-mapper/#choosing-the-identifier) section:\n\n[![HubSpot connection settings](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/predefined_object_hubspot.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/predefined_object_hubspot.webp)\n\nIf you select a standard HubSpot **Object**, the **Destination fields** dropdown displays the predefined unique identifiers along with any other unique field of the object. These predefined unique identifiers are mentioned in the below table corresponding to the standard HubSpot objects:\n\n| Standard HubSpot object | Predefined unique identifiers |\n| --- | --- |\n| Company | Company Domain Name |\n| Contact | Email |\n| Deal | Deal Name |\n| Line Item | Name |\n| Quote | Quote number |\n\nIf you select a custom HubSpot **Object**, only the unique fields of the object are displayed in the **Destination fields** dropdown.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> The values of unique identifiers are case-sensitive and should be sent exactly as they are present in Hubspot.\n\n## Creating association between object records\n\nYou can create an association between the HubSpot object records while connecting your HubSpot destination to a [Reverse ETL](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/reverse-etl/) source using the [Visual Data Mapper](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/reverse-etl/visual-data-mapper/) feature.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nThe following pre-requisites must be met to create an association between the HubSpot object records:\n\n*   You must create two separate connections in the RudderStack dashboard using any Reverse ETL source and HubSpot destination as shown:\n    \n    [![HubSpot connection settings](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/hubspot-connections.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/hubspot-connections.webp)\n    \n    *   The first connection will push data into the HubSpot object. For example, pushing data into a company object.\n    *   The second connection will create an association between the object records. For example, associating the company and contact objects. You must configure the HubSpot destination in the second connection using the [new API](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/hubspot/setting-up-hubspot-in-rudderstack/#new-api) and enable the **Create associations between object record** setting in the RudderStack dashboard. The detailed steps to create this connection are explained in the below section.\n\n### Steps to create association\n\nFollow the below steps to create an association between the HubSpot object records:\n\n1.  Add a Reverse ETL source and add the HubSpot destination to it. For detailed steps on adding a source and destination, you can refer to the [Reverse ETL Quickstart](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/data-pipelines/reverse-etl/quickstart/) guide.\n2.  While configuring the [HubSpot connection settings](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/hubspot/setting-up-hubspot-in-rudderstack/#new-api) in the RudderStack dashboard, enable the **Create associations between object record** setting and click **Continue**.\n3.  Select the required **Schema** and **Table** whose data you want to sync to HubSpot.\n4.  Select the HubSpot **Object** for which you want to create the association.\n5.  In the next dropdown, select the HubSpot object with which you want to associate the above-mentioned object.\n6.  Based on the object selections, the relevant associations (from HubSpot account) are populated in the **Association** dropdown. You can select the required one:\n\n[![HubSpot connection settings](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/sync-associations-hubspot.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/sync-associations-hubspot.webp)\n\n7.  In the **Choose identifier** section, choose a warehouse column and destination field to map your records from the source to the destination. You can choose any destination field from the dropdown which will act as a unique identifier.\n\n[![HubSpot connection settings](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/unique-identifier-hubspot-1.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/unique-identifier-hubspot-1.webp)\n\n8.  Choose a warehouse column each for **From Record ID** and **To Record ID** fields which will act as Hubspot’s unique ID to identify an object.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> **From Record ID** and **To Record ID** are the column names of the two objects you want to associate. For example, if you want to associate a company and a contact, the **From Record ID** should be a `Company Id` and **To Record ID** should be a `Contact Id`.\n\n[![HubSpot connection settings](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/unique-identifier-hubspot.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/unique-identifier-hubspot.webp)\n\nSimilarly, you can create more of such associations between the object records.\n\nQuestions?

    "markdown": "# HubSpot device mode (legacy API)\n\nSend events to HubSpot via device mode using the legacy API.\n\n* * *\n\n*     3 minute read  \n    \n\nRudderStack supports the following API calls while sending data to Hubspot via web [device mode](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#device-mode) using the [legacy API](https://legacydocs.hubspot.com/docs/overview?_ga=2.34803302.670362313.1663315856-97001172.1658910392).\n\n## Identify\n\nRudderStack sends the [`identify`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/identify/) call to create or update a contact in HubSpot. The contact’s email ID **must be present** in the `traits` object of the `identify` call.\n\nYou must call either `page` or `track` after the `identify` call to create a contact. RudderStack automatically associates the previously made `page` and `track` calls with that contact once they are identified.\n\nA sample `identify` call is as shown:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify({\n  firstName: \"Alex\",\n  city: \"New Orleans\",\n  country: \"USA\",\n  phone: \"+1-202-555-0146\",\n  email: \"alex@example.com\",\n  custom_flavor: \"chocolate\",\n  custom_date: 1574769933368,\n  custom_date1: new Date(\"2019-10-14T11:15:53.296Z\"),\n})\n```\n\n### Special fields\n\nHubSpot supports the following traits as special fields:\n\n*   `address`\n*   `city`\n*   `companyName`\n*   `email`\n*   `firstName`\n*   `lastName`\n*   `position`\n*   `phone`\n*   `zip`\n\n### Custom properties\n\nRudderStack supports sending custom properties to HubSpot via the `identify` call. These properties will update the `contact` property you have **already created** in HubSpot:\n\n[![HubSpot create property](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/hubspot-create-property.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/hubspot-create-property.webp)\n\nWhen you provide any custom property in the event, RudderStack automatically converts the field name into the lower case and replaces any space with an underscore. This is because HubSpot does not accept properties in the upper case and spaces.\n\nRudderStack then maps the field values present in the `traits` to the corresponding HubSpot custom property.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> HubSpot discards any property that does not exist and returns a **400 Bad Request** error.\n\n### Dates\n\nFor sending properties of `date` type, you can send them as the [epoch time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) or as a `date` object. RudderStack converts them to the required HubSpot format (midnight UTC).\n\n## Track\n\nA [`track`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/track/) call lets you record various user actions and any properties associated with them.\n\nTo associate a `track` call with a user, you need to specify the user’s `email` under `context.traits` . Additionally, RudderStack associates the `track` events with the same user after an `identify` request is successfully made.\n\nA sample `track` event is as shown:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\n  \"Order Completed\", {\n    value: 30,\n  }, {\n    context: {\n      traits: {\n        firstname: \"Alex\",\n        city: \"New Orleans\",\n        country: \"USA\",\n        phone: \"+1-202-555-0146\",\n        email: \"alex@example.com\",\n      },\n    },\n  }\n)\n```\n\n### Revenue events\n\nFor the revenue events, a `value` or `revenue` key should be included in the event properties to be recorded in HubSpot.\n\n## Page\n\nYou can make a [`page`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/page/) call to automatically record page views.\n\nA sample `page` event is as shown:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.page({\n  path: \"path\",\n});\n```\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### Can I use HubSpot website analytics?\n\nYes, you can. RudderStack supports sending `page` calls in device mode which can be used for HubSpot website analytics.\n\nQuestions?

    "markdown": "# InMoment (formerly Wootric) | RudderStack Docs\n\nSend your event data from RudderStack to InMoment.\n\n* * *\n\n*     5 minute read  \n    \n\n[InMoment (formerly Wootric)](https://inmoment.com/wootric/) is a cloud-based customer feedback management platform that helps product, customer success, and marketing leaders to improve the customer experience.\n\nRudderStack supports InMoment as a destination where you can seamlessly send your event data.\n\n## Getting started\n\nBefore configuring InMoment as a destination in RudderStack, verify if the source platform is supported by InMoment by referring to the table below:\n\n| Connection Mode | Web | Mobile | Server |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Device mode | \\-  | \\-  | \\-  |\n| Cloud mode | Supported | Supported | Supported |\n\nOnce you have confirmed that the source platform supports sending events to InMoment, follow these steps:\n\n1.  From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add a source. Then, from the list of destinations, select **Wootric**.\n2.  Assign a name to the destination and click **Continue**.\n\n## Connection settings\n\nTo successfully configure InMoment as a destination, you will need to configure the following settings:\n\n[![InMoment connection settings](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/inmoment-connection-settings.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/inmoment-connection-settings.webp)\n\n*   **Username**: Enter the email you use to log in to your [InMoment](https://app.wootric.com/) account.\n*   **Password**: Enter the password you use to log in to InMoment.\n*   **Account Token**: Enter the unique account token from the InMoment dashboard by navigating to **Settings** > **Your Account**.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Refer to the [FAQ](#faq) section below for more information on getting the InMoment account token.\n\n## Identify\n\nYou can use the [`identify`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/identify/) call to create or update a user in InMoment.\n\nRudderStack follows the below approach to look up a user and update their details:\n\n1.  If your event contains `context.externalId.0.id` (the Wootric user ID), RudderStack updates the user details against this ID. A sample snippet containing `context.externalId.0.id` is as shown:\n\n```\n{\n  \"context\": {\n    \"externalId\": [{\n      \"type\": \"wootricEndUserId\",\n      \"id\": \"12345\"\n    }]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n2.  If `context.externalId.0.id` is absent, RudderStack then looks for the `external_id` (RudderStack’s `userId`) field. If it exists, RudderStack updates the user against this ID.\n\n3.  If none of `context.externalId.0.id` or `external_id` are present, RudderStack creates a new user in Wootric.\n\nA sample `identify` call is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify(\"1hKOmRA4GRlm\", {\n    email: \"alex@example.com\",\n    phone: \"+12025550146\",\n    name: \"Alex Keener\",\n    city: \"New Orleans\",\n    gender: \"male\",\n    createdAt: \"2021-01-20T13:39:21.032Z\",\n    timestamp: \"2021-01-20T13:39:21.032Z\"\n});\n```\n\n### Property mappings\n\nThe following tables list the mappings between RudderStack and InMoment events/properties based on the operation being performed:\n\n*   [Retrieve a user by external ID](https://docs.wootric.com/api/#get-a-specific-end-user-by-external-id)\n    \n    |

survey response by the end user\n*   Create a survey decline by the end user\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack also updates the user properties if they are present in the event.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> You can use the `track` events only for the existing Wootric users.\n\nRudderStack checks the `message.integrations.Wootric.eventType` field to determine whether to create a response or a decline.\n\nA sample `track` call is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\n    \"Submit\", {\n

    "markdown": "# Kustomer | RudderStack Docs\n\nSend your event data from RudderStack to Kustomer.\n\n* * *\n\n*     8 minute read  \n    \n\n[Kustomer](https://www.kustomer.com/) is a modern customer engagement platform designed for enterprises. It gives you a holistic view of your users and customer base, lets you provide best-in-class support, and engage with your customers through meaningful interactions.\n\nYou can now send your event data directly to Kustomer via RudderStack.\n\n## Getting started\n\nBefore configuring your source and destination in RudderStack, verify if the platform you are sending the events from is supported by Kustomer by referring to the following table:\n\n| **Connection Mode** | **Web** | **Mobile** | **Server** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Device mode** | \\-  | \\-  | \\-  |\n| **Cloud mode** | **Supported** | **Supported** | **Supported** |\n\nOnce you have confirmed that the platform supports sending events to Kustomer, perform the steps below:\n\n*   From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add the source and **Kustomer** as a destination.\n\n[![](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/kustomer-v3-config.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/kustomer-v3-config.webp)\n\nConfiguration Settings for Kustomer\n\n## Configuration Settings\n\nTo successfully configure Kustomer as a destination, you will need to configure the following settings:\n\n*   **API Key:** Your API Key is a unique key generated for your Kustomer account. You can find it under **Settings** by navigating to **Security** - **API Keys**.\n*   **Enable advanced Kustomer transformations:** RudderStack handles the payload nuances for Kustomer if this option is enabled. Check the **Advanced Kustomer Transformations** section below for more information on this setting.\n*   **Add email as Tracking identity:** If this setting is enabled, RudderStack adds the email as an identifier when making `track`/`page`/`screen` calls to Kustomer.\n*   **Disable email as a Tracking property:** If this option is enabled, RudderStack will not add the email as a tracking property for the `track`/`page`/`screen` calls made to Kustomer.\n*   **Enable generic title for Page events:** Enable this option to track all `page` events with a generic name `Web-Page-Viewed`.\n*   **Enable generic title for Screen events:** Enable this option to track all `screen` events with a generic name `Screen-Viewed`.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> The relevant `roles` (`org.permission.customer.create`, `org.permission.customer.read`, `org.permission.customer.update`, `org.tracking`) are required for an **API Key** to successfully access the Kustomer endpoints. Check the [Kustomer docs](https://support.kustomer.com/api-keys-SJs5YTIWX) for more information on how to do this.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> All server-side destination requests require either a `anonymousId` or a `userId` in the payload.\n\n## Kustomer Payload Restrictions\n\nFor `page`, `screen`, and `track` events being sent to Kustomer, there are restrictions on some of the components of the event payload.\n\n### Event Name\n\nThe `event name` sent in the `page`, `screen`, and `track` events cannot include any spaces.\n\n| **Event Name Example** | **Result** |\n| --- | --- |\n| `Cart Viewed` | Error |\n| `Cart-Viewed` | Successful |\n| `Cart_Viewed` | Successful |\n\n### Meta Object\n\nFor `page`, `screen`, and `track` events, all of the data in the `properties` parameter will be sent to the Kustomer API through the `meta` object. However, there are certain restrictions in place on the key-value pairs within the `meta` object.\n\n#### String Values\n\nFor the key-value pairs where the value is of the `string` type, the key must not end with the characters `Num` or `At`.\n\n| String Key Name Example | Result |\n| --- | --- |\n| `{ product_nameNum: 'UNO' }` | Error |\n| `{ product_nameAt: 'UNO' }` | Not Semantically Correct |\n| `{ product_name: 'UNO' }` | Successful |\n\n#### Date-time String Values\n\nFor key-value pairs where the value has a type of `date-time string`, the key must end with the characters `At`.\n\n| Date-time String Key Name Example | Result |\n| --- | --- |\n| `{ purchased: '2020-02-02T00:23:09.544Z' }` | Not Semantically Correct |\n| `{ purchasedAt: '2020-02-02T00:23:09.544Z' }` | Successful |\n\n#### Number Values\n\nFor key-value pairs where the value has a type of `number`, the key must end with the characters `Num`.\n\n| Number Key Name Example | Result |\n| --- | --- |\n| `{ revenue: 300 }` | Error |\n| `{ revenueNum: 30 }` | Successful |\n\n#### Object or Array Values\n\nThe values for all keys in the `meta` object must be **flat**, meaning they cannot be nested objects or arrays.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> If you are using an advanced transformation, RudderStack will handle the nested objects, arrays, and Boolean and parse them to strings for compatibility with Kustomer.\n\n| Value Example | Result |\n| --- | --- |\n| `{ items: { price: 32, name: 'dinner plate' } }` | Error |\n| `{ items: [ 'dinner plate', 'fork', 'spoon' ] }` | Error |\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> For `track`, `page` and `screen` events, Kustomer supports only `number, string,`and `string` with `date-time (ISO)` format for custom event properties. Please refer to the [official Kustomer Documentation](https://apidocs.kustomer.com/#fe1b29a6-7f3c-40a7-8f54-973ecd0335e8) for more information on this.\n\n## Advanced Kustomer Transformations\n\nWhen the **Advanced Kustomer Transformation** option is enabled, RudderStack will update the payload as per Kustomer’s requirements.\n\nThe following behaviour is expected:\n\n| Event Name | With Advanced Transformation Enabled | Transformed? |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `Order Completed` | `Order-Completed` | Yes |\n| `OrderCompleted` | `OrderCompleted` | No  |\n| `Order-Completed` | `Order-Completed` | No  |\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> The event names with whitespaces will be replaced with `-`.\n\n| Event Property | Value | With Advanced Transformation Enabled | Transformed? |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `income` | `500` | `incomeNum` | Yes |\n| `income Num` | `500` | `income-Num` | Yes |\n| `income-Num` | `500` | `income-Num` | No  |\n| `income_Num` | `500` | `income_Num` | No  |\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> The event properties with numeric values will be appended with `Num` if not already present, while the whitespaces will be replaced with `-`.\n\n| Event Property | Value | With Advanced Transformation Enabled | Transformed? |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `created` | `'2020-02-02T00:23:09.544Z'` | `createdAt` | Yes |\n| `created At` | `'2020-02-02T00:23:09.544Z'` | `created-At` | Yes |\n| `created-At` | `'2020-02-02T00:23:09.544Z'` | `created-At` | No  |\n| `created_At` | `'2020-02-02T00:23:09.544Z'` | `created_At` | No  |\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> The event properties with the date-time string values will be appended with `At` if not already present, while the whitespaces will be replaced with a `-`.\n\n| Event Name | Value | With Advanced Transformation Enabled | Transformed? |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `Cart Name` | `Test Cart` | `Cart-Name` | Yes |\n| `CartName` | `Test Cart` | `CartName` | No  |\n| `Cart-Name` | `Test Cart` | `Cart-Name` | No  |\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> For the event properties with `string` values, the whitespaces will be replaced with `-`.\n\n## Page\n\nThe `page` call allows you to record information whenever a user sees a web page, along with its associated properties.\n\nWhen you send a `page` event , RudderStack sends that event to Kustomer as a **“Web Page Viewed `Page Name`** event.\n\nAn example of a `page` call is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.page(\"Cart\", \"Cart-Viewed\", {\n  path: \"/cart\",\n  referrer: \"test.com\",\n  search: \"term\",\n  title: \"test_item\",\n  url: \"http://test.in\",\n  kustomerSessionId: \"kSession\",\n  kustomerTrackingId: \"ktracking\",\n})\n```\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> The `event name` must not include any spaces or the event will fail.\n\nIf the `kustomerSessionId` or `kustomerTrackingId` is included in `properties`, RudderStack will map it as `sessionId` and `trackingId` for that `page` event as per the [Kustomer Tracking Event Reference](https://apidocs.kustomer.com/#fe1b29a6-7f3c-40a7-8f54-973ecd0335e8).\n\n## Screen\n\nThe `screen` method allows you to record whenever a user sees the mobile screen, along with any associated optional properties. This call is similar to the `page` call, but is exclusive to your mobile device.\n\nWhen you send a `page` event , RudderStack sends that event to Kustomer as a **“Screen Viewed `Screen Name`** event.\n\nA sample `screen` call looks like the following code snippet:\n\n```\n[[RSClient sharedInstance] screen:@\"Sample-Screen-Name\" properties:@{@\"prop_key\" : @\"prop_value\"}];\n```\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> The `event name` must not include any spaces or the event will fail.\n\nIf the `kustomerSessionId` or `kustomerTrackingId` is included in `properties`, RudderStack will map it as `sessionId` and `trackingId` for the `page` event as per the [Kustomer Tracking Event Reference](https://apidocs.kustomer.com/#fe1b29a6-7f3c-40a7-8f54-973ecd0335e8).\n\n## Track\n\nThe `track` call allows you to capture any action that the user might perform, along with the properties associated with that action. Each action is considered to be an event. It is similar to `screen` event, and the user is by default associated with `userId` or `anonymousId`.\n\nA sample `track` call looks like the following:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"Checked-Out\", {\n  Clicked_Rush_delivery_Button: true,\n  total_value: 2000,\n  revenue: 2000,\n})\n```\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> The `event name` must not include any spaces or the event will fail.\n\nIn the above snippet, RudderStack captures the information related to the `Checked Out` event along with any additional information about that event; in this case, the details of the `Checked out` event.\n\nIf the `kustomerSessionId` or `kustomerTrackingId` is included in `properties`, RudderStack will map it as `sessionId` and `trackingId` for the `page` event as per the [Kustomer Tracking Event Reference](https://apidocs.kustomer.com/#fe1b29a6-7f3c-40a7-8f54-973ecd0335e8).\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> For `track`, `page` and `screen` events, Kustomer supports only `number, string,`and `string` with `date-time` format for custom event properties. Refer to the [official Kustomer Documentation](https://apidocs.kustomer.com/#fe1b29a6-7f3c-40a7-8f54-973ecd0335e8) for more information on this.\n\n## Identify\n\nThe `identify` call lets you associate a user with their actions and capture all relevant traits about them. This information includes unique `userid` as well as any optional information such as `name`, `email`, etc.\n\nA number of RudderStack’s special traits map to Kustomer’s standard user profile fields, as shown in the table below.\n\n| **Kustomer** | **RudderStack** | **Supported Type** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `name` | `name` or `firstName` and `lastName` | `string` |\n| `externalId` | `userId` or `anonymousId` | `string` |\n| `username` | `userName` | `string` |\n| `company` | `company` | `string` |\n| `signedUpAt` | `createdAt` | `string date-time` |\n| `lastActivityAt` | `lastActivityAt` | `string date-time` |\n| `lastCustomerActivityAt` | `lastCustomerActivityAt` | `string date-time` |\n| `lastSeenAt` | `lastSeenAt` | `string date-time` |\n| `avatarUrl` | `avatar` | `string` |\n| `gender` | `gender` | `string` |\n| `tags` | `tags` | `array` |\n| `emails` | `emails` or `email` | `array` or `string` |\n| `phones` | `phones` or `phone` | `array` or `string` |\n| `socials` | `socials` | `array` |\n| `birthdayAt` | `birthday` or `dob` | `string date-time` |\n| `urls` | `website` | `string` |\n| `locations` | `address` | `string` or `object` |\n| `locale` | `context.locale` | `string` |\n| `importedAt` | `importedAt` | `string date-time` |\n| `custom` | `customObject` | `object` |\n| `sentiment` | `sentiment` | `object` |\n| `whatsapps` | `whatsapps` | array of `object` |\n| `facebookIds` | `facebookIds` | array of `object` |\n| `instagramIds` | `instagramIds` | array of `object` |\n| `timeZone` | `timeZone` | `string` |\n| `defaultLang` | `defaultLanguage` | `string` |\n| `rev` | `rev` | `number` |\n\nFor more information on the supported traits, check out the [official Kustomer Documentation](https://apidocs.kustomer.com/#07bd1072-4d4b-4875-b526-8369d711e811)\n\nA sample `identify` call looks like the following:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify(\"userId\", {\n  email: \"user@website.com\",\n  phone: \"phone\",\n  birthday: \"birthday\",\n  name: \"full name\",\n  address: {\n    street: \"street\",\n    city: \"city\",\n    state: \"state\",\n    postalCode: \"zip\",\n  },\n  userName: \"userName\",\n  company: \"company\",\n  signedUpAt: \"date-time\",\n  lastActivityAt: \"date-time\",\n  lastCustomerActivityAt: \"date-time\",\n  lastSeenAt: \"date-time\",\n  avatar: \"avatar-url\",\n  gender: \"male\",\n  tags: [\"tag1\", \"tag2\"],\n  locale: \"en_US\",\n  website: \"www.website.com\",\n  socials: [\n    {\n      verified: true,\n      userid: \"100\",\n      type: \"twitter\",\n      username: \"@twiiterHandle\",\n      url: \"http://twitter.com/twitterhandle\",\n    },\n    {\n      verified: false,\n      userid: \"200\",\n      type: \"facebook\",\n      username: \"facebookhandle\",\n      url: \"http://facebook.com/facebookhandle\",\n    },\n  ],\n})\n```\n\nAn `identify` call with multiple `emails`, and `phones` along with an `address` with string `value` looks like the following:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify(\"userId\", {\n  emails: [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"home\",\n        \"email\": \"home@email.com\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"type\": \"work\",\n        \"email\": \"work@email.com\"\n      }\n    ],\n  phones: [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"home\",\n        \"phone\": \"+188890987\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"type\": \"work\",\n        \"phone\": \"+1676330984\"\n      }\n    ],\n  birthday: \"21-02-1988\",\n  name: \"Name Surname\",\n  address: \"street city state zip\"\n  userName: \"userName\",\n  company: \"company\"\n  locale: \"en_US\",\n  website: \"www.website.com\"\n});\n```\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> If a customer already exists, the new values will be updated for that user. RudderStack automatically maps the `userId` (or `anoymousId`) to the customer’s `externalId` in Kustomer.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> If you choose to send Customer’s `id` in `context.externalId` \\[{type:kustomerId, id:uniqueId}\\]) RudderStack will skip looking-up the customer using `email`/`userId`/`anonymousId`and directly update the user information for that`id` with the new attributes.\n\nQuestions?

    "markdown": "# Leanplum | RudderStack Docs\n\nSend your event data from RudderStack to Leanplum.\n\n* * *\n\n*     5 minute read  \n    \n\n[Leanplum](https://www.leanplum.com/) is a popular marketing and customer engagement platform. It boosts customer engagement and retention, leading to better conversion and increased business revenue.\n\nFind the open source transformer code for this destination in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-transformer/tree/master/src/v0/destinations/leanplum).\n\n## Setup\n\n1.  In your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), go to **Directory** > **Destinations** > **Cloud Destinations** and search for **Leanplum**.\n2.  Connect your source and click **Continue**.\n\n### Connection settings\n\nConfigure the following settings to set up Leanplum as a destination in RudderStack:\n\n*   **Name**: Assign a name to uniquely identify the destination.\n*   **Application ID**: Enter your Leanplum application ID.\n*   **Client Key**: Enter the associated client key.\n\n### Connection mode\n\nSpecify how you want to route events from your source to Leanplum.\n\nRudderStack supports sending events to Leanplum via the following [connection modes](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/):\n\n| Connection mode | Web | Mobile | Server |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Device mode | \\-  | **Supported** | \\-  |\n| Cloud mode | **Supported** | **Supported** | **Supported** |\n| Hybrid mode | \\-  | **Supported** | \\-  |\n\n### Send events in hybrid mode\n\nYou can use [hybrid mode](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#hybrid-mode) to send all events to Leanplum from your [iOS](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-ios-sdk/) and [Android](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-android-sdk/) sources.\n\nUse the hybrid mode option (highlighted below) while connecting your iOS/Android source to the Leanplum destination. Then, [add the Leanplum integration to your project](#add-leanplum-integration-to-your-project).\n\n[![Leanplum hybrid mode connection setting](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/braze-hybrid-mode.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/braze-hybrid-mode.webp)\n\n#### Why use hybrid mode\n\nCertain Leanplum functionalities like push notifications and A/B testing require you to load the Leanplum SDK.\n\nWhen you choose hybrid mode to send events to Leanplum, RudderStack:\n\n*   Initializes the Leanplum SDK.\n*   Sends all the user-generated events (`identify`, `track`, `page`, `screen`, and `group`) to Leanplum only through [cloud mode](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#cloud-mode) and blocks them from being sent via device mode.\n*   Sends the auto-generated events (A/B testing, push notifications that require the Leanplum SDK) via [device mode](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#device-mode).\n\nWith hybrid mode, you can send the auto-generated and user-generated events to Leanplum using a single connection.\n\n### Configuration settings\n\nAfter completing the initial setup, configure the following settings to correctly receive your data in Leanplum:\n\n*   **Use in Development Environment**: If this setting is enabled, make sure to provide the **Client Key** corresponding to your development environment. Failure to do so will result in a faulty SDK initialization and your events will fail.\n*   **Client-side event filtering**: This setting lets you specify which events should be blocked or allowed to flow through to Leanplum. For more information, see [Client-side Events Filtering](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/event-filtering/).\n*   **OneTrust cookie consent settings**: This setting lets you associate the [OneTrust](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/data-governance/consent-management/onetrust/) cookie consent groups to Leanplum.\n\n## Add Leanplum integration to your project\n\nDepending on your platform of integration, follow these steps below to add Leanplum to your project:\n\n1.  Open your `app/build.gradle` (Module: app) file, and add the following.\n\n```\nrepositories {\n    mavenCentral()\n}\n```\n\n2.  Add the following under `dependencies` section:\n\n```\nimplementation 'com.rudderstack.android.sdk:core:1.+'\nimplementation 'com.rudderstack.android.integration:leanplum:1.+'\nimplementation 'com.leanplum:leanplum-core:5+'\n```\n\n3.  Change the SDK initialization to the following:\n\n```\n// initialize Rudder SDK\nval rudderClient =\n    RudderClient.getInstance(\n        this,\n        WRITE_KEY,\n        RudderConfig.Builder()\n            .withDataPlaneUrl(DATA_PLANE_URL)\n            .withFactory(LeanPlumIntegrationFactory.FACTORY)\n            .build()\n    )\n```\n\n1.  Open the `Podfile` of your project and add the following:\n\n2.  Run the `pod install` command.\n3.  Add the imports to your `AppDelegate.m` file:\n\n```\n#import \"RudderLeanplumFactory.h\"\n```\n\n3.  Change the SDK initialization as shown:\n\n```\nRudderConfigBuilder *builder = [[RudderConfigBuilder alloc] init];\n[builder withEndPointUrl:DATA_PLANE_URL];\n[builder withFactory:[RudderLeanplumFactory instance]];\n[RudderClient getInstance:WRITE_KEY config:[builder build]];\n```\n\n1.  Add the following to the `dependencies` section of your `pubspec.yaml` file.\n\n```\nrudder_integration_leanplum_flutter: ^1.0.1\n```\n\n2.  Install the dependency added in the above step:\n\n3.  Import `RudderIntegrationLeanplumFlutter` in your application where you want to initialize the SDK.\n\n```\nimport 'package:rudder_integration_leanplum_flutter/rudder_integration_leanplum_flutter.dart';\n```\n\n4.  Finally, change the SDK initialization:\n\n```\nfinal RudderController rudderClient = RudderController.instance;\nRudderConfigBuilder builder = RudderConfigBuilder();\nbuilder.withFactory(RudderIntegrationLeanplumFlutter());\nrudderClient.initialize(<write_key>, config: builder.build(), options: null);\n```\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> For iOS, Leanplum needs to be linked either as a dynamic or static framework with your application. You can do so by adding the following lines to your `Podfile`:\n> \n> ```\n> use_frameworks! :linkage=> :static // linking statically\n> \n> # OR\n> \n> use_frameworks! :linkage=> :dynamic // linking dynamically\n> ```\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Note the following:\n> \n> *   The RudderStack SDKs store the user traits from the `identify` call in `SharedPreference` and `NSUserDefaults` for Android and iOS respectively.\n> *   If RudderStack detects `userId` in the persisted traits information, it starts the native SDK along with it. If it is unable to find `userId`, RudderStack initializes the SDK without it. This is helpful in building a better session.\n> *   For a persisted `userId`, the code for Android is `Leanplum.start(applicationContext, userId)`. If `userId` is absent, it is `Leanplum.start(applicationContext)`. RudderStack follows a similar pattern for iOS as well.\n> *   While searching for the user identifier in the persisted traits, RudderStack looks for either `userId` or `id`.\n\n## Identify\n\nRudderStack uses the [`identify`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/identify/) call to populate and send user information to Leanplum.\n\nNote that:\n\n*   RudderStack uses the `setUserId` method of the Leanplum SDK to set the user’s identifier (`userId`).\n*   It passes all the properties present in the event’s `context.traits` to the Leanplum SDK’s `setUserAttributes` method, which populates them in Leanplum.\n\nThe following snippet highlights a sample `identify` call:\n\n```\n[[RudderClient sharedInstance] identify:@\"developer_user_id\"\n                                 traits:@{@\"email\": @\"bar@foo.com\"}];\n```\n\n## Track\n\nRudderStack forwards the [`track`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/track/) events to Leanplum without any modification to the payload, as long as the event name is not `null`.\n\nThe following snippet highlights a sample `track`call:\n\n```\n[[RudderClient sharedInstance] track:@\"Accepted Terms of Service\"\n                          properties:@{\n                                  @\"foo\": @\"bar\",\n                              @\"foo_int\": @134\n}];\n```\n\n## Screen\n\nLeanplum supports tracking the user states. RudderStack uses the [`screen`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/screen/) calls to advance the user’s states to LeanPlum. For every `screen` event, RudderStack calls the `advanceTo` method of the Leanplum SDK along with the screen name and the associated event properties.\n\nRudderStack also sends the automatically tracked `screen` events to LeanPlum.\n\nThe following snippet highlights a sample `screen` call:\n\n```\n[[RudderClient sharedInstance] screen:@\"Main\"];\n```\n\n## Reset\n\nYou can use the `reset` method to clear the user identification in Leanplum. RudderStack calls `clearUserContent` method of the Leanplum SDK to clear the persisted user data.\n\nThe following snippet highlights a sample `reset` call:\n\n```\n[[RudderClient sharedInstance] reset];\n```\n\n## Debugging\n\nRudderStack sets the verbose logging for development mode for the Leanplum Native SDK, based on the `logLevel` set during the SDK initialization.\n\nIf the `logLevel` is set as `DEBUG` or more, RudderStack enables logging using the `enableVerboseLoggingInDevelopmentMode` method of the Leanplum SDK.\n\nQuestions?

It enables you to segment your contacts based on business requirements, personalize your marketing strategy, and create personalized campaigns for better customer engagement.\n\nRudderStack supports Mautic as a destination where you can seamlessly send your event data.\n\n## Getting started\n\nRudderStack supports sending event data to Mautic via the following [connection modes](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/):\n\n| Connection Mode | Web | Mobile | Server |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Device mode | \\-  | \\-  | \\-  |\n| Cloud mode | Supported | Supported | Supported |\n\nOnce you have confirmed that the source platform supports sending events to Mautic, follow these steps:\n\n1.

Assign a name to the destination and click **Continue**.\n\n## Connection settings\n\nTo successfully configure Mautic as a destination, you will need to configure the following settings:\n\n*   **Username**: Enter the username associated with your Mautic account.\n*   **Password**: Enter the password for the above username.\n*   **Domain Method**: Choose the preferred domain method from **Domain** or **Subdomain**. It is recommended to use **Domain** if you have a self-hosted Mautic instance.\n    *   **Domain Name**: Specify the domain name if you have chosen **Domain** above.  \n        OR\n    *   **Subdomain Name**: Specify the subdomain associated with your Mautic instance if you have chosen **SubDomain** above. For example, if the root URL of your Mautic instance is `customdomain.domain.com`, then your subdomain name will be `customdomain`.\n*   **Mautic property name to used as lookup field**: Enter a unique Mautic user property which RudderStack will use for contact lookup.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack will retrieve this property from the user traits in the event.\n\n## Identify\n\nYou can use the [`identify`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/identify/) call to [create](https://developer.mautic.org/?json#create-contact) or update a user in Mautic.\n\nA sample `identify` call is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify(\"1hKOmRA4GRlm\", {\n  state: \"Louisiana\",\n  firstName: \"Alex\",\n  lastName: \"Keener\",\n  title: \"Mr\",\n  zipcode: \"90009\",\n  prospectOrCustomer: \"Customer\",\n  country: \"USA\",\n  website: \"www.alex.com\",\n  subscriptionStatus: \"New\",\n  phone: \"12025550146\",\n});\n```\n\n### Supported mappings\n\nThe following table lists the mappings between the **optional** RudderStack and Mautic properties:\n\n| RudderStack property | Mautic property | Data type |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `context.traits.email` / `traits.email` / `properties.email`/`context.externalId.id` | `email` | String |\n| `traits.title` / `context.traits.title` | `title` | String |\n| `traits.firstName` / `traits.firstname` / `traits.first_name` / `context.traits.firstName` / `context.traits.firstname` / `context.traits.first_name` | `firstname` | Any |\n| `traits.lastName` / `traits.lastname` / `traits.last_name` / `context.traits.lastName` / `context.traits.lastname` / `context.traits.last_name` | `lastname` | Any |\n| `timestamp` / `originalTimestamp` | `last_active` | Timestamp in ISO 8601 format |\n| `phone` | `phone` / `mobile` | Any |\n| `traits.address.city` | `city` | String |\n| `traits.address.addressLine1`/ `context.traits.address.addressLine1` | `address1` | String |\n| `traits.address.addressLine2`/ `context.traits.address.addressLine2` | `address2` | String |\n| `traits.address`/ `context.traits.address` | `address1` + `address2` | String |\n| `traits.company.employeeCount` | `company_size` | Integer |\n| `traits.role` / `context.traits.role` | `role` | String |\n| `traits.website` / `context.traits.website` / `properties.website` | `website` | String |\n| `context.ip` | `IP` | String |\n| `context.timezone` | `timezone` | String |\n| `traits.subscriptionStatus` / `context.traits.subscriptionStatus` | `subscription_status` | String |\n| `traits.prospectOrCustomer` / `context.traits.prospectOrCustomer` | `prospect_or_customer` | String |\n| `traits.hasPurchased` / `context.traits.hasPurchased` | `haspurchased` | String |\n| `traits.state`/ `context.traits.state` | `state` | String |\n| `traits.zipcode` / `context.traits.zipcode` / `traits.zip` / `context.traits.zip` | `zipcode` | String |\n| `traits.country` / `context.traits.country` | `country` | String (Starting with a capital letter) |\n\n### Getting contact details\n\nThe easiest way to retrieve contact details of an existing user in Mautic is by specifying the unique user trait in the **Mautic property name to used as lookup field** dashboard setting. RudderStack will look for this property in the event’s `traits` or `context.traits` and use the value for contact lookup.\n\nIf the events do not contain the property specified in the above setting, then:\n\n*   RudderStack uses the `email` property in the event.\n*   If `email` is not present, RudderStack then [creates a new contact](https://developer.mautic.org/?json#create-contact) in Mautic.\n\nOptionally, you can also pass the contact ID in your event’s `externalId`:\n\n```\n{\n  \"context\": {\n    \"externalId\": [{\n      \"type\": \"mauticContactId\",\n      \"id\": \"1hKOmRA4GRlm\"\n    }]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack checks if `externalId.type` is set to `mauticContactId` before using the `id` field for contact lookup.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> The contact ID passed in your event’s `externalId` takes precedence over the user property specified in the **Mautic property name to used as lookup field** dashboard setting.\n\n## Group\n\nYou can use the [`group`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/group/) call to link or delink a Mautic contact with a segment, campaign, or a company.\n\nA sample `group` call is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.group(\"group01\", {\n  \"name\": \"Alex Keener\",\n  \"type\": \"Segments\",\n  \"operation\": \"add\"\n});\n```\n\nRudderStack uses the `type` trait present in the `group` call to link or delink a Mautic user to a segment, campaign, or company. You can add or remove a user to a group using the `operation` trait. If this field is not explicitly set, RudderStack sets it to `add` by default.\n\nThe following table lists the supported `group` traits:\n\n| RudderStack property | Presence | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `traits.type` | Required | You can set it to `Segments`, `Campaigns`, or `Companies`. |\n| `traits.operation` | Optional | If not set, RudderStack sets it to `add` by default. |\n\nSimilar to the [`identify`](#getting-contact-details) call above, RudderStack retrieves the contact ID from the `group` call in the following order of precedence:\n\n1.  If `externalId` is present, RudderStack checks if the `type` is set to `mauticContactId`. If yes, it uses the `id` field for the contact lookup.\n2.  If you have specified a unique user property in the **Mautic property name to used as lookup field** dashboard setting, RudderStack will look for this property in the event’s `traits` or `context.traits` and use it for the contact lookup.\n3.  If the events do not contain the property specified in the above setting, then:\n    *   RudderStack uses the `email` property in the event.\n    *   If `email` is not present, RudderStack then gives an error.\n\n### Supported mappings\n\nThe following table lists the mappings between the RudderStack and Mautic properties:\n\n*   [Assigning a single contact to a segment](https://developer.mautic.org/?json#add-contact-to-a-segment)\n\n| RudderStack property | Mautic property |\n| --- | --- |\n| `groupId`  <br>`traits.groupId`  <br>Required | `SegmentId` |\n| `traits.email`  <br>`context.traits.email`  <br>Required, if `externalId` and `lookupField` are absent. | `email` |\n| `message.context.externalId[x].id` for type `mauticContactId` | `CONTACT_ID` |\n\n*   [Assigning a contact to a campaign](https://developer.mautic.org/?json#add-contact-to-a-campaign)\n\n| RudderStack property | Mautic property |\n| --- | --- |\n| `groupId`  <br>`traits.groupId`  <br>Required | `CampaignId` |\n| `traits.email`  <br>`context.traits.email`  <br>Required, if `externalId` and `lookupField` are absent. | `email` |\n| `message.context.externalId[x].id` for type `mauticContactId` | `CONTACT_ID` |\n\n*   [Assigning a contact to a company](https://developer.mautic.org/?json#add-contact-to-a-company)\n\n| RudderStack property | Mautic property |\n| --- | --- |\n| `groupId`  <br>`traits.groupId`  <br>Required | `company_id` |\n| `traits.email`  <br>`context.traits.email`  <br>Required, if `externalId` and `lookupField` are absent. | `email` |\n| `message.context.externalId[x].id` for type `mauticContactId` | `CONTACT_ID` |\n\nQuestions?

By default, RudderStack sets it to **Standard** (US) and provides two other options - **EU** (Europe) and **AU** (Australia).\n*   **Send AnonymousId as Secondary UserId**: Toggle on this setting to send anonymous ID as the secondary user ID.\n*   **OneTrust cookie consent settings**: This setting lets you associate the [OneTrust](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/data-governance/consent-management/onetrust/) cookie consent groups to Intercom.\n\n### Connection mode\n\nSpecify how you want to route events from your source to Intercom.\n\nRudderStack supports sending events to Intercom via the following [connection modes](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/):\n\n| Connection mode | Web | Mobile | Server |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Device mode** | **Supported** | **Supported** | \\-  |\n| **Cloud mode** | **Supported** | **Supported** | **Supported** |\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> In a web device mode integration, that is, using [JavaScript SDK](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/) as a source, RudderStack loads the Intercom native SDK from the `https://widget.intercom.io/` domain. Based on your website’s content security policy, you might need to [allowlist this domain](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/load-js-sdk/#allowlist-destination-domain) to load the Intercom SDK successfully.\n\n### Configuration settings\n\nAfter completing the initial setup, configure the following settings to correctly receive your data in Intercom:\n\n*   **Send AnonymousId as Secondary UserId**: Turn on this option to send `anonymousId` as the user ID to Intercom when the `userId` is absent from the event payload.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Note that:\n> \n> *   This setting is applicable only when sending events in cloud mode.\n> *   It is helpful for tracking anonymous users on your site. For more information on the scenario where this setting is useful, see [FAQ](#faq) section below.\n\n*   **Android API Key** / **iOS API Key**: This is required for sending events from your mobile apps to Intercom. You can get it from your Intercom dashboard by going to **Settings** > **Installation** and selecting the relevant platform. Note that this setting is applicable only when sending events in device mode.\n\n#### **Other settings**\n\n*   **Client-side Events Filtering**: This setting lets you specify which events should be blocked or allowed to flow through to Intercom. For more information on this setting, see [Client-side Events Filtering](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/event-filtering/).\n*   **OneTrust Cookie Categories**: This setting lets you associate the [OneTrust](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/data-governance/consent-management/onetrust/javascript/) cookie consent groups to Intercom.\n\n## Adding device mode integration\n\nDepending on your platform of integration, follow the steps below to add Intercom to your project:\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Your Android app must be on **version 5.0 (API level 21) or higher** for RudderStack to be able to send events to Intercom.\n\nFollow these steps to add Intercom to your Android project:\n\n1.  In your app-level `build.gradle` file, add the following `repository`:\n\n```\nrepositories {\n    mavenCentral()\n}\n```\n\n2.  Add the following under `dependencies`:\n\n```\n// Rudder core sdk and intercom extension\nimplementation 'com.rudderstack.android.sdk:core:1.0.2'\nimplementation 'com.rudderstack.android.integration:intercom:0.1.1'\n\n// intercom core sdk\nimplementation 'io.intercom.android:intercom-sdk-base:6.+'\n\n// gson\nimplementation 'com.google.code.gson:gson:2.8.6'\n\n// FCM\nimplementation 'com.google.firebase:firebase-messaging:20.2.0'\n```\n\n3.  Change the SDK initialization as follows:\n\n```\n// initialize Rudder SDK\nval rudderClient: RudderClient =\n    RudderClient.getInstance(\n        this,\n        WRITE_KEY,\n        RudderConfig.Builder()\n            .withDataPlaneUrl(DATA_PLANE_URL)\n            .withFactory(IntercomIntegrationFactory.FACTORY)\n            .build()\n    )\n```\n\nTo add the RudderStack iOS SDK to your project, follow these steps:\n\n1.  Add the required pod followed by `pod install`:\n\n2.  Initialize the SDK as follows:\n\n```\nRSConfigBuilder *builder = [[RSConfigBuilder alloc] init];\n[builder withDataPlaneUrl:DATA_PLANE_URL];\n[builder withFactory:[RudderIntercomFactory instance]];\n[builder withLoglevel:RSLogLevelDebug]; // optional\n[RSClient getInstance:WRITE_KEY config:[builder build]];\n```\n\n3.  Add a **Privacy - Photo Library Usage Description** entry to your `Info.plist`. This is [required by Apple](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/qa/qa1937/_index.html) for applications that can access the photo library.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Users will be prompted for the permission to access the photo library only when they tap the button to upload their images.\n\n## Identify\n\nThe [`identify`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/identify/) call captures the details about a visiting user.\n\nA sample`identify` call is shown:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify(\"1hKOmRA4GRlm\", {\n  name: \"Alex Keener\",\n  email: \"alex@example.com\",\n  company: {\n    id: \"group01\",\n    name: \"Tech Group\",\n  },\n  createdAt: \"Mon May 19 2019 18:34:24 GMT+0000 (UTC)\",\n})\n```\n\n### Using `identify` calls\n\nYou can use the `identify` call to create or update user information in Intercom, as explained below:\n\n*   **Create/update a user**: When you make an`identify` call, RudderStack creates or updates the user in Intercom.\n*   **Remove users from a company**: To remove users from a company, you can pass `remove: true` inside the `company` object:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify(\"1hKOmRA4GRlm\", {\n  name: \"Alex Keener\",\n  email: \"alex@example.com\",\n  company: {\n    id: \"group01\",\n    name: \"Tech Group\",\n    remove: true\n  },\n  createdAt: \"Mon May 19 2019 18:34:24 GMT+0000 (UTC)\",\n})\n```\n\n*   **Unsubscribe users**: To unsubscribe users from emails, you can pass `unsubscribedFromEmails: true` inside the `context` object:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify(\"1hKOmRA4GRlm\", {\n  name: \"Alex Keener\",\n  email: \"alex@example.com\",\n  company: {\n    id: \"group01\",\n    name: \"Tech Group\",\n  },\n  unsubscribedFromEmails: true,\n  createdAt: \"Mon May 19 2019 18:34:24 GMT+0000 (UTC)\",\n})\n```\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack does not support Intercom’s **Last Seen** feature currently.\n\n### Traits mapping\n\nThe following table lists the mapping of the RudderStack traits to the Intercom properties:\n\n| RudderStack trait | Intercom property |\n| --- | --- |\n| `userId`  <br>`traits.userId`  <br>`traits.id`  <br>`context.traits.userId`  <br>`context.traits.id`  <br>Required, if `email` is absent. | `external_id` |\n| `traits.email`  <br>`context.traits.email`  <br>Required, if `userId` is absent. | `email` |\n| `traits.phone`  <br>`context.traits.phone` | `phone` |\n| `traits.avatar`  <br>`context.traits.avatar` | `avatar` |\n| `traits.name`  <br>`context.traits.name` | `name` |\n| `traits.role`  <br>`context.traits.role` | `role` |\n| `traits.ownerId`  <br>`context.traits.ownerId` | `owner_id` |\n| `traits.createdAt`  <br>`context.traits.createdAt` | `signed_up_at` |\n| `traits.unsubscribedFromEmails`  <br>`context.traits.unsubscribedFromEmails` | `unsubscribed_from_emails` |\n| `context.traits.lastSeenAt`  <br>`last_seen_at` | `last_seen_at` |\n\n### Identity verification\n\nIntercom’s [identity verification](https://www.intercom.com/help/en/articles/183-enable-identity-verification-for-web-and-mobile) feature ensures the privacy of the conversations between you and your users. It also makes sure that one user cannot impersonate another.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack supports the identity verification feature for the events sent through the **web device mode**.\n\nTo use the identity verification feature in web device mode, you can pass `user_hash` within the [integrations](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/load-js-sdk/#integrationopts) object, as shown in the following snippet:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify(\n  \"1hKOmRA4GRlm\", {\n    name: \"Alex Keener\",\n    country: \"USA\"\n  }, {\n    Intercom: {\n      user_hash: \"9c56cc51b374c3ba189210d5b6d4bf57790d351c96c47c02190ecf1e430635ab\",\n    },\n  }\n);\n```\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> The `user_hash` is a SHA256 hash of your Intercom API secret and the `userId`. Note that this hash is **not** based on the user’s email.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> To obtain your Intercom API secret, go to your Intercom dashboard and navigate to **Settings** > **Apps & Integrations** > **Developer Hub**. Then select your app and go to **Configure** > **Basic information**. You will find the API secret listed here under **Client secret**.\n\n### Deleting a user\n\nYou can delete a user in Intercom using the [Suppression with Delete regulation](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/api/user-suppression-api/#adding-a-suppression-with-delete-regulation) of the RudderStack [User Suppression API](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/api/user-suppression-api/).\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> To delete a user, you must specify their `userId` in the event. Additionally, you can specify a custom identifier (optional) in the event.\n\nA sample regulation request body for deleting a user in Intercom is shown below:\n\n```\n{\n  \"regulationType\": \"suppress_with_delete\",\n  \"destinationIds\": [\n    \"2FIKkByqn37FhzczP23eZmURciA\"\n  ],\n  \"users\": [{\n    \"userId\": \"1hKOmRA4GRlm\",\n    \"<customKey>\": \"<customValue>\"\n  }]\n}\n```\n\n## Track\n\nThe [`track`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/track/) call lets you track user’s actions along with any properties associated with those actions.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> You must identify a user with a valid `userId` or `email` before making any `track` calls to Intercom.\n\nA sample `track` call is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"Order Completed\", {\n  order_id: \"140021222\",\n  email: \"alex@example.com\",\n  checkout_id: \"EAP3211\",\n  products: \"Sports Shoes\",\n  total: 145.99,\n  currency: \"USD\"\n})\n```\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Note that:\n> \n> *   To send a `track` call to Intercom successfully, you must include any one of the `userId` or `email` fields.\n> *   RudderStack converts and sends all `track` event properties as per the [Intercom API](https://developers.intercom.com/intercom-api-reference/reference#event-metadata-types).\n\n### Properties mapping\n\nThe following table lists the mapping of the RudderStack `track` properties to the Intercom properties:\n\n| RudderStack property | Intercom property |\n| --- | --- |\n| `userId`  <br>`traits.userId`  <br>`traits.id`  <br>`context.traits.userId`  <br>`context.traits.id`  <br>Required, if `email` is absent. | `user_id` |\n| `traits.email`  <br>`context.traits.email`  <br>Required, if `userId` is absent. | `email` |\n| `event`  <br>Required | `event_name` |\n| `timestamp` | `created` |\n| `properties` | metadata |\n| `properties.id`  <br>`traits.id` | `id` |\n\n## Page\n\nThe [`page`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/page/) call lets you record your website’s page views with any additional relevant information about the viewed page.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> The `page` call is supported **only** for the [JavaScript SDK](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/) when sending events via [device mode](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#device-mode). It works by triggering Intercom’s `update` method, which looks for a list of new open conversations to be displayed to the current user.\n\nA sample `page` call looks like the following code snippet:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.page(\"Best Seller\")\n```\n\n## Group\n\nThe [`group`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/group/) call lets you link an identified user to a group like a company, organization, or an account. Along with that, you can [add tags to a company](https://developers.intercom.com/docs/references/rest-api/api.intercom.io/tags/createtag).\n\nRudderStack uses this information to [create or update a company](https://developers.intercom.com/intercom-api-reference/reference/createorupdatecompany) in Intercom using their `/companies` endpoint.\n\nA sample `group` call is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.group(\"group123\", {\n  name: \"companyName\",\n  industry: \"IT\",\n  employees: 450\n})\n```\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack requires a `groupId` (`group123` in the above example) to send `group` events to Intercom. It maps this field to Intercom’s `company_id` field.\n\n### Supported mappings\n\nThe following table lists the mapping of the RudderStack `group` traits to the Intercom properties:\n\n| RudderStack trait | Intercom property |\n| --- | --- |\n| `groupId`  <br>Required | `company_id` |\n| `name` | `name` |\n| `website` | `website` |\n| `traits.plan`  <br>`context.traits.plan` | `plan` |\n| `traits.size`  <br>`context.traits.size` | `size` |\n| `traits.industry`  <br>`context.traits.industry` | `industry` |\n| `traits.monthlySpend`  <br>`context.traits.monthlySpend` | `monthly_spend` |\n| `traits.remoteCreatedAt`  <br>`context.traits.remoteCreatedAt` | `monthly_spend` |\n| `traits` | `custom_attributes` |\n| `context.traits.tags` | Maps to tag names in Intercom |\n\n## Reset\n\nThe `reset` method resets the previously identified user and any related information.\n\nTo reset user identification in your Android app, run the following command:\n\nTo reset user identification in your iOS app, run the following command:\n\n```\n[[RSClient sharedInstance] reset];\n```\n\n## User lookup\n\nRudderStack supports user lookup in `identify` and `group` calls. By default, it performs the lookup using the `email` field. However, you can provide a custom field for the lookup using the event’s `integrations` object.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> Make sure the field you are passing for the lookup is present in the event.\n\nA sample `identify` event highlighting this feature:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify('1hKOmRA4el9Z', {\n  email: 'alex@example.com',\n  phone: '+1-202-555-0146',\n}, {\n  integrations: {\n    INTERCOM: {\n      lookup: 'phone'\n    }\n  }\n});\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n| Error | Reason | Solution |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Cannot have more than 120 active event names | You have sent more than 120 event names in your `track` calls.<br><br>Once the event limit is reached, Intercom does not store any new events and returns this error. | Archive any unused events in your Intercom dashboard by going to **Settings** > **Intercom Data** > **Events**.<br><br>See [Intercom documentation](https://www.intercom.com/help/en/articles/5245634-event-limits-troubleshooting-and-f-a-q#h_9b866dcfb0) for more information. |\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### Does RudderStack support Intercom’s push notification and deep linking features?\n\nNone of the RudderStack SDKs support push notifications and deep linking features currently. See [Intercom documentation](https://developers.intercom.com/installing-intercom/docs) for more information on configuring these features for your project.\n\n#### What happens if both `userId` or `email` are missing in the `identify` / `track` calls sent to Intercom?\n\nFor both `identify` and `track` calls, either `userId` or `email` is a mandatory field. In case both these fields are missing, RudderStack will drop the event.\n\nIt is highly recommended to toggle on the [Send AnonymousId as Secondary UserId](#connection-settings) setting in your RudderStack dashboard to avoid any event loss in such a scenario.\n\nQuestions?

It helps you better understand how users are interacting with your website through session replays and heatmaps.\n\n## Getting started\n\nRudderStack supports sending event data to Microsoft Clarity via the following [connection modes](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/):\n\n| Connection Mode | Web | Mobile | Server |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Device mode | Supported | \\-  | \\-  |\n| Cloud mode | \\-  | \\-  | \\-  |\n\nOnce you have confirmed that the source platform supports sending events to Microsoft Clarity, follow these steps:\n\n1.  From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add a source. Then, from the list of destinations, select **Microsoft Clarity**.\n2.  Assign a name to the destination and click **Continue**.\n\n## Connection settings\n\nTo successfully configure Microsoft Clarity as a destination, you will need to configure the following settings:\n\n*   **Project ID**: Enter your Microsoft Clarity project ID. For more information on obtaining your Clarity project ID, refer to the [FAQ](#faq) section below.\n*   **Microsoft Clarity Cookie Consent**: Enable this setting to allow RudderStack to call the Microsoft Clarity API to track the users using a cookie.\n*   **Client-side Events Filtering**: This setting lets you specify which events should be blocked or allowed to flow through to Microsoft Clarity. For more information on this setting, refer to the [Client-side Events Filtering](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/event-filtering/) guide.\n*   **Use device mode to send events**: As this is a [web device mode](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#device-mode)\\-only destination, this setting is enabled by default and cannot be disabled.\n*   **OneTrust Cookie Categories**: This setting lets you associate [OneTrust](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/data-governance/consent-management/onetrust/javascript/) cookie consent groups to Microsoft Clarity.\n\n## Identify\n\nYou can use the [`identify`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/identify/) events to create a new user in Microsoft Clarity.\n\nA sample `identify` call is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify(\"1hKOmRA4GRlm\", {\n  name: \"Alex Keener\",\n  email: \"alex@example.com\"\n});\n```\n\nBy default, Clarity uses cookies to track your users and gather the session data. You can configure your Clarity project to require [cookie consent](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/clarity/cookie-consent), that is, Clarity **will not** place a cookie until a user provides consent.\n\n[![Microsoft Clarity cookie consent enabled](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/clarity-cookie-consent.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/clarity-cookie-consent.webp)\n\nIn this case, to track the user sessions via the cookie, make sure you enable the **Microsoft Clarity Cookie Consent** setting in the RudderStack dashboard. This setting indicates that RudderStack can call the Clarity API to track the users via a cookie once a user provides consent.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> If the **Cookies** setting is enabled in the Clarity project settings, then you need not enable the **Microsoft Clarity Cookie Consent** dashboard setting.\n\n### Supported mappings\n\nRudderStack maps the following `identify` attributes to the corresponding Microsoft Clarity properties:\n\n| RudderStack property | Microsoft Clarity property |\n| --- | --- |\n| `userId`  <br>Required | `customuserid` |\n| `context.sessionId` | `customsessionid` |\n| `context.traits.customPageId` | `custompageid` |\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### Where can I find the Microsoft Clarity project ID?\n\nTo get your Microsoft Clarity project ID, follow these steps:\n\n1.  Log into your [Microsoft Clarity dashboard](https://clarity.microsoft.com/projects).\n2.  Select your Microsoft Clarity project and go to **Settings** > **Overview** to get your project ID:\n\n[![Microsoft Clarity project ID](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/clarity-project-id.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/clarity-project-id.webp)\n\nQuestions?

    "markdown": "# Intercom API v2.10 Migration Details\n\nConfiguration changes and differences in sending events when migrating from Intercom API v1.4 to v2.10.\n\n* * *\n\n*     4 minute read  \n    \n\nThis changelog contains the implementation and configuration changes while migrating your Intercom [cloud mode](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#cloud-mode) integration from Intercom API v1.4 to v2.10.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> For the existing users of the Intercom destination integration (based on API v1.4), the RudderStack team will do all the necessary migrations internally.\n\n## Configuration changes\n\nThe following configuration settings are removed from the RudderStack dashboard as they are no longer supported in Intercom API v2.10:\n\n| Setting | Comments |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Include Context with Identify Calls** | \\-  |\n| **Enable this to update the last seen to the current time** | Used to enable the `update_last_request_at` parameter in Intercom. |\n\nThe following configuration setting is added:\n\n| Setting | Comments |\n| --- | --- |\n| **API Server** | Select your Intercom workspace server.<br><br>By default, RudderStack sets it to **Standard** (US) and provides two other options: **EU** (Europe) and **AU** (Australia). |\n\nMake sure to review the following sections to accurately send your events to Intercom.\n\n### Set the API server\n\nA new configuration setting **API Server** is introduced in the new Intercom implementation. For migrating all the existing destination integrations, RudderStack will set this field to **Standard** by default.\n\nIf you have an existing Intercom destination integration and your Intercom regional hosting is either **EU** or **AU**, make sure to update this setting in the dashboard.\n\n### Send custom attributes\n\n**You need to ensure that the custom attributes you are sending to Intercom in your `identify` and `group` events are defined in the Intercom dashboard already. Otherwise, your events might fail.**\n\nRudderStack supports sending custom attributes (`custom_attributes`) to Intercom at a user and company level (`identify` and `group` calls).\n\nIn the older implementation leveraging Intercom API v1.4, you could send a custom attribute that was not defined in the Intercom dashboard already. Intercom did not validate the attribute and created a new custom attribute instead. In the new implementation, Intercom validates the custom attribute first, meaning it throws an error if a custom attribute present in the event is not defined in the Intercom dashboard already.\n\nFor more information on creating and sending custom attributes to Intercom, see the [Intercom documentation](https://www.intercom.com/help/en/articles/179-send-custom-user-attributes-to-intercom).\n\n#### **Use case**\n\nThe following use case highlights how RudderStack considers and sends custom attributes to Intercom in the new API implementation.\n\nSuppose you send the following `identify` call to Intercom:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify(\n  \"alex98\", {\n    name: \"Alex Keener\",\n    createdAt: \"2024-01-05T19:11:00.337Z\",\n    email: \"alex@example.com\",\n    phone: \"+800 555‑0100\",\n    address: {\n      city: \"New Orleans\",\n      state: \"Louisiana\",\n    },\n    plan: \"enterprise\",\n  }, {\n    integrations: {\n      INTERCOM: {\n        lookup: \"phone\",\n      },\n    },\n  });\n```\n\nFirst, RudderStack extracts the following standard Intercom attributes from the event payload:\n\n*   `userId`\n*   `email`\n*   `phone`\n*   `name`\n*   `createdAt`\n\n**Standard Intercom attributes for `identify` and `group` calls**\n\n**Identify**\n\n*   `userId`\n*   `role`\n*   `email`\n*   `phone`\n*   `name`\n*   `avatar`\n*   `company`\n*   `ownerId`\n*   `lastName`\n*   `lastname`\n*   `firstName`\n*   `firstname`\n*   `createdAt`\n*   `timestamp`\n*   `lastSeenAt`\n*   `originalTimestamp`\n*   `unsubscribedFromEmails`\n\n**Group**\n\n*   `tags`\n*   `size`\n*   `plan`\n*   `name`\n*   `email`\n*   `userId`\n*   `website`\n*   `industry`\n*   `segments`\n*   `userCount`\n*   `createdAt`\n*   `sessionCount`\n*   `monthlySpend`\n*   `remoteCreatedAt`\n\nRudderStack considers all the other attributes/properties as custom attributes.\n\nNote that if the custom attributes are a part of an object, then RudderStack flattens them, so the `custom_attribute` object in the final event payload sent to Intercom looks like the following:\n\n```\n\"custom_attributes\": {\n  \"address_city\": \"New Orleans\",\n  \"address_state\": \"Louisiana\",\n  \"plan\": \"enterprise\"\n}\n```\n\nMake sure to create the above custom attributes in the Intercom dashboard to successfully send the events.\n\n### Attribute lookup\n\nRudderStack supports user lookup in the `identify` and `group` calls. By default, it does a lookup based on the user’s `email`. However, you can change this behavior by passing the required field in the `integrations` object.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> For a successful lookup, make sure to pass a valid field with its value present in the event payload.\n\nA sample `identify` call highlighting the user lookup:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify(\n  \"alex98\", {\n    name: \"Alex Keener\",\n    email: \"alex@example.com\",\n    phone: \"+800 555‑0100\"\n  }, {\n    integrations: {\n      INTERCOM: {\n        lookup: \"phone\",\n      },\n    },\n  });\n```\n\n### Send last seen timestamp\n\nIn the older Intercom version, RudderStack supported the **Enable this to update the last seen to the current time** dashboard setting that lets you enable the last seen timestamp (`update_last_request_at` parameter) for a contact in Intercom.\n\nThis feature is no longer supported in the new Intercom API v2.1. To update the last seen timestamp of a contact, you can send the `lastSeenAt` field in the event payload.\n\nQuestions?

Alternatively, you can also use an already existing bucket.\n*   You will need to provide `access key ID` and `secret access key` to authorize RudderStack to write to your bucket.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> `access key ID` is the user ID that uniquely identifies your MinIO account, and `secret access key` is the password to your account.\n\n*   Make a note of both the `access key ID` and `secret access key` as these will be required while configuring MinIO as a destination.\n\n## Configuring MinIO in RudderStack\n\nIn order to enable dumping data to MinIO, you will first need to add it as a destination to the source from which you are sending event data. Once the destination is enabled, events from RudderStack will start to flow to MinIO. You will start seeing the files created in your MinIO bucket.\n\nTo do so, please follow these steps:\n\n*   Choose a source to which you would like to add MinIO as a destination. You can also simply create a destination and connect it to a source later.\n*   Select the destination as **MinIO** to your source. Give your destination a name and then click **Next**.\n*   Next, in the **Connection Settings**, fill all fields with the relevant information (please refer to the [Setting up MinIO](#setting-up-minio) section above) and click **Next**.\n\n[![](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/screenshot-2020-02-26-at-7.22.29-pm.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/screenshot-2020-02-26-at-7.22.29-pm.webp)\n\nMinIO connection settings\n\n*   If you need any transformation, choose one from the list.

This reduces the number of API calls and enables faster event delivery.\n\n## Identify\n\nWhen you make an `identify` call, RudderStack calls Iterable’s [Update User](https://api.iterable.com/api/docs#users_updateUser) API to send the data.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> Iterable identifies a user by `email` or `userId`. If none of these traits is present in the call, RudderStack will not send the event to Iterable.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Iterable gives precedence to `email` over `userId` in case both the traits are present in the `identify` call.\n\nA sample `identify` call is as shown:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify(\n  \"userId\",\n  {\n    city: \"New Orleans\",\n    name: \"Alex Keener\",\n    email: \"alex@example.com\",\n    country: \"USA\"\n  }\n);\n```\n\n### Deleting a user\n\nYou can delete a user in Iterable using the [Suppression with Delete regulation](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/api/user-suppression-api/#adding-a-suppression-with-delete-regulation) of RudderStack’s [User Suppression API](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/api/user-suppression-api/).\n\nFor more information on deleting users in Iterable, see [Iterable’s API documentation](https://api.iterable.com/api/docs#users_delete).\n\nTo delete a user, you must specify their `userId` in the event.\n\nA sample regulation request body for deleting a user in Iterable:\n\n```\n{\n  \"regulationType\": \"suppress_with_delete\",\n  \"destinationIds\": [\n    \"2FIKkByqn37FhzczP23eZmURciA\"\n  ],\n  \"users\": [{\n      \"userId\": \"1hKOmRA4GRlm\",\n    }\n  ],\n}\n```\n\n### Push notification registration\n\nRudderStack uses Iterable’s [device registration API](https://api.iterable.com/api/docs#users_registerDeviceToken) to send the token information from a device. It also sets the `platform` parameter to `APNS` and `GCM` for iOS and Android devices respectively.\n\nSimilarly, RudderStack uses Iterable’s [browser token registration API](https://api.iterable.com/api/docs#users_registerBrowserToken) for the web platform.\n\nIf the `deviceToken` associated with the push notification is present in `context` of the event payload, then RudderStack will map the user with the device to register for push. This will add the data if it doesn’t exist yet. It will also update data fields on the device.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> To learn more about Iterable’s push notification registration feature for mobile devices, refer to their [Android](https://support.iterable.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000331943#_2-create-a-mobile-app-in-iterable) and [iOS](https://support.iterable.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000315806#_4-create-a-mobile-app-in-iterable) documentation.\n\n## Page\n\nWhen you call the `page` method, the RudderStack sends a `track` event to Iterable with the `userId`, `email`, and `eventName` parameters. If the user does not already exist in Iterable, RudderStack will add them to the system as long as `email` is present in the event. If `email` is not present, Iterable will reject the event.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Iterable requires `email` for the first time you call `page` for a given user. The subsequent events can contain `userId`.\n\nIf the name of your page is `Application Home`, then RudderStack sends the event to Iterable as `Application Home Page`.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> The event name will differ according to the settings you specify in the RudderStack dashboard. Refer to the [Connection settings](#connection-settings) section above for more information.\n\nA sample `page` call is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.page({\n  path: \"home\",\n  url: \"https://www.example.com/home\",\n  title: \"Home Page\",\n  search: \"home\",\n  referrer: \"https://www.example.com/previous\",\n})\n```\n\n## Screen\n\nThe `screen` event is the mobile equivalent of the `page`. When you make a `screen` call, RudderStack sends a `track` event to Iterable with the `userId`,`email`, and `eventName` parameters . If a user corresponding to the email ID is absent, Iterable will create a new user.\n\nIf the name of your screen is `Main Activity`, RudderStack sends the event to Iterable as `Main Activity Screen`.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> The event name will differ according to the settings you specify in the RudderStack dashboard. Refer to the [Connection settings](#connection-settings) section above for more information.\n\nA sample `screen` call is as shown:\n\n```\n[[RSClient sharedInstance] screen:@\"Main\"];\n```\n\n## Alias\n\nThe `alias` call lets you merge different identities of a known user. The format of an `alias` call is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.alias(\"userId\",\"previousId\");\n```\n\nTo send an `alias` event to Iterable, you must set `previousId` to the current email and `userId` as new email:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.alias(\"new@email.com\", \"current@email.com\");\n```\n\n## Track\n\nWhen you make a `track` call, RudderStack uses Iterable’s [Track API](https://api.iterable.com/api/docs#events_track) to send the events. The event properties are sent as data fields in the request, while the name of the event is sent as a custom event.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> Iterable requires `email` for the first time you send a `track` event for a given user. If a user does not exist, Iterable creates new users for those `track` calls which have `email`.\n\nA sample`track` call is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\n  \"Email Opened\", {\n    \"subject\": \"Resume validation\",\n    \"sendtime\": \"2022-01-01\",\n    \"sendlocation\": \"alex@example.com\"\n  }, {\n    traits: {\n      email: \"alex@example.com\"\n    }\n  }\n);\n```\n\n## Ecommerce\n\nYou can find the relevant details of the ecommerce events in the [Ecommerce Events Specification](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/ecommerce-events-spec/).\n\n### Order Completed\n\nRudderStack supports the ecommerce event `Order Completed` and sends the other events as generic `track` events. Refer to the corresponding Iterable endpoint details in the [Track a purchase API](https://api.iterable.com/api/docs#commerce_trackPurchase).\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack requires the user properties, item properties, and `total` to successfully send the **Order Completed** event.\n\nThe following snippet highlights a sample `Order Completed` event:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"Order Completed\", {\n  total: 1000,\n  products: [\n    {\n      product_id: \"507f1f77bcf86cd799439011\",\n      sku: \"45790-32\",\n      name: \"Monopoly: 3rd Edition\",\n      price: \"19\",\n      position: \"1\",\n      category: \"Games,Gifts,Entertainment,Toys\",\n      url: \"https://www.example.com/product/path\",\n      image_url: \"https://www.example.com/product/path.jpg\",\n    },\n    {\n      product_id: \"507f1f77bcf86cd799439011\",\n      sku: \"45790-32\",\n      name: \"Monopoly: 3rd Edition\",\n      price: \"19\",\n      quantity: \"2\",\n      position: \"1\",\n      category: \"Games,Gifts,Entertainment,Toys\",\n      url: \"https://www.example.com/product/path\",\n      image_url: \"https://www.example.com/product/path.jpg\",\n    },\n  ],\n})\n```\n\n### Product Added / Product Removed\n\nRudderStack supports the ecommerce event `Product Added` or `Product Removed` and sends the information to Iterable via the [updateCart endpoint](https://api.iterable.com/api/docs#commerce_updateCart), corresponding to updating a user’s shopping cart items.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack requires the user and item properties to successfully send the **Order Completed** event to Iterable. Also, you must send the whole updated cart details and not just the updated individual items added/removed from the cart.\n\nA sample snippet highlighting the `Product Added` event is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"Product Added\", {\n  total: 1000,\n  products: [\n    {\n      product_id: \"507f1f77bcf86cd799439011\",\n      sku: \"45790-32\",\n      name: \"Monopoly: 3rd Edition\",\n      price: \"19\",\n      position: \"1\",\n      category: \"Games,Gifts,Entertainment,Toys\",\n      url: \"https://www.example.com/product/path\",\n      image_url: \"https://www.example.com/product/path.jpg\",\n    },\n    {\n      product_id: \"507f1f77bcf86cd799439011\",\n      sku: \"45790-32\",\n      name: \"Monopoly: 3rd Edition\",\n      price: \"19\",\n      quantity: \"2\",\n      position: \"1\",\n      category: \"Games,Gifts,Entertainment,Toys\",\n      url: \"https://www.example.com/product/path\",\n      image_url: \"https://www.example.com/product/path.jpg\",\n    },\n  ],\n})\n```\n\nQuestions?

It also lets you record any traits about them like their name, email, etc.\n\nWhen you send an `identify` event via Rudderstack, Lemnisk’s [`identify`](https://lemnisk.gitbook.io/lemnisk-platform-documentation/events/identify) event is triggered. Lemnisk needs a unique user ID to associate an event with a user. By default, it uses a cookie to identify the user. Optionally, you can also pass a unique user ID in the first parameter of the `identify` call.\n\nA sample `identify` call is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify(\"hashed_user_id\", {\n  name: \"Alex Keener\",\n  email: \"alex@example.com\",\n})\n```\n\n### Property mappings\n\nThe following table lists the mappings between the RudderStack and Lemnisk properties:\n\n| RudderStack property | Lemnisk property | Data type |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `userId`  <br>`anonymousId`  <br>Required | `userId` | String |\n| `traits` | `customerProperties` | Object |\n\n## Track\n\nThe [`track`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/track/) call lets you record the user actions along with any properties associated with them.

You can configure this using the [Identifier to identify a user over a session](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/iterable/setting-up-iterable/#web-sdk-settings) setting in the RudderStack dashboard.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Making an `identify` call is necessary to associate the `track` events and trigger the web push notifications for an identified user.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> By default, RudderStack prioritizes `email` over `userId`.\n\nA sample `identify` call is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify(\"\", {\n    \"email\": \"alex@example.com\"\n},{ \"integrations\": {\n    \"ITERABLE\": {\n        \"jwt_token\" : \"eyJhbGciOiJIUzXXXXXXXXX6IkpXVCJ9.eyJlbXXXXXXXXhc2hhc3ZpQHJ1ZGRlcnN0XXXXXXXXXXdCI6MTY2NTAzMTkzNCwiZXhwIjXXXXXXXXxNjY2MDMxOTM0fQ.u0wwq6YOB2GXXXXXXXXX2O9GUpW6BHRF5PCmk\"\n    }\n}})\n```\n\nWhen you call `identify`, RudderStack initializes the SDK using the `email`/`userId` and the JWT token from the `integrations` object.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack **does not** automatically generate JWT tokens on the users’ behalf to initialize the Iterable web SDK for security reasons. You need to set a specific authorization logic within your web app to generate a JWT before you can start making requests using the SDK.\n\n## Track\n\nRudderStack supports the following three types of [`track`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/track/) events in web device mode:\n\n### Purchase events\n\nYou can map certain `track` events to Iterable’s purchase events ([API reference](https://api.iterable.com/api/docs#commerce_trackPurchase)) by specifying them in the [Mapping to trigger the purchase events](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/iterable/setting-up-iterable/#web-sdk-settings) setting of the RudderStack dashboard:\n\n[![Iterable connection settings](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/iterable-purchaseevents.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/iterable-purchaseevents.webp)\n\nA sample `track` call for a purchase event is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"purchase event\", {\n  checkout_id: \"12345\",\n  order_id: \"1234\",\n  affiliation: \"Apple Store\",\n  total: 20,\n  revenue: 15.0,\n  shipping: 22,\n  tax: 1,\n  discount: 1.5,\n  coupon: \"ImagePro\",\n  currency: \"USD\",\n  products: [{\n      product_id: \"123\",\n      sku: \"G-15\",\n      name: \"Chess\",\n      price: 14,\n      quantity: 1,\n      category: \"Games\",\n      url: \"https://www.mywebsite.com/product/path\",\n      image_url: \"https://www.mywebsite.com/product/path.jpg\",\n    }\n  ],\n})\n```\n\nThe following table lists the mappings between the RudderStack event properties and the Iterable properties in case of the purchase events:\n\n| RudderStack property | Iterable property |\n| --- | --- |\n| `properties.name`  <br>Required | `items[].name` |\n| `properties.order_id`  <br>`properties.checkout_id`  <br>Required | `id` |\n| `properties.total`  <br>Required | `total` |\n| `properties.product_id` | `items[].id` |\n| `properties.sku` | `items[].sku` |\n| `properties.price` | `items[].price` |\n| `properties.quantity` | `items[].quantity` |\n| `properties.image_url` | `items[].url` |\n\nThe above properties can be passed in any of the following ways:\n\n*   `properties` object (for a single product), as shown in the above table.\n*   `products` array as multiple objects (for multiple products), for example, `properties.products[0].name`. One example where you can have an array of products is the [Order Completed](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/ecommerce-events-spec/ordering/#order-completed) event.\n\n### `getInAppMessages` events\n\nYou can send this type of `track` events to track the users in-app activities and accordingly display pop-up messages and push notifications for them. The below image shows an example of a web push notification:\n\n[![Iterable connection settings](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/web-push-notifications-iterable.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/web-push-notifications-iterable.webp)\n\nYou can also customize the display configuration for the push notifications using the [In-app message settings](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/iterable/setting-up-iterable/#in-app-message-settings) in the RudderStack dashboard.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> In case multiple `getInAppMessages` events are triggered, the SDK delivers all queued in-app notifications.\n\nA sample `track` call mapped to Iterable’s `getInAppMessages` events is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"trigger event\",{})\n```\n\n### Custom events\n\nRudderStack sends all `track` events that are not mapped to Iterable’s purchase events or `getInAppMessages` events as custom events.\n\nA sample custom `track` event is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\n  \"custom event\", {\n    custom_id: \"22222\",\n    name: \"Some item\",\n    website_url: \"http://www.exampledomain.com/products/some-item\",\n  })\n```\n\nThe following table lists the mappings between the RudderStack event properties and the Iterable properties in case of the custom events:\n\n| RudderStack property | Iterable property |\n| --- | --- |\n| `event`  <br>Required | `eventName` |\n| `userId`  <br>Required, if email is not present. | `userId` |\n| `context.traits.email`  <br>Required, if userId is not present. | `email` |\n| `properties` | `dataFields` |\n\nQuestions?

    "markdown": "# Mixpanel Cloud Mode Integration | RudderStack Docs\n\nSend events to Mixpanel using RudderStack cloud mode.\n\n* * *\n\n*     8 minute read  \n    \n\nAfter you have successfully instrumented Mixpanel as a destination in RudderStack, follow this guide to correctly send your events to Mixpanel in [cloud mode](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#cloud-mode).\n\nFind the open source transformer code for this destination in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-transformer/tree/master/src/v0/destinations/mp).\n\n## Identify\n\nYou can use the [`identify`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/identify/) call to create or update a user in Mixpanel.\n\nMixpanel needs an identifier to uniquely identify a user. If you pass `userId` and `anonymousId` along with the Mixpanel API Secret (in the dashboard settings), then RudderStack first makes an `identify` call to Mixpanel using the `userId` and the `traits`. RudderStack then passes the `userId` and `anonymousId` via Mixpanel’s [Merge Identities](https://developer.mixpanel.com/reference/identity-merge) feature, so that the two identifiers are glued to a single user profile.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> Note the following when sending events to Mixpanel in [cloud mode](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/):\n> \n> *   You can only create a new user in Mixpanel using `identify` events if you have selected the **Simplified ID Merge** dashboard setting. To perform identity merging, you need to use the [`track`](#track) or [`page`/`screen`](#page) calls.\n> *   When sending events to Mixpanel with **Simplified ID Merge**, RudderStack recommends passing `deviceId` generated by the Mixpanel SDK as `anonymousId` in the RudderStack server-side calls to merge two profiles together successfully. For more information, see [Mixpanel User Profiles documentation](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/en-us/articles/14377628688788#user-profiles).\n\nA sample `identify` call is as shown:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify(\"12345\", {\n  firstname: \"Alex\",\n  city: \"New Orleans\",\n  country: \"USA\",\n  phone: \"8005550100\",\n  email: \"alex@example.com\"\n})\n```\n\nYou can prevent the `$last_seen` attribute getting updated with incorrect times by setting `active` to `false` in the `context` object, as shown in the following snippet:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify(\"12345\", {\n  firstname: \"Alex\",\n  city: \"New Orleans\",\n  country: \"USA\"\n}, {\n  context: {\n    active: false\n  }\n})\n```\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Setting `active` to `false` sets Mixpanel’s `$ignore_time` attribute to `true`. This way, you can bypass the “Last Seen” date property.\n\n### Property mappings\n\nWhen sending events in cloud mode, RudderStack maps the following properties to the Mixpanel properties before sending them over Mixpanel’s HTTP API.\n\n| RudderStack property | Mixpanel property |\n| --- | --- |\n| `traits.createdAt` | `$created` |\n| `traits.email` | `$email` |\n| `traits.firstName` | `$firstName` |\n| `traits.lastName` | `$lastName` |\n| `traits.name` | `$name` |\n| `traits.username` | `$username` |\n| `traits.phone` | `$phone` |\n| `traits.avatar` | `$avatar` |\n| `context.ip`  <br>`request_ip` | `ip` or `$ip` |\n| `context.campaign.name` | `campaign_id` |\n| `context.page.url` | `$current_url` |\n| `context.os.name` | `$os` |\n| `context.page.referrer` | `$referrer` |\n| `context.network.carrier` | `$carrier` |\n| `address.city` | `$city` |\n| `address.country` | `$country_code` |\n| `address.region` | `$region` |\n| `context.location.latitude` | `$latitude` |\n| `context.location.longitude` | `$longitude` |\n| `context.page.manufacturer` | `$manufacturer` |\n| `context.device.model` | `$model` |\n| `context.screen.width` | `$screen_width` |\n| `context.screen.height` | `$screen_height` |\n| `context.network.wifi` | `$wifi` |\n| `context.location.geoSource` | `$geoSource` |\n| `context.traits.unsubscribed` | `$unsubscribed` |\n| `traits.unsubscribed` | `$unsubscribed` |\n| `properties.unsubscribed` | `$unsubscribed` |\n| `context.location.timezone` | `$timezone` |\n\n### Properties to set only once\n\nRudderStack lets you set the `identify` traits as Mixpanel properties whose values you do not want to change at the user profile level, that is, Mixpanel will not overwrite the existing property values. See [Mixpanel documentation](https://developer.mixpanel.com/reference/profile-set-property-once/) for more information on this feature.\n\nTo use this feature, add the `identify` traits in the **Properties to set only once** setting.\n\n[![](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/mixpanel-properties-set-once.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/mixpanel-properties-set-once.webp)\n\nRudderStack expects the traits specified in the above field to be present in the `message.traits` or `message.context.traits` (`message.traits` has higher precedence) object within the `identify` event.\n\nFor example, if your `identify` event contains the following and you specify `address.city` in the **Properties to set only once** field:\n\n```\n\"traits\": {\n  \"address\": {\n    \"city\": \"London\"\n  }\n}\n\n...\n\n\"context\": {\n  \"traits\": {\n    \"address\": {\n      \"city\": \"Berlin\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThen, RudderStack maps `city` as `London` as the `traits` object gets precedence over `context.traits`.\n\n### Reserved Mixpanel properties\n\nMixpanel has some reserved properties:\n\n*   `$first_name`\n*   `$last_name`\n*   `$name`\n*   `$username`\n*   `$created`\n*   `$email`\n*   `$phone`\n*   `$avatar`\n*   `$city`\n*   `$country_code`\n*   `$region`\n*   `$unsubscribed`\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> You should not create custom properties that begin with a `$` sign.\n\n### Deleting a user\n\nYou can delete a user in Mixpanel using the [Suppression with Delete regulation](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/api/user-suppression-api/#adding-a-suppression-with-delete-regulation) of RudderStack’s [User Suppression API](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/api/user-suppression-api/).\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> To delete a user, you must specify their `userId` in the event. Additionally, you can specify a custom identifier (optional) in the event.\n\nA sample regulation request body for deleting a user in Mixpanel is shown below:\n\n```\n{\n  \"regulationType\": \"suppress_with_delete\",\n  \"destinationIds\": [\n    \"2FIKkByqn37FhzczP23eZmURciA\"\n  ],\n  \"users\": [{\n    \"userId\": \"1hKOmRA4GRlm\",\n    \"<customKey>\": \"<customValue>\"\n  }]\n}\n```\n\nRudderStack internally uses the deletion API specified in the **User Deletion** dashboard setting. For more information on these deletion APIs, see [Connection settings](#connection-settings).\n\n[![Mixpanel user deletion API](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/mixpanel-user-deletion.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/mixpanel-user-deletion.webp)\n\nTo see the deletion requests created by RudderStack using the **Delete Profile and Associated Events** option, log in to your Mixpanel dashboard and navigate to **Organization Settings** > **Data & Privacy**.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> Deletion requests created using the **Delete Profile** API are not shown in this dashboard.\n\n[![Mixpanel user deletion requests](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/mixpanel-deletion-requests.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/mixpanel-deletion-requests.webp)\n\n## Track\n\nTo track user events, use the [`track`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/track/) method with the event name and the associated properties.\n\nWhen you select **Simplified ID Merge** in the **Identity Merge** dashboard setting, RudderStack sets the event’s `userId` and `anonymousId` using Mixpanel’s [Simplified ID Merge API](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/en-us/articles/14377628688788) so that the two identifiers are glued to a single user profile.\n\nA sample `track` call is as shown:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"track event\", {\n    test_prop1: 50,\n    test_prop2: \"prop_value\"\n});\n```\n\n### Track revenue\n\nMixpanel lets you track revenue events. If you send `revenue` as a property in your `track` event, RudderStack tracks it as a revenue event.\n\nRevenue tracking is done with a `distinct_id` (`userId` that you provide in your `identify` call; if `userId` is not present then it will be associated with an `anonymousId`.)\n\nA sample revenue `track` call is as shown:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"Purchase\", {\n  revenue: 100,\n  currency: \"USD\"\n});\n```\n\n### Track charge\n\nIf **Use Mixpanel People** setting is toggled on in your RudderStack dashboard and you include `revenue` as an event property, RudderStack will track a charge for the current user.\n\n## Page\n\nRudderStack passes all page properties that you provide via the [`page`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/page/) call to Mixpanel, along with the other default properties. It sets the event name as **Page** for a `page` call and **Screen** for a [`screen`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/screen/) call.\n\nWhen you select **Simplified ID Merge** in the **Identity Merge** dashboard setting, RudderStack sets the event’s `userId` and `anonymousId` using Mixpanel’s [Simplified ID Merge API](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/en-us/articles/14377628688788) so that the two identifiers are glued to a single user profile.\n\nA sample `page` call is shown below:\n\n## Screen\n\nThe [`screen`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/screen/) method lets you record whenever a user sees their mobile screen along with any optional properties about the viewed screen.\n\nA sample `screen` call is shown below:\n\n```\n[[RSClient sharedInstance] screen:@\"Sample Screen Name\" properties:@{@\"prop_key\" : @\"prop_value\"}];\n```\n\n## Alias\n\nThe [`alias`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/alias/) call lets you associate multiple identities of a known user.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> The `alias` call is deprecated with the **Simplified ID Merge** dashboard setting.\n\nA sample `alias` call is as shown:\n\n```\nanalytics.alias('userId', `previousId`);\n```\n\n## Group\n\nThe [`group`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/group/) call lets you link an identified user with a group such as a company, organization, or an account, and record any traits associated with that group, for example, company name, number of employees, etc. For more information on how the `group` call works in Mixpanel, see Mixpanel’s [Group Analytics](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/en-us/articles/360025333632-Group-Analytics) documentation.\n\nRudderStack lets you record the custom traits associated with a user group and send this information to Mixpanel.\n\nA sample `group` call is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.group(\n  \"sample_group_id\", {\n    name: \"Tech group\",\n    industry: \"Technology\",\n    employees: 100,\n  }\n);\n```\n\n### Group key\n\nYou can create group keys in the [Mixpanel project settings](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/en-us/articles/360025333632-Group-Analytics#implementation), which act as the group identifiers in Mixpanel. To successfully send a `group` call to Mixpanel, you must specify **at least** one group key in the **Group Key** RudderStack dashboard setting:\n\n[![Mixpanel group key settings](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/mixpanel-group-key-settings.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/mixpanel-group-key-settings.webp)\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> Note the following:\n> \n> *   If you map the `groupId` as a group key, RudderStack looks up its value in the following priority order:\n>     1.  In `message.groupId`\n>     2.  In `message.traits.groupId`\n> *   If you map any other field as a group key, RudderStack looks up its value in `message.traits.groupKey`.\n> *   You can specify multiple values for a group key and send them in an array in the `group` event payload.\n\n## Send historic events\n\nMixpanel supports importing historical event data. However, note that the event timestamp should be within the **last 5 years**. Mixpanel rejects any data older than this duration. To send historic events, provide the timestamp in the `timestamp` field of the message. RudderStack will then send the event with the same timestamp to Mixpanel.\n\n## Mixpanel special traits\n\nThe following table lists all properties that RudderStack sends to Mixpanel as special traits:\n\n| RudderStack Properties | Mixpanel Properties |\n| --- | --- |\n| `created` | `$created` |\n| `email` | `$email` |\n| `firstName` | `$first_name` |\n| `lastName` | `$last_name` |\n| `lastSeen` | `$last_seen` |\n| `name` | `$name` |\n| `username` | `$username` |\n| `phone` | `$phone` |\n| `city`/`address.city` | `$city` |\n| `region`/`address.state` | `$region` |\n| `country`/`address.country` | `$country_code` |\n\n## Send UTM parameters to Mixpanel\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> This section is applicable for [`track`](#track), [`page`](#page), and [`screen`](#screen) events.\n\nRudderStack maps the following keys (derived from the event’s `context.campaign` object) to the Mixpanel standard UTM parameters:\n\n| RudderStack property | Mixpanel UTM parameter |\n| --- | --- |\n| `name` | `utm_campaign` |\n| `source` | `utm_source` |\n| `medium` | `utm_medium` |\n| `content` | `utm_content` |\n| `term` | `utm_term` |\n\nAny contextual fields apart from the ones mentioned above are sent as `utm_{key}` to Mixpanel. An example is shown below:\n\n```\n{\n  \"context\": {\n    \"campaign\": {\n      \"name\": \"test_name\",\n      \"source\": \"test_source\",\n      \"medium\": \"test_mediun\",\n      \"content\": \"test_content\",\n      \"term\": \"test_term\",\n      \"keyword\": \"test_keyword\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n```\nutm_campaign\nutm_source\nutm_medium\nutm_content\nutm_term\nutm_keyword\n```\n\nIn the above example, RudderStack sends `utm_keyword` as a custom UTM parameter to Mixpanel.\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### Can I pass `null` and empty values for the properties?\n\nYes, RudderStack supports passing empty or `null` values for the properties sent to Mixpanel.\n\nMixpanel imposes certain limitations on its API requests such as:\n\n*   Any `GET` request URL above 19K characters (around 19 KB+) is blocked.\n*   The header size more than 15KB is not allowed.\n*   The body of the request more than 20MB is not allowed.\n*   Each event can have up to 255 event properties.\n\nIf your requests are larger than the above-mentioned limits, you will get a ‘Request Header Fields Too Large’ error.\n\nSee [Mixpanel’s Community FAQ](https://community.mixpanel.com/sending-data-to-mixpanel-11/why-am-i-getting-413-errors-when-using-the-http-api-4659) for more information.\n\nQuestions?

For more information, see [Mixpanel User Profiles documentation](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/en-us/articles/14377628688788#user-profiles).\n\nA sample `identify` call is as shown:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify(\"12345\", {\n  firstname: \"Alex\",\n  city: \"New Orleans\",\n  country: \"USA\",\n  phone: \"8005550100\",\n  email: \"alex@example.com\"\n})\n```\n\n### Setting traits as People Properties and Super Properties\n\nIf **Use Mixpanel People** option is toggled on in the dashboard, you can set the `identify` traits as both **Super Properties** and **People Properties**. To do so, turn on the **Automatically set all Traits as Super Properties and People Properties** option in the dashboard settings.\n\nYou can also choose to filter your reports by both People Properties and Super Properties. This gives you better control over what traits you can set as a Super Property or People Property. To do this:\n\n1.  Disable the **Automatically set all Traits as Super Properties and People Properties** option in the dashboard.\n2.  Add the traits that you want to send to Mixpanel as Super Properties or People Properties in the **Properties to send as Super Properties** and **Traits to set as People Properties** fields respectively:\n\n[![](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/mixpanel-super-people.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/mixpanel-super-people.webp)\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack sends all Mixpanel [special traits](#mixpanel-special-traits) as People Properties. Hence, you can only add the properties that are not in this list.\n\n### Properties to set only once\n\nRudderStack lets you set the `identify` traits as Mixpanel properties whose values you do not want to change at the user profile level, that is, Mixpanel will not overwrite the existing property values. See [Mixpanel documentation](https://developer.mixpanel.com/reference/profile-set-property-once/) for more information on this feature.\n\nTo use this feature:\n\n1.  Enable the **Use Mixpanel People** option in the dashboard.\n2.  Add the traits in the **Properties to set only once** setting.\n\n[![](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/mixpanel-properties-set-once.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/mixpanel-properties-set-once.webp)\n\nRudderStack expects the traits specified in the above field to be present in the `context.traits` object within the `identify` event.\n\nFor example, if your `identify` event contains the following and you specify `address.city` in the **Properties to set only once** field:\n\n```\n\"traits\": {\n  \"address\": {\n    \"city\": \"London\"\n  }\n}\n\n...\n\n\"context\": {\n  \"traits\": {\n    \"address\": {\n      \"city\": \"Berlin\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThen, RudderStack maps `city` as `Berlin`.\n\n### Reserved Mixpanel properties\n\nMixpanel has some reserved properties:\n\n*   `$first_name`\n*   `$last_name`\n*   `$name`\n*   `$username`\n*   `$created`\n*   `$email`\n*   `$phone`\n*   `$avatar`\n*   `$city`\n*   `$country_code`\n*   `$region`\n*   `$unsubscribed`\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> You should not create custom properties that begin with a `$` sign.\n\n### Mixpanel People\n\nRudderStack does not send data to Mixpanel People by default, as it usually requires you to upgrade your Mixpanel account. If you want to use this feature, you can turn on the **Use Mixpanel People** option in the RudderStack dashboard.\n\nYou can identify the user traits without the `userId` if you wish to add the people properties in Mixpanel before knowing the `userId`. To do so, see the following snippet:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify({\n  email: 'alex@example.com',\n  name: 'Alex Keener'\n})\n```\n\n## Track\n\nTo track user events, use the [`track`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/track/) method with the event name and the associated properties.\n\nWhen you select **Simplified ID Merge** in the **Identity Merge** dashboard setting, RudderStack sets the event’s `userId` and `anonymousId` using Mixpanel’s [Simplified ID Merge API](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/en-us/articles/14377628688788) so that the two identifiers are glued to a single user profile.\n\nA sample `track` call is as shown:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"track event\", {\n    test_prop1: 50,\n    test_prop2: \"prop_value\"\n});\n```\n\n### Track revenue\n\nMixpanel lets you track revenue events. If you send `revenue` as a property in your `track` event, RudderStack tracks it as a revenue event.\n\nRevenue tracking is done with a `distinct_id` (`userId` that you provide in your `identify` call; if `userId` is not present then it will be associated with an `anonymousId`.)\n\nA sample revenue `track` call is as shown:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"Purchase\", {\n  revenue: 100,\n  currency: \"USD\"\n});\n```\n\n### Track charge\n\nIf **Use Mixpanel People** setting is toggled on in your RudderStack dashboard and you include `revenue` as an event property, RudderStack will track a charge for the current user.\n\n## Page\n\nRudderStack passes all page properties that you provide via the [`page`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/page/) call to Mixpanel, along with the other default properties. It sets the event name as **Page** for a `page` call and **Screen** for a [`screen`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/screen/) call.\n\nWhen you select **Simplified ID Merge** in the **Identity Merge** dashboard setting, RudderStack sets the event’s `userId` and `anonymousId` using Mixpanel’s [Simplified ID Merge API](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/en-us/articles/14377628688788) so that the two identifiers are glued to a single user profile.\n\nA sample `page` call is shown below:\n\n### Page web device mode settings\n\nRudderStack will send 1 event to Mixpanel per `page` call.\n\nFor device mode, RudderStack offers the following three options for `page` calls:\n\n*   **Track All Pages with a Consolidated Event Name**: This setting is on by default. RudderStack sends all `page` and `screen` calls with the name `Loaded a Page` with the corresponding properties of the call. This lets you leverage Mixpanel’s reporting capabilities for page/screen analytics in the best possible way.\n*   **Track Categorized Pages to Mixpanel**: RudderStack tracks the categorized pages to Mixpanel. If you turn on this setting in the dashboard, RudderStack sends a `Viewed [<category>] Page` event to Mixpanel. If the page name is also present in the event, then RudderStack sends a `Viewed [<category> <page_name>] Page` event.\n*   **Track Named Pages to Mixpanel**: RudderStack also tracks the named pages to Mixpanel. If you turn on this setting in the dashboard, RudderStack will send a `Viewed [page_name] Page` event. Note that this option has the least precedence and comes to effect only if the above two options are disabled in the RudderStack dashboard.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack gives the highest precedence to the **Track All Pages with a Consolidated Event Name** option even if **Track Categorized Pages to Mixpanel** and **Track Named Pages to Mixpanel** are turned on in the dashboard.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack expects atleast one of the three options listed above to be toggled on for sending the `page` events to Mixpanel using device mode.\n\n## Alias\n\nThe [`alias`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/alias/) call lets you associate multiple identities of a known user.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> The `alias` call is deprecated with the **Simplified ID Merge** dashboard setting.\n\nA sample `alias` call is as shown:\n\n```\nanalytics.alias('userId', `previousId`);\n```\n\n## Group\n\nThe [`group`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/group/) call lets you link an identified user with a group such as a company, organization, or an account, and record any traits associated with that group, for example, company name, number of employees, etc. For more information on how the `group` call works in Mixpanel, see Mixpanel’s [Group Analytics](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/en-us/articles/360025333632-Group-Analytics) documentation.\n\nRudderStack lets you record the custom traits associated with a user group and send this information to Mixpanel.\n\nA sample `group` call is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.group(\n  \"sample_group_id\", {\n    name: \"Tech group\",\n    industry: \"Technology\",\n    employees: 100,\n  }\n);\n```\n\n### Group key\n\nYou can create group keys in the [Mixpanel project settings](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/en-us/articles/360025333632-Group-Analytics#implementation), which act as the group identifiers in Mixpanel. To successfully send a `group` call to Mixpanel, you must specify **at least** one group key in the **Group Key** RudderStack dashboard setting:\n\n[![Mixpanel group key settings](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/mixpanel-group-key-settings.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/mixpanel-group-key-settings.webp)\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> Note the following points:\n> \n> *   If you map the `groupId` as a group key, RudderStack looks up its value in the following priority order:\n>     1.  In `message.groupId`\n>     2.  In `message.traits.groupId`\n> *   If you map any other field as a group key, RudderStack looks up its value in `message.traits.groupKey`.\n> *   You can specify multiple values for a group key and send them in an array in the `group` event payload.\n\n## Send historic events\n\nMixpanel supports importing historical event data. However, note that the event timestamp should be within the **last 5 years**. Mixpanel rejects any data older than this duration. To send historic events, provide the timestamp in the `timestamp` field of the message. RudderStack will then send the event with the same timestamp to Mixpanel.\n\n## Mixpanel special traits\n\nThe following table lists all properties that RudderStack sends to Mixpanel as special traits:\n\n| RudderStack Properties | Mixpanel Properties |\n| --- | --- |\n| `created` | `$created` |\n| `email` | `$email` |\n| `firstName` | `$first_name` |\n| `lastName` | `$last_name` |\n| `lastSeen` | `$last_seen` |\n| `name` | `$name` |\n| `username` | `$username` |\n| `phone` | `$phone` |\n| `city`/`address.city` | `$city` |\n| `region`/`address.state` | `$region` |\n| `country`/`address.country` | `$country_code` |\n\n## Increment events in Mixpanel People\n\nTo increment event counts in Mixpanel People, you can add the events in the **Events to increment in People** field.\n\nFor each event name added, RudderStack automatically calls Mixpanel and sets a user trait as `Last + <event_name>`. For example, if you add `Logged In` to the list of increment events, RudderStack will increment a user trait called `Logged In` and set a trait called `Last Logged In` with the current date and time.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> Increment works for known users only. If you make a `track` call, you must identify your user first.\n\n## Increment properties in Mixpanel People\n\nTo increment properties in Mixpanel People, you can add them in the **Properties to Increment in People** field. RudderStack will call Mixpanel’s increment when you attach a number to the specified property. For example, `'items purchased': 5`.\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### Can I pass `null` and empty values for the properties?\n\nYes, RudderStack supports passing empty or `null` values for the properties sent to Mixpanel.\n\nQuestions?

It allows you to specify which company performed that specific event.\n\nA sample `group` call is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.group(\"23Np893Z6\", {\n  name: \"ABC company\",\n  employees: 100,\n  Industry: \"Video game publisher\",\n  Founded: 1979\n});\n```\n\n#### **Property mapping**\n\nThe following table lists the property mappings between RudderStack and June for the `group` call:\n\n| RudderStack property | Data type | June property |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `userId`  <br>`traits.userId`  <br>`traits.id`  <br>`context.traits.userId`  <br>`context.traits.id`  <br><br>*   Required for creating a company.<br>*   Optional for updating the company details. | String | `userId` |\n| `originalTimestamp`  <br>`timestamp`  <br>Required | Timestamp in ISO 8601 format  <br>(`yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.SSSZ`) | `timestamp` |\n| `groupId`  <br>`traits.groupId`  <br>Required | String | `groupId` |\n| `anonymousId` | String | `anonymousId` |\n| `traits`  <br>`context.traits` | Object | `traits` |\n| `context` | Object | `context` |\n\n## Page\n\nYou can use the [`page`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/page/) call to record and send page views to June.\n\nA sample `page` event:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.page(\"Home\");\n```\n\n#### **Property mapping**\n\n| RudderStack property | Data type | June property |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `properties`  <br>Required | Object | `properties` |\n| `userId`  <br>`traits.userId`  <br>`traits.id`  <br>`context.traits.userId`  <br>`context.traits.id` | String | `userId` |\n| `timestamp`  <br>`originalTimestamp` | Timestamp in ISO 8601 format  <br>(`yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.SSSZ`) | `timestamp` |\n| `anonymousId` | String | `anonymousId` |\n| `groupId` | String | `context.groupId` |\n| `context` | Object | `context` |\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### Can I make an `identify` or `track` call using `anonymousId`?\n\nNo, you cannot. June does not stitch identities together or support merging anonymous users. It is best used to measure user activation and retention when the user is logged in.\n\n#### My user is created as `Unknown` in June dashboard. What might be the reason?\n\nJune categorizes a user as `Unknown` if the `firstName`, `lastName`, `name`, `username`, or `email` is not present in the `traits` object of the `identify` call.\n\nQuestions?

    "markdown": "# LinkedIn Insight Tag | RudderStack Docs\n\nSend your event data from RudderStack to LinkedIn Insight Tag.\n\n* * *\n\n*     5 minute read  \n    \n\nThe [LinkedIn Insight Tag](https://business.linkedin.com/marketing-solutions/insight-tag) is a JavaScript code for your website that lets you track your conversions and retarget your website visitors and customers who interact with your ads. You can use the resulting insights to learn more about your customers and optimize your marketing campaigns.\n\nRudderStack supports integration with the LinkedIn Insight Tag where you can seamlessly send your event data to LinkedIn.\n\n## Getting started\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> If you are already using LinkedIn Insight Tag on your website, removing it is highly recommended. This is because the RudderStack SDK automatically loads the Insight Tag tracking code and it may cause a conflict with the existing installation. For more information on the integration’s workflow, refer to the [FAQ](#faq) section below.\n\nRudderStack supports sending event data to LinkedIn Insight Tag via the following [connection modes](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/):\n\n| Connection Mode | Web | Mobile | Server |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Device mode | Supported | \\-  | \\-  |\n| Cloud mode | \\-  | \\-  | \\-  |\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> In a web device mode integration, that is, using [JavaScript SDK](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/) as a source, the LinkedIn Insight Tag native SDK is loaded from `https://snap.licdn.com/` domain. Based on your website’s content security policy, you might need to [allowlist this domain](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/load-js-sdk/#allowlist-destination-domain) to load the LinkedIn Insight Tag SDK successfully.\n\nOnce you have confirmed that the source platform supports sending events to LinkedIn Insight Tag, follow these steps:\n\n1.  From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add a source. Then, from the list of destinations, select **LinkedIn Insight Tag**.\n2.  Assign a name to the destination and click **Continue**.\n\n### Connection settings\n\nTo successfully configure LinkedIn Insight Tag as a destination, you will need to configure the following settings:\n\n[![LinkedIn Insight Tag connection settings](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/insight-tag-connection-settings.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/insight-tag-connection-settings.webp)\n\n*   **Partner ID**: Enter your LinkedIn partner ID.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> For more information on getting your LinkedIn partner ID, refer to the [FAQ](#where-can-i-find-my-linkedin-partner-id) section below.\n\n*   **Event Conversion IDs**: Enter the event name you want the Insight Tag to track and the corresponding conversion ID.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> The event names are case-sensitive. For example, RudderStack accepts `Order Completed`, `Order completed`, and `order completed` as three different events.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> For more information on getting the conversion ID, refer to the [Tracking event-specific conversions](#tracking-event-specific-conversions) section below.\n\n*   **Client-side Events Filtering**: This setting lets you specify which events should be blocked or allowed to flow through to the LinkedIn Insight Tag.\n\n*   **Use device mode to send events**: As this is a [web device mode](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#device-mode)\\-only destination, this setting is enabled by default and cannot be disabled.\n*   **OneTrust Cookie Categories**: This setting lets you associate [OneTrust](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/data-governance/consent-management/onetrust/javascript/) cookie consent groups to the LinkedIn Insight Tag destination.\n\n## Tracking page loads\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> For more information on the tracking methods supported by the Insight Tag, refer to the [LinkedIn support page](https://www.linkedin.com/help/lms/answer/a425606?trk=hc-articlePage-peopleAlsoViewed).\n\nIn this method, the Insight Tag automatically loads and tracks the conversions when users visit any pages on your website. Upon loading successfully, you can view the conversion status in your [Campaign Manager](https://www.linkedin.com/campaignmanager/accounts) dashboard:\n\n[![LinkedIn Insight campaign manager dashboard](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/insight-tag-campaign-manager.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/insight-tag-campaign-manager.webp)\n\n## Tracking event-specific conversions\n\nTo track event-specific conversions, you need to first set up an Online Tracking conversion and define an event-specific conversion tracking. To do so, follow these steps:\n\n1.  Sign into your [LinkedIn Campaign Manager](https://www.linkedin.com/campaignmanager/accounts).\n2.  Click your account name and go to **Analyze** > **Conversion Tracking**.\n3.  Click the **Create Conversion** button and select **Online Conversion**.\n\n[![LinkedIn Insight online conversion option](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/insight-tag-online-conversion.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/insight-tag-online-conversion.webp)\n\n4.  Name your conversion and enter the relevant settings. For more information, refer to this [LinkedIn support page](https://www.linkedin.com/help/lms/answer/a425606/set-up-linkedin-conversion-tracking?lang=en).\n5.  Click **Next step** and select the campaign to track your conversion.\n6.  Under **Manually set up conversions**, go to **Define your conversion tracking method** and select **Event-specific**.\n7.  Click **Copy code**. You will find the conversion ID listed here:\n\n[![LinkedIn Insight online conversion ID](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/insight-tag-conversion-id.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/insight-tag-conversion-id.webp)\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> You will need to install this generated code in your website that automatically loads and tracks conversions for the specified event.\n\n8.  Finally, specify the **Event Name** for which the Insight Tag automatically loads this snippet and the corresponding conversion ID in the **Event Conversion IDs** dashboard setting.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> The event names are case-sensitive.\n\n#### Use-case\n\nSuppose you add the following event name-conversion ID mapping in the RudderStack dashboard:\n\n[![LinkedIn Insight event tracking use-case](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/insight-tag-usecase.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/insight-tag-usecase.webp)\n\nWhen you call the `Product Added` event, the LinkedIn Insight Tag automatically loads the snippet with the mapped conversion ID and tracks the conversion event.\n\nA sample `Product Added` event is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"Product Added\", {\n  numberOfRatings: \"12\",\n  name: \"item 1\",\n});\n```\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack discards any `track` event that is not specified in the **Event Conversion IDs** dashboard setting.\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### How does this integration work?\n\nThe RudderStack-LinkedIn Insight Tag integration workflow is explained below:\n\n1.  Configure **LinkedIn Insight Tag** as a destination in the [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/).\n2.  Install the [RudderStack JavaScript SDK](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/quickstart/#step-1-install-javascript-sdk) on your website.\n3.  The JavaScript SDK automatically loads the Insight Tag tracking code.\n4.  The Insight Tag starts tracking the user activities on your website.\n\n#### What information can I track using the LinkedIn Insight Tag?\n\nThe LinkedIn Insight Tag lets you collect the data related to your users’ website visits, including the URL, IP address, referrer, device and browser characteristics, and timestamp.\n\n#### Where can I find my LinkedIn partner ID?\n\nTo get the Partner ID, open the Insight Tag and get the value corresponding to the `_linkedin_partner_id` parameter:\n\n[![LinkedIn Insight Tag partner ID](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/insight-tag-partner-id.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/insight-tag-partner-id.webp)\n\nAlternatively, you can follow the steps in this [LinkedIn support page](https://www.linkedin.com/help/lms/answer/a417869/access-your-linkedin-partner-id?lang=en) to access your LinkedIn partner ID.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> Each LinkedIn Insight Tag has a unique Partner ID. If the Partner ID of the tag on your website does not match the Partner ID in your account, the Insight Tag will be unable to collect the page loads and event-specific conversions.\n\n### How can I verify if the event-specific conversions are tracked successfully?\n\nOnce you configure the **Event Conversion IDs** setting in the RudderStack dashboard, the LinkedIn Insight Tag automatically loads the code snippet and tracks the conversions for the specified events.\n\nIf the script has loaded correctly, it shows the label **Conversion status: Active** against the events in your dashboard:\n\n[![LinkedIn Insight conversion status](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/insight-tag-conversion-status.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/insight-tag-conversion-status.webp)\n\nIn case the script has not loaded correctly, you will see the **Conversion Status** as **Unverified**, **No recent activity**, or **Inactive**.\n\n#### Will this integration slow my website down?\n\nThe RudderStack SDK loads asynchronously with your website. When loading the LinkedIn Insight Tag tracking snippet, it will not slow down your website’s performance at all.\n\nQuestions?

It allows you to specify which company performed that specific event. For more information, refer to the [June documentation](https://www.june.so/docs/tracking/web/browser).\n\nA sample `group` call is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.group(\"23Np893Z6\", {\n  name: \"ABC company\",\n  employees: 100,\n  Industry: \"Video game publisher\",\n  Founded: 1979\n});\n```\n\n### Property mappings\n\nThe following table lists the property mappings between RudderStack and June for the `group` call:\n\n| RudderStack property | June property | Data type | Presence |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `groupId`/`traits.groupId` | `groupId` | String | Required |\n| `traits` | `traits` | Object | Optional |\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### Can I make an `identify` or `track` call using `anonymousId`?\n\nNo, you can’t. June does not stitch identities together or support merging anonymous users. Rather, it is best used to measure user activation and retention when the user is logged in.\n\n#### My user is created as `Unknown` in June dashboard.

You can then see the events under the **Test** section of your MoEngage app.\n*   **OneTrust Cookie Categories**: This setting lets you associate [OneTrust](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/data-governance/consent-management/onetrust/javascript/) cookie consent groups to MoEngage.\n\n## Adding device mode integration\n\nOnce you add MoEngage as a destination in the [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), follow these steps to add it to your project depending on your integration platform:\n\n1.  Go to your `Podfile` and add the `Rudder-Moengage` extension.\n\n2.  After adding the dependency followed by `pod install`, add the imports to your `AppDelegate.m` file:\n\n```\n#import \"RudderMoengageFactory.h\"\n```\n\n3.  Finally, change the initialization of your `RudderClient`:\n\n```\nRudderConfigBuilder *builder = [[RudderConfigBuilder alloc] init];\n[builder withDataPlaneUrl:DATA_PLANE_URL];\n[builder withFactory:[RudderMoengageFactory instance]];\n[RudderClient getInstance:WRITE_KEY config:[builder build]];\n```\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> This device mode integration is supported for MoEngage v6.1.0 and above.\n\n1.  Install `RudderMoEngage` (available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/)) by adding the following line to your `Podfile`:\n\n```\npod 'RudderMoEngage', '~> 1.0.0'\n```\n\n2.  Run the `pod install` command.\n3.  Import the SDK depending on your preferred platform:\n\n4.  Add the imports to your `AppDelegate` file under the `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` method:\n\n```\nlet config: RSConfig = RSConfig(writeKey: WRITE_KEY)\n            .dataPlaneURL(DATA_PLANE_URL)\n\nRSClient.sharedInstance().configure(with: config)\nRSClient.sharedInstance().addDestination(RudderMoEngageDestination())\n```\n\n```\nRSConfig *config = [[RSConfig alloc] initWithWriteKey:WRITE_KEY];\n[config dataPlaneURL:DATA_PLANE_URL];\n\n[[RSClient sharedInstance] configureWith:config];\n[[RSClient sharedInstance] addDestination:[[RudderMoEngageDestination alloc] init]];\n```\n\n1.  Open your `app/build.gradle` (Module: app) file and add the following lines:\n\n```\nrepositories {\n    mavenCentral()\n}\n```\n\n2.  Add the following dependencies:\n\n```\n// RudderStack Android and MoEngage SDKs\nimplementation 'com.rudderstack.android.sdk:core:[1.0,2.0)'\nimplementation 'com.rudderstack.android.integration:moengage:2.0.0'\n\n// For MoEngage core SDK initialisation\nimplementation(\"com.moengage:moe-android-sdk:12.5.04\")\n\n// Firebase messaging dependency\nimplementation 'com.google.firebase:firebase-messaging:23.1.1'\n\n// If you don't have Gson included already\nimplementation 'com.google.code.gson:gson:2.8.9'\n```\n\n3.  After `buildscript`, add the below plugin:\n\n```\n// For Push Notification\napply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'\n```\n\n4.  Open your `build.gradle` (Module: Project) file and add the following in the `buildscript` dependencies:\n\n```\n// For Push Notification\nbuildscript {\n    dependencies {\n        classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:4.3.14'\n    }\n}\n```\n\n5.  Initialize the RudderStack SDK in the `Application` class’ `onCreate()` method:\n\n```\n// initializing Rudder SDK\nval rudderClient = RudderClient.getInstance(\n    this,\n    WRITE_KEY,\n    RudderConfig.Builder()\n        .withDataPlaneUrl(DATA_PLANE_URL)\n        .withFactory(MoengageIntegrationFactory.FACTORY)\n        .build()\n)\n```\n\n6.  Initialize the MoEngage SDK in the `Application` class’ `onCreate()` method:\n\n```\n// initializing MoEngage SDK and \"XXXXXXXXXXX\" is the APP ID from the dashboard.\nval moEngage =\n    MoEngage.Builder(this, \"XXXXXXXXXXX\")\n        .configureLogs(LogConfig(LogLevel.VERBOSE, false))\n        .build()\n\nMoEngage.initialiseDefaultInstance(moEngage)\n```\n\n1.  Add the RudderStack-MoEngage module to your app by running the following command:\n\n```\nnpm install @rudderstack/rudder-integration-moengage-react-native\n// OR //\nyarn add @rudderstack/rudder-integration-moengage-react-native\n```\n\n2.  Import the above module and add it to your SDK initialization:\n\n```\nimport rudderClient from \"@rudderstack/rudder-sdk-react-native\"\nimport moengage from \"@rudderstack/rudder-integration-moengage-react-native\"\nconst config = {\n  dataPlaneUrl: <data_plane_url>,\n  trackAppLifecycleEvents: true,\n  withFactories: [moengage],\n}\nrudderClient.setup( <write_key> , config)\n```\n\n3.  Add the following dependencies in the `android/app/build.gradle` (Module: app) file in the Android folder of your React Native project:\n\n```\nimplementation 'com.rudderstack.android.sdk:core:1.+'\nimplementation 'com.rudderstack.android.integration:moengage:1.0.0'\nimplementation 'com.moengage:moe-android-sdk:10.5.00'\n\n//jet pack library required by moengage\nimplementation 'androidx.core:core-ktx:1.3.2'\nimplementation 'androidx.appcompat:appcompat:1.2.0'\nimplementation 'androidx.lifecycle:lifecycle-process:2.2.0'\n\n//firebase messaging dependency\nimplementation 'com.google.firebase:firebase-messaging:21.0.0'\n\n// if you don't have Gson included already\nimplementation 'com.google.code.gson:gson:2.8.6'\n```\n\n4.  In the `android/build.gradle` (Module: Project) file, add the following lines:\n\n```\nrepositories {\n  mavenCentral()\n}\n```\n\n5.  Add the following in the `buildscript` dependencies in `android/build.gradle` (Module: Project) file:\n\n```\n// For Push Notification\nbuildscript {\n  dependencies {\n    classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:4.3.4'\n  }\n}\n```\n\n5.  Add the following plugin at the top of `android/app/build.gradle` (Module: app):\n\n```\n// For Push Notification\napply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'\n```\n\n6.  Initialize the MoEngage SDK in the `Application` class’ `onCreate()` method:\n\n```\n// MoEngage SDK initialisation: Replace \"xxxxxxx\" with your APP ID.\nMoEngage moEngage = new MoEngage\n  .Builder(MainActivity.this.getApplication(), \"xxxxxxx\")\n  .enableLogs(LogLevel.VERBOSE)\n  .build();\nMoEngage.initialise(moEngage);\n```\n\n## Identify\n\nYou can use the [`identify`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/identify/) API to identify a user in MoEngage. You can also create a new user property or update existing user properties using the `identify` call.\n\nMoEngage needs a unique identifier to identify a user. So, you must provide a `userId` in your `identify` call that RudderStack passes as the MoEngage `customer_id` . If `userId` is absent, RudderStack sends the `anonymousId` field instead.\n\nA sample identify call is as shown:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify(\"1hKOmRA4GRlm\", {\n  name: \"Alex Keener\",\n  first_name: \"Alex\",\n  last_name: \"Keener\",\n  email: \"alex@example.com\",\n  createdAt: \"Thu Mar 24 2020 17:46:45 GMT+0000 (UTC)\",\n})\n```\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack uses the `identify` call to log the user into MoEngage in the device mode.\n\n### Identifying a device in MoEngage\n\nYou can identify a device in MoEngage using the `identify` call to create or update your device properties.\n\nA sample call for identifying device is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify(\"name123\", {\n  context: {\n    device: {\n      id: \"7ase32188a4dab669f\",\n      manufacturer: \"Apple\",\n      model: \"IOS SDK built for x86\",\n      name: \"generic_x86\",\n      token: \"devtoken\",\n      type: \"ios\",\n    },\n  },\n})\n```\n\n### MoEngage reserved properties\n\nMoEngage has reserved the following property names:\n\n*   `name`\n*   `first_name`\n*   `last_name`\n*   `email`\n*   `age`\n*   `gender`\n*   `mobile`\n*   `transactions`\n*   `revenue`\n*   `moe_unsubscribe`\n\nAlso, MoEngage lets you create custom properties but you must not create properties with the names `id`, `_id`, or `\"\"` .\n\n## Track\n\nRudderStack’s [`track`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/track/) API lets you track user events and their associated properties.\n\nA sample `track` call is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"Order Completed\", {\n  checkout_id: \"C324532\",\n  order_id: \"T1230\",\n  value: 15.98,\n  revenue: 16.98,\n  shipping: 3.0,\n  coupon: \"FY21\",\n  currency: \"INR\",\n  products: [\n    {\n      product_id: \"product-mixedfruit-jam\",\n      sku: \"sku-1\",\n      category: \"Food\",\n      name: \"Food/Drink\",\n      brand: \"Sample\",\n      variant: \"None\",\n      price: 10.0,\n      quantity: 2,\n      currency: \"INR\",\n      position: 1,\n      value: 6.0,\n      typeOfProduct: \"Food\",\n      url: \"https://www.example.com/product/bacon-jam\",\n      image_url: \"https://www.example.com/product/bacon-jam.jpg\",\n    },\n  ],\n})\n```\n\n## Alias\n\nYou can use the [`alias`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/alias/) API to [merge](https://developers.moengage.com/hc/en-us/articles/10990676421908-User-Merge) two different user profiles in MoEngage.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> MoEngage’s user merging functionality is a closed feature and is not available by default. To enable it for your account, contact your Customer Success Manager or drop a mail to their [support team](mailto:support@moengage.com).\n\nA sample `alias` call made using the different RudderStack SDKs is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.alias(\"12345\", \"1hKOmRA4GRlm\")\n```\n\n```\n[[RSClient sharedInstance]  alias:@\"newId\"];\n```\n\n```\nrudderClient.alias(\"newId\")\n```\n\n### Supported mappings\n\nRudderStack maps the following `alias` properties to the corresponding MoEngage properties:\n\n| RudderStack property | MoEngage property | Data type |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `message.userId`  <br>Required | `merged_user` | String |\n| `message.previousId`  <br>Required | `retained_user` | String |\n\n## Reset\n\nRudderStack’s `reset` API resets the previously identified user and the related information.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> The `reset` API is applicable only for device mode connections.\n\nRefer to the following snippets to implement the `reset` method in your mobile project:\n\n```\n[[RSClient sharedInstance] reset];\n```\n\n## Supported mappings\n\nRudderStack maps the following properties to the MoEngage properties before sending them using MoEngage’s HTTP API.\n\n| RudderStack property | MoEngage property |\n| --- | --- |\n| `pushPreference` | `push_preference` |\n| `active` | `active` |\n| `userId` | `customer_id` |\n| `name` | `name` |\n| `firstname`  <br>`first_name`  <br>`firstName` | `first_name` |\n| `lastname`  <br>`last_name`  <br>`lastName` | `last_name` |\n| `email` | `email` |\n| `age` | `age` |\n| `gender` | `gender` |\n| `mobile` | `mobile` |\n| `source` | `source` |\n| `createdAt` | `created_time` |\n| `last_seen`  <br>`lastSeen` | `last_seen` |\n| `transactions` | `transactions` |\n| `revenue` | `revenue` |\n| `moe_unsubscribe`  <br>`moeUnsubscribe` | `moe_unsubscribe` |\n| `event` | `action` |\n| `properties` | `attributes` |\n\n## Configuring push notifications\n\nDepending on your platform, follow these steps to configure MoEngage push notifications in your project:\n\n1.  Create an APNS certificate and convert it to a `.pem` file.\n2.  Upload this `.pem` file in your MoEngage dashboard.\n3.  In the target app, turn on **App Groups** and enable one of the app group IDs. In case if you don’t have an app group ID, then create one. The name of your app group should be `group.{bundle id}.MoEngage`.\n4.  Enable **Background mode** by navigating to **Targets** > **Your App** > **Signing & Capabilities** > **Select Background Modes**. Then, check **Remote notifications**.\n5.  Enable push notification capabilities in your app.\n6.  Before initializing, add `[MoEngage setAppGroupID:<your app group id>];`\n7.  To keep the notifications even after the app launch, add the line `[MoEngage sharedInstance].disableBadgeReset = true;`\n\nFor more information on implementing push notifications in MoEngage, see the [MoEngage documentation](https://developers.moengage.com/hc/en-us/articles/4403943988756-Push-Notifications).\n\n**In-App messaging**\n\nIn-app messaging is a type of mobile messaging where the notification is displayed within the app. Some examples include popups, yes/no prompts, and more. To implement this feature, follow MoEngage’s [InApp NATIV guide](https://developers.moengage.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404155127828-In-App-Nativ).\n\n1.  Create an APNS certificate and convert it to a `.pem` file.\n2.  Upload this `.pem` file in your MoEngage dashboard.\n3.  Enable **Background mode** by navigating to **Targets** > **Your App** > **Signing & Capabilities** > **Select Background Modes**. Then, check **Remote notifications**.\n4.  Then, in your `plist` file, add the `MoEngageAppDelegateProxyEnabled` key and set it to `false` to disable swizzling.\n5.  Finally, implement the relevant methods in your `AppDelegate` file by referring to [Supporting push notifications for device mode destinations](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-ios-sdk/ios-v2/#supporting-push-notifications-for-device-mode-destinations).\n6.  To keep the push notifications even after app launch, call the below method:\n\n```\nMoEngage.sharedInstance().setDisableBadgeReset(true)\n```\n\n```\n[[MoEngage sharedInstance] setDisableBadgeReset:true];\n```\n\nFor more information on implementing push notifications in MoEngage, see the [MoEngage documentation](https://developers.moengage.com/hc/en-us/articles/4403943988756-Push-Notifications).\n\n1.  Copy the Server Key from the FCM console and add it to the MoEngage dashboard. If you’re not sure where to find the server key, refer to this [MoEngage guide](https://developers.moengage.com/hc/en-us/articles/360061216011-Push-Configuration).\n2.  Navigate to the [Settings page](https://app.moengage.com/v3/#/settings/push/mobile) of your MoEngage dashboard and add the server key and package name. **Make sure you add the keys both in the Test and Live environment.**\n3.  Before configuring the MoEngage SDK for receiving push notifications, make you have [configured Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup) in your application.\n4.  Add the Firebase messaging dependency in your application’s `build.gradle` file.\n5.  Add the meta tags to manifest. To show the push notifications, you need to add the notification icons (small and large) along with the app ID to the `MoEngage.Builder`, as shown:\n\n```\nval moEngage =\n    MoEngage.Builder(this, \"XXXXXXXX\")\n        .setNotificationSmallIcon(R.drawable.icon)\n        .setNotificationLargeIcon(R.drawable.ic_launcher)\n        .build()\n\nMoEngage.initialise(moEngage)\n```\n\n**Display notifications**\n\nTo display the notifications, you must ensure the following:\n\n*   Registration for Push, that is, generating a push token.\n*   Receiving the push payload from Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) and displaying the alert on the device.\n\nThese actions are handled by the application or the MoEngage SDK, depending on your preference. Refer to the following sections to configure them.\n\n**Push Registration and Receiving handled by the app**\n\nBy default, the MoEngage SDK attempts to register a push token. If your application is handling the push notifications, you need to opt-out of the SDK’s token registration.\n\n**Opt out of MoEngage Registration**\n\nTo opt-out of MoEngage’s token registration mechanism call the `optOutTokenRegistration()` method in `MoEngage.Builder`, as shown:\n\n```\nval moEngage =\n    MoEngage.Builder(this, \"XXXXXXXX\")\n        .setNotificationSmallIcon(R.drawable.icon)\n        .setNotificationLargeIcon(R.drawable.ic_launcher)\n        .configureFcm(FcmConfig(false))\n        .build()\n\nMoEngage.initialise(moEngage)\n```\n\n**Pass the push token to MoEngage SDK**\n\nThe application would need to pass the push token received from FCM to the MoEngage SDK for MoEngage to send push notifications to the device. Use the following API to pass the push token to the MoEngage SDK:\n\n```\nMoEFireBaseHelper.getInstance().passPushToken(applicationContext, token)\n```\n\nMake sure the token is passed to the MoEngage SDK whenever the push token is refreshed or your app is updated. Passing the token on application update is required to migrate to MoEngage.\n\n**Passing the push payload to the MoEngage SDK**\n\nTo pass the push payload to the MoEngage SDK, call the MoEngage API from `onMessageReceived()` from the Firebase receiver. Before passing the payload to the MoEngage SDK, you should check if the payload is from MoEngage using the helper API provided by the SDK.\n\n```\nif (MoEPushHelper.getInstance().isFromMoEngagePlatform(remoteMessage.data)) {\n  MoEFireBaseHelper.getInstance().passPushPayload(\n    applicationContext,\n    remoteMessage.data\n  )\n} else {\n  // your app's business logic to show notification\n}\n```\n\n**Push registration and receiving handled by SDK**\n\nAdd the following code in your manifest file within the application tag:\n\n```\n<service android:name=\"com.moengage.firebase.MoEFireBaseMessagingService\">\n<intent-filter>\n<action android:name=\"com.google.firebase.MESSAGING_EVENT\"></action>\n</intent-filter>\n</service>\n```\n\nWhen the MoEngage SDK handles push registration it optionally provides a callback to the application whenever a new token is registered or token is refreshed.\n\nAn application can get this callback by implementing `FirebaseEventListener` and registering for a callback in the application class’ `onCreate()` using `MoEFireBaseHelper.getInstance().setEventListener()`.\n\n**In-App messaging**\n\nIn-app messaging is a type of mobile messaging where the notification is displayed within the app. Some examples include popups, yes/no prompts, and more. To implement this follow the MoEngage [InApp NATIV guide](https://developers.moengage.com/hc/en-us/articles/4403652537492-In-App-NATIV).\n\n1.  In your [MoEngage dashboard](http://app.moengage.com/), go to the **Web Push Settings**.\n2.  Under **Web**, fill in the required details.\n3.  For HTTPS Web Push to work, you need to host two files in the root directory of your web server.\n4.  After clicking **SAVE**, download the `serviceworker.js` file under the **Web Push Settings**.\n5.  If you already have your own `serviceworker.js`, add it as shown:\n\n```\nimportScripts(\n  \"https://cdn.moengage.com/webpush/releases/serviceworker_cdn.min.latest.js\"\n)\n```\n\n6.  Select a sub-domain. For more details, follow the [MoEngage guidelines](https://developers.moengage.com/hc/en-us/articles/360062005132-Web-Push-Overview).\n\n1.  Open the `android` folder of your React Native app and follow all steps listed in the `Android` tab in this section.\n2.  Open the `ios` folder of your React Native app and follow all steps listed in the `iOS` tab in this section.\n\n## Timezone offset for cloud mode\n\n### Track\n\nMoEngage allows sending the [time at which the event occurred](https://developers.moengage.com/hc/en-us/articles/4413174104852-Event-#request-body-fields-0-2) and calculates the user local time by taking two parameters - `current_time` and `user_timezone_offset`. `current_time` is the UTC time at which the event occurred and `user_timezone_offset` is the time difference (in seconds) between the **user local time and UTC**.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Note the following:\n> \n> *   RudderStack maps the `current_time` to `timestamp` or `originalTimestamp` from the event payload. Hence, you must pass these values in UTC.\n> *   RudderStack maps `user_timezone_offset` to `timezone` present in the `context` object of the event’s payload. You must pass this value as a string `tz`.\n> *   The RudderStack mobile SDKs automatically populate the `timezone` field. However, for the other sources like server-side SDKs or HTTP API, you must explicitly set the `timezone` field in every request.\n\nA sample `track` payload is shown below:\n\n```\n{\n  \"type\": \"track\",\n  \"event\": \"Email Replied\",\n  \"sentAt\": \"2020-12-02T11:30:33.262Z\",\n  \"context\": {\n    \"library\": {\n      \"name\": \"analytics-node\",\n      \"version\": \"0.0.3\"\n    },\n    \"timezone\": \"Asia/Kolkata\"\n  },\n  \"rudderId\": \"87a40cf3-f6d8-4675-bc01-7854ab4486ec\",\n  \"_metadata\": {\n    \"nodeVersion\": \"10.22.0\"\n  },\n  \"messageId\": \"node-7519b5f2fcacca521c7a9e8ddb9fc09c-c273004b-6968-422d-a511-440b6db24403\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"details\": \"list of details\"\n  },\n  \"anonymousId\": \"anony11111111111\",\n  \"originalTimestamp\": \"2020-12-02T11:30:33.259Z\"\n}\n```\n\n### Identify\n\nMoEngage accepts the user creation time for its [User](https://developers.moengage.com/hc/en-us/articles/4413167462804) endpoint. This is reflected as `first_seen` in the MoEngage dashboard.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack sets the `created_time` field in MoEngage from the `createdAt` field present in the event payload. This value should be in the **ISO 8601** format. If the value is absent or present in an improper format, MoEngage assigns the value automatically.\n\nA sample `identify` payload is shown below:\n\n```\n{\n  \"type\": \"identify\",\n  \"sentAt\": \"2020-12-02T13:04:05.953Z\",\n  \"traits\": {\n    \"city\": \"Bangalore\",\n    \"name\": \"lolo\",\n    \"email\": \"lolo@website.com\",\n    \"country\": \"India\",\n    \"createdAt\": \"2020-12-02T12:29:53.872Z\"\n  },\n  \"userId\": \"111its111\",\n  \"context\": {\n    \"traits\": {\n      \"city\": \"Bangalore\",\n      \"name\": \"lolo\",\n      \"email\": \"lolo@website.com\",\n      \"country\": \"India\",\n      \"createdAt\": \"2020-12-02T12:29:53.872Z\"\n    },\n    \"library\": {\n      \"name\": \"analytics-node\",\n      \"version\": \"0.0.3\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"rudderId\": \"754fe90e-89fb-4d71-9d11-3ec2b91b5777\",\n  \"_metadata\": {\n    \"nodeVersion\": \"10.22.0\"\n  },\n  \"messageId\": \"node-1a585828272cf1116407aaf6be3921f2-65c1670e-f4e1-4283-a7a5-0a60825c4f83\",\n  \"originalTimestamp\": \"2020-12-02T13:04:05.951Z\"\n}\n```\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### Where can I find my MoEngage API ID and API key?\n\nYou can find your MoEngage API ID and API key in your [MoEngage dashboard](https://app.moengage.com/) under **Settings** > **APIs** > **DATA API Settings**.\n\nFor more information, refer to the [MoEngage documentation](https://developers.moengage.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404674776724-Overview#:~:text=Navigate%20to%20Settings%20%3E%20APIs%20%3E%20DATA,ID%20Password%20%2D%20DATA%20API%20KEY).\n\n#### Where can I see the events that are sent to MoEngage?\n\nTo view the events sent to MoEngage, go to **For developers** > **Recent Events** in your MoEngage dashboard. If your app is in debug mode, then you can view the events under the **Test** tab, otherwise you can view them under the **Live** tab.\n\nQuestions?

You can thus send event data attached to Keen collections using RudderStack APIs.\n\n## Getting started\n\nRudderStack supports sending event data to Keen via the following [connection modes](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/):\n\n| **Connection Mode** | **Web** | **Mobile** | **Server** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Device mode** | **Supported** | \\-  | \\-  |\n| **Cloud mode** | **Supported** | **Supported** | **Supported** |\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> In a web device mode integration, that is, using [JavaScript SDK](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/) as a source, the Keen native SDK is loaded from `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/` domain. Based on your website’s content security policy, you might need to [allowlist this domain](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/load-js-sdk/#allowlist-destination-domain) to load the Keen SDK successfully.\n\nOnce you have confirmed that the platform supports sending events to Keen, perform the steps below:\n\n*   From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderlabs.com/), add the source. From the list of destinations, select **Keen**.\n*   Give a name to the destination and click **Next**. You should then see the following screen:\n\n[![](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/image%20%2824%29.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/image%20%2824%29.webp)\n\nConnection Settings for Keen in RudderStack\n\n*   Please enter the **Project ID** and **Write Key**.\n*   You can enable the **Use native SDK to send events** setting to send events via [device mode](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#device-mode) through Keen’s native JavaScript SDK.\n\n### Configuring Add-ons\n\nIf enabled, RudderStack attaches the following Keen add-ons to the events, which helps in their data enrichment before routing them to Keen:\n\n| Add-on | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Geo IP Add On** | The enriched output will be available under the `ip_geo_info` key. |\n| **User Agent Add On** | The enriched output will be available under the `parsed_user_agent` key. |\n| **URL Parsing Add On** | The enriched output will be available under the `parsed_page_url` key. |\n| **Referrer Parsing Add On** | The enriched output will be available under the `referrer_info` key. |\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Note: We only pass the IP, page and referrer add-ons to Keen if the event contains a valid `ip`, `page`, `URL` and `referrer` property.\n\n[![](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/image%20%2838%29.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/image%20%2838%29.webp)\n\nKeen add-ons settings in RudderStack\n\n*   Once you have finalized all settings, click **Next** to complete the configuration. Keen will now be added as a destination in RudderStack.\n\n## Identify\n\nCalling `rudderanalytics.identify()` has no effect on Keen whatsoever, when called from the server-side SDKs. However, when called from client-side SDKs, RudderStack calls the Keen `extendEvents`with a user object `userId`and traits passed in from the `identify` call.\n\nCalling `extendEvents` adds the user object to all subsequent`recordEvent` calls to Keen. Hence, to view the `identify` data , you will have to make a subsequent `page` and `track` call from RudderStack.\n\nA sample `identify` call is as shown in the following code snippet:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify(\"my-userID\", {\n  name: \"Tintin\",\n  city: \"Brussels\",\n  country: \"Belgium\",\n  email: \"tintin@herge.com\",\n});\n```\n\nThis will pass the below user to every subsequent event data:\n\n```\nuser: {\n  userId: \"my-userID\",\n  traits: {\n    name: \"Tintin\",\n    city: \"Brussels\",\n    country: \"Belgium\",\n    email: \"tintin@herge.com\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Page\n\nCalling `rudderanalytics.page()` will pass the `page` properties to the Keen collection `Viewed <category> <name> page`. To learn more about the `page`call, please refer to our [RudderStack Events Specification](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/) documentation.\n\nA sample `page` call is as shown in the snippet below:\n\n```\n// \"home\" is the name of the page.\nrudderanalytics.page(\"home\", {\n  path: \"path\",\n  url: \"url\",\n  title: \"title\",\n  search: \"search\",\n  referrer: \"referrer\"\n});\n```\n\nThis will send the following properties to the Keen `Viewed Home Page` collection:\n\n*   `path`\n*   `url`\n*   `title`\n*   `search`\n*   `referrer`\n*   `userId`\n*   `user traits` (If coming from the client SDKs)\n\n## Track\n\nCalling `rudderanalytics.track()` will pass the event properties to Keen on the collection `event-name`. To learn more about the `track`call, please refer to our [RudderStack Events Specification](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/) documentation.\n\nAn example `track` call is as shown:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"Track me\", {\n  category: \"category\",\n  label: \"label\",\n  value: \"value\",\n});\n```\n\nThe above call will send the following properties to Keen’s `Track me` collection:\n\n*   `category`\n*   `label`\n*   `value`\n*   `userId`\n*   `user traits` (If coming from the client SDKs)\n\n## Screen\n\nThe `screen` call records the screen views of the user in your App. If you have turned on the screen views in your App implementation from the \\[[iOS](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-ios-sdk/) or [Android](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-android-sdk/) SDK it will be registered in your dashboard. We’ll forward the `properties` you’ve passed along with the `screen` call as it is.\n\nHere is a sample `screen` call in using RudderStack iOS SDK.\n\n```\n[[RudderClient sharedInstance] screen:@\"Main\"\n            properties:@{@\"prop_key\" : @\"prop_value\"}];\n```\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### Where do I get the Project ID and Write Key for configuring Keen on RudderStack?\n\nYou will find the **Project ID** and **Write Key** by navigating to **Projects** - (select your project) - **Access** - **Project Details**.\n\nQuestions?

    "markdown": "# Lotame | RudderStack Docs\n\nSend your event data from RudderStack to Lotame.\n\n* * *\n\n*     6 minute read  \n    \n\n[Lotame](https://www.lotame.com/) is a popular data management and enrichment platform, used mainly for digital advertising. Its unique data solutions allow you to find new customers, improve engagement with them, and grow your revenue.\n\nRudderStack supports syncing Lotame’s **BCP Pixel** and **DSP Pixel** through our `page` and `identify` call.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> *   **BCP**:The BCP, or **Behavior Collection Point**, is a JavaScript snippet that is placed on a web page. It is responsible for capturing the relevant user activity.\n> *   **DSP:** The DSP, or **Demand-Side Platform**, allows digital advertising inventory buyers to manage their ad exchange as well as data exchange accounts through a single interface.\n\n## Getting started\n\nRudderStack supports sending event data to Lotame via the following [connection modes](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/):\n\n| **Connection Mode** | **Web** | **Mobile** | **Server** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Device mode** | **Supported** | **Supported** | \\-  |\n| **Cloud mode** | \\-  | \\-  | \\-  |\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> In a web device mode integration, that is, using [JavaScript SDK](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/) as a source, the Lotame native SDK is loaded from the URL you provide in the **DSP URL Settings (Pixel)** section in the RudderStack dashboard. Based on your website’s content security policy, you might need to [allowlist this domain](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/load-js-sdk/#allowlist-destination-domain) to load the Lotame SDK successfully.\n\nOnce you have confirmed that the platform supports sending events to Lotame, perform the steps below:\n\n*   From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderlabs.com/), select Lotame as a destination.\n*   Give a name to the destination and select the source to connect to this destination. Then, click **Next**. You should see the following screen:\n\n[![Lotame Destination Settings on the RudderStack dashboard](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/image%20%2825%29.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/image%20%2825%29.webp)\n\nYou can provide multiple BCP and DSP URL templates in the settings dashboard by clicking on the **ADD MORE** option as seen above. Once specified, RudderStack includes these sources of image pixels in the web app. To provide the URLs, please use the below template:\n\n```\nhttps://bcp.crwdcntrl.net/1/c={{clientId}}/b={{behavioralId}}\n```\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack supports simple Handlebar expressions for the URLs. It uses the values provided by you in the **Map all fields** section to replace the expressions, and the final URL as `src`.\n\n## Adding Lotame to your mobile project\n\nPlease follow the steps below to add Lotame to your Android Project:\n\n1.  Add the following `repository` to your `app/build.gradle` file.\n\n```\nrepositories {\n    mavenCentral()\n}\n```\n\n2.  Then, add the following `dependencies` in the same file:\n\n```\nimplementation 'com.rudderstack.android.sdk:core:1.+'\nimplementation 'com.rudderstack.android.integration:lotame:1.+'\n```\n\n3.  Finally, change the initialization of your `RudderClient` in your `Application` class, as shown in the snippet below:\n\n```\n// initialize Rudder SDK\nval rudderClient =\n    RudderClient.getInstance(\n        this,\n        WRITE_KEY,\n        RudderConfig.Builder()\n            .withDataPlaneUrl(DATA_PLANE_URL)\n            .withFactory(LotameIntegrationFactory.FACTORY)\n            .build()\n    )\n```\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> If your Lotame URLs follow the HTTP protocol, you need to allow **`ClearTextTraffic`** for your app. To do so, add **`android:usesCleartextTraffic=\"true\"`** in the **`<application>`** tag of your app’s `Android Manifest` file. After adding this, the file should look like the following:\n> \n> ```\n> <application ...=\"\" android:usescleartexttraffic=\"true\">\n> <activity>\n>       ...\n>     </activity>\n> </application>\n> ```\n\n1.  Open the `Podfile` of your project and add the following line\n\nfollowed by\n\n2.  Finally change the SDK initialization with the following\n\n```\nRSConfigBuilder *builder = [[RSConfigBuilder alloc] init];\n[builder withDataPlaneUrl:DATA_PLANE_URL];\n[builder withFactory:[RudderLotameFactory instance]];\n[builder withLoglevel:RSLogLevelDebug];\n[RSClient getInstance:WRITE_KEY config:[builder build]];\n```\n\n## Identify\n\nFor each `identify` call, RudderStack will sync the DSP Pixels provided by you in the **DSP URL Settings**, in the destination configuration settings. As DSP Pixels need to be synced for every user only once in 7 days, RudderStack will sync the DSP Pixels in every `identify` call and if the same user remains active after 7 days, it syncs the same DSP Pixels in subsequent `page` calls once in every 7 days.\n\nA sample `identify` call is as shown in the code snippet below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify(\"12345\", {\n  name: \"my-name\",\n  email: \"name@domain.com\",\n  country: \"India\",\n})\n```\n\nThe above identify call will sync the DSP Pixel, modify the template to place the `userId` in the source URL where required, and use it as `{{userId}}` in the template:\n\n```\nhttp://ab.cdef.com/getapi?http://sync.crwdcntrl.net/map/c={{clientId}}/rand={{random}}/tpid={{userId}}/tp={{clientIdSpace}}\n```\n\nRudderStack will replace the `{{userId}}` expression with the `userId` provided in the [`identify`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/identify/#sample-payload) call. We will also replace `{{random}}` with a random value. The rest of the expression’s values (`{{clientId}}` , `{{clientIdSpace}}` ) are to be provided in the mapping fields section, i.e. **Map all fields** section in the Destination Settings, as covered in the Getting Started section.\n\n#### Important Notes\n\n*   If you mention `userId` in the URL template in the Destination Settings, RudderStack replaces it the with the ID from the `identify` call.\n*   RudderStack also replaces the value of the `{{random}}` expression with a random integer.\n\n## Page\n\nFor each `page` call, RudderStack will load the BCP **Pixels**. A `page` call with a payload having `userId` triggers the syncing of DSP Pixels once in every **7 days** too. So, a [`page`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/page/) call serves the purpose of loading BCP Pixels and syncing DSP Pixels.\n\nA sample `page` call is as shown:\n\n## Screen\n\nFor each `screen` call, RudderStack will send `GET` requests for BCP Pixels. A `screen` call with a payload having `userId` triggers the syncing of DSP Pixels once in every **7 days** too. So, a[`screen`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/screen/) call serves the purpose of sending requests for BCP Pixels and syncing DSP Pixels.\n\nA sample `screen` call is as shown:\n\n```\n[[RSClient sharedInstance] screen];\n```\n\n## Sync Pixel Callback\n\nTo get a track of every sync Pixel call (once in every 7 days), you may register a function that will be executed when the syncing of DSP Pixels takes place from the SDK.\n\nUse the web SDK [`ready` API](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-sdk-js#step-4-check-ready-state) to register the callback. We execute the function provided in `LOTAME_SYNCH_CALLBACK` window object after calling the sync pixels.\n\n1.  An example of the above is as shown:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.ready(() => {\n  window.LOTAME_SYNCH_CALLBACK = () => {\n    rudderanalytics.track(\n      \"synch lotame\",\n      {},\n      {\n        integrations: { All: false, S3: true },\n      }\n    )\n  }\n})\n```\n\n2.  The above callback triggers a call to RudderStack SDK’s `track` API which dumps the `track` call payload to a configured S3 destination in your RudderStack dashboard, each time the syncing of the DSP Pixels happens.\n\nUse the `onIntegrationReady` method to register the `onSync` callback (which will be called every time the DSP URLs are synced). You’ll get notified for all sync pixels through this callback. You’ll receive the type of the pixel and the final compiled URL through the callback.\n\n```\nrudderClient!!.onIntegrationReady(\"Lotame Mobile\") {\n    (it as LotameIntegration).registerCallback { urlType, url ->\n        // urlType => \"bcp\", \"dsp\"\n        // url => complete url with all values replaced\n        println(\"LotameSync: $urlType : $url\")\n    }\n}\n```\n\nRegister your callback to get notified when the pixel has been synced\n\n```\n[LotameIntegration registerCallback:^{\n    // your custom code\n}];\n```\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### How and when does the syncing of DSP Pixels take place?\n\nSyncing of DSP Pixels happens in each `identify` call, and once in 7 days for `page` calls having `userId` in payload. RudderStack stores the sync timestamp in storage. So, in every `page` call for web and in every `screen` call for mobile platform, RudderStack checks for the identified user (i.e. payload having `userId`) and the last syncing timestamp. If it is before 7 days or more, RudderStack automatically triggers the syncing.\n\n#### How do we validate the Pixels on Mobile devices?\n\nYou can validate the Pixels in two ways on Mobile devices.\n\n1.  You can register a [Sync Callback](#sync-pixel-callback) with `rudderClient` and you’ll get the type of the pixel which is getting fired along with the compiled URL with values replaced. We replace the `userId` and `advertisingId` automatically. For other values, you can use the settings on the [dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/).\n2.  You can turn on `DEBUG` log in your `rudderClient` initialization. It’ll also set the `DEBUG` logging in Lotame implementation. And you can check logs generated by the SDK. It’ll help you to understand the steps taken by the SDK.\n\nQuestions? Contact us by [email](mailto:docs@rudderstack.com) or on [Slack](https://rudderstack.com/join-rudderstack-slack-community)",

Also, you can add people to your Mailchimp list via a simple `identify` call.\n\n## Getting started\n\nBefore configuring Mailchimp as a destination in RudderStack, verify if the source platform is supported by Mailchimp by referring to the table below:\n\n| **Connection Mode** | **Web** | **Mobile** | **Server** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Device mode** | \\-  | \\-  | \\-  |\n| **Cloud mode** | **Supported** | **Supported** | **Supported** |\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> To learn more about the difference between Cloud mode and Device mode in RudderStack, see [Connection modes](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/).\n\nOnce you have confirmed that the source platform supports sending events to Mailchimp, follow these steps:\n\n1.  From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add a source. Then, from the list of destinations, select **Mailchimp**.\n2.  Assign a name to the destination and click **Continue**.\n\n### Connection settings\n\nTo successfully configure Mailchimp as a destination, you will need to configure the following settings:\n\n[![](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/mailchimp-connection-settings.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/mailchimp-connection-settings.webp)\n\n*   **Mailchimp API Key**: Enter your Mailchimp API Key.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> It is recommended to create a new API key for the RudderStack destination. Mailchimp restricts each API key to a maximum of 10 concurrent requests. Hence, creating a dedicated key for RudderStack ensures maximum throughput for the outgoing calls. Refer to the [Mailchimp documentation](https://mailchimp.com/help/about-api-keys/) for more detaails.\n\n*   **Mailchimp Audience ID**: Enter your Mailchimp Audience ID.\n*   **Mailchimp DataCenter ID**: Enter your Mailchimp DataCenter ID.\n*   **Enable Merge fields**: Enable this setting if you want to add merge fields while updating a subscriber.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Refer to the [FAQ](#faq) section for more information on how to get the above details.\n\n## Identify\n\nThe [`identify`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/identify/) call captures the details about the visiting user along with the properties associated with that user.\n\n### Adding or updating a user\n\nA sample `identify` call is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify(\"1hKOmRA4el9Zt1WSfVJIVo4GRlm\", {\n    firstName: \"Alex\",\n    lastName: \"Keener\",\n    email: \"alex@example.com\"\n});\n```\n\nEvery time an `identify` call is made including an email address, RudderStack performs the following steps:\n\n*   RudderStack first checks with Mailchimp whether that specific email address exists for the `listId` provided in the destination settings.\n*   If the email address does not exist in the list, RudderStack subscribes the associated user to the list immediately. If the `doubleOptIn` setting is enabled, Mailchimp sends a confirmation email to that user, and that email is tagged with a `pending` subscriber status. The subscriber status automatically changes to `subscribed` once the user confirms the email.\n*   If the user already has a subscriber status such as `pending`, `subscribed`, `unsubscribed` or `cleaned`, RudderStack will **not** resubscribe them, but only update their associated user traits.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> `email` is a required field for the `identify` call. The rest of the fields must match the **Merge Field** tag in Mailchimp.\n\n### Capture custom user traits\n\nYou can capture the custom user traits in the Mailchimp list dashboard by [creating a custom merge field](#creating-custom-merge-fields) in Mailchimp.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Mailchimp supports merge tags only up to 10 characters. Hence, every user trait sent inside the `identify` call is trimmed to the first 10 characters and converted to uppercase before being sent to Mailchimp. Also, the `Merge Tags` is created by taking the 10 characters (excluding whitespace/special characters) of its `Field Label`.\n> \n> For example, if you set the `Field Label` as `Upto 10-Char`, the `Merge Tag` will be `UPTO10CHAR`. The `user.trait` inside your `identify` call, which is, `Upto 10-Char`, will be converted to `UPTO10CHAR` before being sent to Mailchimp.\n\n### Creating custom merge fields\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Create custom merge fields only for the traits you want to see in your list view and not for all `user.traits`.\n\nTo create and send custom merge fields or user traits to Mailchimp, please follow these steps:\n\n*   Create the merge field in Mailchimp for every trait you want sent to it.\n*   When you make the `identify` call, the keys that match the traits above will automatically appear in your Mailchimp list.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> The `identify` call will **not change** in this case.\n\n### Overriding `listId`\n\nIf you have multiple lists that your users can subscribe to, you can override the default `listId` as a parameter to Mailchimp.\n\nThe following sample snippet overrides the default `listId` with `esf1rd234a` as `listId`:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify(\n  \"1hKOmRA4el9Zt1WSfVJIVo4GRlm\",\n  {\n    email: \"alex@example.com\"\n  },\n  {\n    integrations: {\n      MailChimp: {\n        listId: \"esf1rd234a\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n);\n```\n\n### Updating the subscription status\n\nRudderStack provides you with the option to manually update the subscription status of a user by passing the `subscriptionStatus` parameter to Mailchimp.\n\nAn example is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify(\n  \"1hKOmRA4el9Zt1WSfVJIVo4GRlm\",\n  {\n    email: \"alex@example.com\"\n  },\n  {\n    integrations: {\n      MailChimp: {\n        subscriptionStatus: \"unsubscribed\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n);\n```\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> This setting will **NOT** work for new users. For new users, the subscription status will always be set as `pending` or `subscribed`, depending on the set `doubleOptIn` setting.\n\n## Track\n\nYou can use the [`track`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/track/) call to track user actions or [trigger targeted automations](https://mailchimp.com/developer/marketing/guides/track-outside-activity-events/#trigger-automations-with-events) in Mailchimp using their [Events](https://mailchimp.com/developer/marketing/api/list-member-events/) API.\n\nA sample `track` call is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"registered_referral\", {\n  \"referee_id\": \"1233\",\n  \"referral_acceptance\": \"accepted\",\n  \"email\": \"alex@example.com\"\n})\n```\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> `email` is a required field for making a `track` call successfully. You can pass it in either `traits.email`, `ucontext.traits.email`, or `properties.email`. RudderStack hashes the `email` field and replaces `subscriber_hash` in the [Mailchimp Events API endpoint](https://mailchimp.com/developer/marketing/api/list-member-events/).\n\n### Supported mappings\n\nThe following table lists the mappings between the RudderStack and Mailchimp properties:\n\n| RudderStack property | Mailchimp property | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `event`  <br>Required | `name` | Event name must contain 2-30 characters. |\n| `properties` | `properties` | \\-  |\n| `properties.isSyncing` | `is_syncing` | RudderStack triggers the [targeted automations](https://mailchimp.com/developer/marketing/guides/track-outside-activity-events/#trigger-automations-with-events) by default. However, you can set `isSyncing` to `true` if you don’t want to trigger them. |\n| `originalTimestamp` | `occurred_at` | \\-  |\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack stringifies all values received in `properties[key]` as Mailchimp only accepts the string values in `properties[key]`.\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### Where do I get the Mailchimp API Key?\n\nTo get the Mailchimp API Key, log in to Mailchimp, and go to **Account** > **Extras** > **API Keys**.\n\n#### Where do I get the Mailchimp Audience ID?\n\nYou can find the Mailchimp Audience ID by logging in to Mailchimp and navigating to **Audience** > **Manage Audience** > **Settings** > **Audience name and defaults**.\n\n#### Where do I get the Mailchimp DataCenter ID?\n\nTo get the DataCenter ID, please refer to your Mailchimp URL in the browser. For example, if the URL is `https://us20.admin.mailchimp.com/lists`, the DataCenter ID is `us20` in this case.\n\nQuestions?

    "markdown": "# Klaviyo destination | RudderStack Docs\n\nSend your event data from RudderStack to Klaviyo.\n\n* * *\n\n*     9 minute read  \n    \n\n[Klaviyo](https://www.klaviyo.com/) is a powerful ecommerce platform that lets you boost your business revenue. It offers unique features like category-based segmentation and various event triggers based on page views, purchases, email engagement, etc.\n\nFind the open source transformer code for this destination in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-transformer/tree/master/src/v0/destinations/klaviyo).\n\n## Setup\n\n1.  In your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), go to **Directory** > **Destinations** > **Cloud Destinations** and search for **Klaviyo**.\n2.  Connect your source and click **Continue**.\n\n### Connection settings\n\nConfigure the following settings to set up Klaviyo as a destination in RudderStack:\n\n*   **Name**: Assign a name to uniquely identify the destination.\n*   **Public API Key**: Enter the unique public API key from your [Klaviyo dashboard](https://www.klaviyo.com/login) (present under **Settings** > **Account**).\n*   **Private API Key**: Enter the private API key from your [Klaviyo dashboard](https://www.klaviyo.com/login) (present under **Settings** > **Account**). This key lets you add users to a list or subscribe them using personalised emails/SMS.\n\n### Connection mode\n\nSpecify how you want to route events from your source to Klaviyo.\n\nRudderStack supports sending events to Klaviyo via the following [connection modes](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/):\n\n| Connection mode | Web | Mobile | Server |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Device mode | **Supported** | \\-  | \\-  |\n| Cloud mode | **Supported** | **Supported** | **Supported** |\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> In a web device mode integration, that is, using [JavaScript SDK](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/) as a source, RudderStack loads the Klaviyo native SDK from `https://static.klaviyo.com/` domain. Based on your website’s content security policy, you might need to [allowlist this domain](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/load-js-sdk/#allowlist-destination-domain) to load the Klaviyo SDK successfully.\n\n### Configuration settings\n\nAfter completing the initial setup, configure the following settings to correctly receive your data in Klaviyo:\n\n#### **List and subscription settings**\n\n*   **List Id**: Enter the default list ID to which you want to add or subscribe the identified users.\n*   **Consent**: Select the consent type from **E-mail**, **SMS**, or both. `consent` is a Klaviyo-specific property that you need to include in your events if you run a GDPR-compliant business.\n\n#### **Event-specific settings**\n\n*   **Enable this option to make email as primary identifier**: Turn on this setting to set a custom attribute `_id` and `$email` as the primary identifier when passed in `traits.email`/`properties.email`. RudderStack **does not** set `$id` field to the `userId` while sending the events.\n    \n    When disabled, RudderStack uses `userId` (`anonymousId`, if `userId` is absent) for mapping the user with a unique identifier. In case `userId` and `anonymousId` are absent, RudderStack sends `email` or `phone` as the user’s primary identifier.\n    \n    > ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n    > \n    > Note that:\n    > \n    > *   This setting is applicable for [`identify`](#identify) and [`track`](#track) calls.\n    > *   Use this setting only if you are experiencing issues with duplicate profiles created in your Klaviyo account.\n    \n*   **Enable to flatten user/event properties**: Turn on this setting to flatten the user properties in [`identify`](#identify) and event properties in [`track`](#track) calls before sending them to Klaviyo.\n    \n\n#### **Web SDK settings**\n\nUse the following settings to configure Klaviyo’s native web SDK:\n\n*   **Send Page As Track**: Turn on this setting to send `page` events as `track` events along with the event `name` and `category`.\n*   **Additional Page info**: Turn on this setting to send `page` events as `track` events and send additional properties for the event.\n\n#### **Other settings**\n\n*   **Client-side Events Filtering**: This setting lets you specify which events should be blocked or allowed to flow through to Klaviyo. See [Client-side Events Filtering](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/event-filtering/) guide for more information.\n*   **OneTrust Cookie Categories**: This setting lets you associate the [OneTrust](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/data-governance/consent-management/onetrust/javascript/) cookie consent groups to Klaviyo.\n\n## Identify\n\nThe [`identify`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/identify/) call lets you identify a visiting user and associate them to their actions. It also lets you record the traits about them like their name, email address, etc.\n\n> ![success](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/tick.svg)\n> \n> You can send any number of key-value pairs as user traits and RudderStack updates them as [custom profile properties](https://help.klaviyo.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005074627) in Klaviyo.\n\nTo create a new user in Klaviyo, you must pass either the `userId`, `email`, or `phone` properties in the `identify` call. If a user already exists, RudderStack updates the user profile with the latest values.\n\nA sample `identify` call is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify(\"userid\", {\n  firstName: \"Name\",\n  lastName: \"Surname\",\n  email: \"name@website.com\",\n  phone: \"+12 345 678 900\",\n  userId: \"userId\",\n  title: \"Owner\",\n  organization: \"Company\",\n  city: \"Tokyo\",\n  region: \"ABC\",\n  country: \"JP\",\n  zip: \"100-0001\",\n  Flagged: false,\n  Residence: \"Shibuya\",\n  properties: {\n    listId: \"XUepkK\",\n    subscribe: true,\n    consent: \"email\",\n    smsConsent: true,\n  },\n})\n```\n\nNote that specifying `consent` and `smsConsent` in the event properties overrides the respective settings in the RudderStack dashboard.\n\n### Add and subscribe user to list\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> This feature is available only in the [cloud mode](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#cloud-mode) integration.\n\nYou can add and subscribe a user to a Klaviyo list by specifying the **List ID** in the RudderStack dashboard and setting the `subscribe` option to `true`. Alternatively, you can add `listId` within the event properties - this will override the **List ID** specified in the dashboard for that particular event.\n\nIf you have enabled the **Double opt-in** setting for a list in Klaviyo, users will not be added to the list automatically without their consent. To add users to a list automatically without waiting for their consent, select the **Single opt-in** option in that list’s settings:\n\n[![Destination Settings for Klaviyo](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/Klaviyo-setting.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/Klaviyo-setting.webp)\n\n## Track\n\nThe [`track`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/track/) call lets you record the user actions along with any properties associated with them.\n\nA sample `track` call is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"Checked Out\", {\n  Clicked_Rush_delivery_Button: true,\n  total_value: 2000,\n  Ordered: [\"T-Shirt\", \"jacket\"],\n  revenue: 2000,\n})\n```\n\nIn the above snippet, RudderStack captures the information related to the `Checked Out` event, along with the details of the event.\n\nTo associate a user with an event, you need to pass either their `userId`, `email`, or `phone` in the `track` call. A sample server-side `track` call along with the user information is as shown:\n\n```\nclient.track({\n  userId: \"user2\",\n  event: \"Item Purchased\",\n  properties: {\n    revenue: 97.5,\n    products: [\n      {\n        productId: \"pro1\",\n        price: 32.5,\n        quantity: 3,\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n  context: {\n    traits: {\n      email: \"user2@gmail.com\",\n    },\n  },\n})\n```\n\nIn the above snippet, RudderStack captures the information related to the `Item Purchased` event, along with its additional information in `properties`. Moreover, since this event is captured using a server-side SDK, RudderStack passes the user information in `context` along with a unique `userId`.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> *   To send `track` or `screen` type event using an SDK that does not persist user context information after `identify`, you need to pass the information in `context.traits`.\n> *   To set a specific value to the `screen` or `track` type event, you need to pass the event-related property in the `properties` field. Also, you can send `revenue` property in the `track` event and RudderStack will automatically map it to Klaviyo’s special property `$value`.\n\n### Ecommerce event mapping\n\nRudderStack converts the following ecommerce events to the corresponding Klaviyo events:\n\n| **RudderStack event** | **Klaviyo event** |\n| --- | --- |\n| `Product Viewed`  <br>`Product Clicked` | `Viewed Product` |\n| `Product Added` | `Added to Cart` |\n| `Checkout Started` | `Started Checkout` |\n\nIn addition to the above, RudderStack sends the following:\n\n*   **Customer properties**: Must contain either the `email` or `phone_number`. RudderStack extracts these customer properties from `traits`/`context.traits` in the `track` call.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> As mentioned above, you can send any number of key-value pairs as user traits and RudderStack updates them as [custom profile properties](https://help.klaviyo.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005074627) in Klaviyo.\n\n*   **Token**: Public API key from the RudderStack dashboard.\n\nAdditionally, you can choose to send specific fields for each of the events covered in the following sections:\n\n#### Product Viewed\n\nRudderStack maps the `Product Viewed` event to `Viewed Product` and maps the following event properties:\n\n| **RudderStack property** | **Klaviyo property** |\n| --- | --- |\n| `name` | `ProductName` |\n| `product_id` | `ProductID` |\n| `sku` | `SKU` |\n| `image_url` | `ImageURL` |\n| `url` | `URL` |\n| `brand` | `Brand` |\n| `price` | `Price` |\n| `compare_at_price` | `CompareAtPrice` |\n| `categories` | `Categories` |\n\n#### Product Added\n\nRudderStack maps the `Product Added` event to `Added to Cart` and maps the following event properties:\n\n| **RudderStack property** | **Klaviyo property** |\n| --- | --- |\n| `value` | `$value` |\n| `name` | `AddedItemProductName` |\n| `product_id` | `AddedItemProductID` |\n| `sku` | `AddedItemSKU` |\n| `image_url` | `AddedItemImageURL` |\n| `url` | `AddedItemURL` |\n| `price` | `AddedItemPrice` |\n| `quantity` | `AddedItemQuantity` |\n| `categories` | `AddedItemCategories` |\n| `item_names` | `ItemNames` |\n| `checkout_url` | `CheckoutURL` |\n| `items` (deprecating soon)  <br>`products` | `Items` |\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> `properties.items` will be deprecated soon.\n\nFurthermore, `products`/`items` can contain the following parameters:\n\n| **RudderStack parameters** | **Klaviyo parameters** |\n| --- | --- |\n| `product_id` | `ProductID` |\n| `sku` | `SKU` |\n| `name` | `ProductName` |\n| `quantity` | `Quantity` |\n| `price` | `Price` |\n| `total` | `RowTotal` |\n| `url` | `URL` |\n| `image_url` | `ImageURL` |\n| `categories` | `ProductCategories` |\n\n#### Checkout Started\n\nRudderStack maps the `Checkout Started` event name to `Started Checkout` and maps the following event properties:\n\n| **RudderStack Parameters** | **Klaviyo Parameters** |\n| --- | --- |\n| `order_id` | `$event_id` |\n| `value` | `$value` |\n| `categories` | `Categories` |\n| `item_names` | `ItemNames` |\n| `items` (deprecating soon)  <br>`products` | `Items` |\n| `checkout_url` | `CheckoutURL` |\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> `properties.items` will be deprecated soon.\n\nFurthermore, `products` / `items` can contain the following parameters:\n\n| **RudderStack parameters** | **Klaviyo parameters** |\n| --- | --- |\n| `product_id` | `ProductID` |\n| `sku` | `SKU` |\n| `name` | `ProductName` |\n| `quantity` | `Quantity` |\n| `price` | `Price` |\n| `total` | `RowTotal` |\n| `url` | `URL` |\n| `image_url` | `ImageURL` |\n| `categories` | `ProductCategories` |\n\nA sample `track` call containing the above ecommerce event parameters is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"checkout started \", {\n  order_id: \"1234\",\n  value: 12.34,\n  categories: [\"category1\", \"category2\"],\n  checkout_url: \"http://www.testcall.com\",\n  item_names: [\"item1\", \"item2\"],\n  products: [{\n      product_id: \"pId1\",\n      sku: \"sku1\",\n      name: \"item1\",\n      url: \"https://www.item1URL.com\",\n      price: 1.0,\n      quantity: 1,\n      image_url: \"https://www.item1Image.com,\n      categories: [\"category1\", \"category2\"],\n      row_total: 1.0\n    },\n    {\n      product_id: \"pId2\",\n      sku: \"sku2\",\n      name: \"item2\",\n      url: \"https://www.item2URL.com\",\n      price: 2.0,\n      quantity: 1,\n      image_url: \"https://www.item2Image.com,\n      categories: [\"category1\", \"category2\"],\n      row_total: 2.0\n    },\n  ],\n});\n```\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> When sending events via web device mode, specifying `order_id` is not mandatory, as Klaviyo automatically assigns the timestamp to the event. However, if explicitly specified, it **must be unique**. Klaviyo automatically discards the events containing a duplicate `order_id`.\n\n## Page\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack supports sending `page` events to Klaviyo only via [device mode](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#device-mode).\n\nThe [`page`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/page/) call lets you record your website’s page views with any additional relevant information about the viewed page.\n\nYou can send the `name` and `category` information in the `page` event by enabling the **Send Page As Track** setting in the RudderStack dashboard. To associate the properties with the page view event, enable the **Additional Page info** setting as well.\n\nA sample `page` call is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.page(\"Cart\", \"Cart Viewed\", {\n  path: \"/cart\",\n  referrer: \"test.com\",\n  search: \"term\",\n  title: \"test_item\",\n  url: \"http://test.in\",\n})\n```\n\n## Screen\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack supports sending `screen` events to Klaviyo only via [cloud mode](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#cloud-mode).\n\nThe [`screen`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/screen/) method lets you record whenever a user sees their mobile screen along with any optional properties about the viewed screen.\n\nA sample `screen` call is shown below:\n\n```\n[[RSClient sharedInstance] screen:@\"Sample Screen Name\" properties:@{@\"prop_key\" : @\"prop_value\"}];\n```\n\nIn Klaviyo, the above `screen` call is shown as `Sample Screen Name` along with the associated properties.\n\n## Group\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack supports adding and subscribing users to a specific list via the `group` call only in the [cloud mode](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#cloud-mode) integration.\n\nThe [`group`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/group/) call lets you associate a particular identified user with a group, such as a company, organization, or an account.\n\nTo make a `group` call successfully, you must include either `email` or `phone` in it. A sample server-side `group` call is shown:\n\n```\nclient.group({\n  userId: \"userId\",\n  groupId: \"listId\",\n  traits: {\n    subscribe: true,\n  },\n  context: {\n    traits: {\n      email: \"user.test@gmail.com\",\n      city: \"city\",\n      country: \"country\",\n      zip: \"213456\",\n      age: 23,\n      plan: \"free\",\n      consent: \"email\",\n      phone: \"1-617-555-1333\"\n    },\n  },\n})\n```\n\nNote that specifying `consent` in the event properties overrides the respective settings in the RudderStack dashboard.\n\nIn the above snippet, the user with the associated traits is added and subscribed to the list as it is set to `true`.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n|     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Error** | **Reason** | **Solution** |\n| \"detail\": \"Duplicate email found: alex@example.com.\" | The identifiers in the event are possibly from different user profiles in Klaviyo. | Make sure that all the identifiers in the event payload belong to the same user profile.<br><br>To update a profile, you can provide the user's email, phone, or user ID. |\n| \"detail\": \"A profile already exists with one of these identifiers.\" |\n\nQuestions?

It lets you create and send impactful email marketing campaigns, newsletters, and automated emails to grow your business.\n\n## Getting started\n\nRudderStack supports sending events to Mailjet via the following [connection modes](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/):\n\n| **Connection Mode** | **Web** | **Mobile** | **Server** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Device mode** | \\-  | \\-  | \\-  |\n| **Cloud mode** | Supported | Supported | Supported |\n\nOnce you have confirmed that the source platform supports sending events to Mailjet, follow these steps:\n\n1.  From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add the source. Then, from the list of destinations, select **Mailjet**.\n2.  Assign a name to your destination and click **Continue**.\n\n### Connection settings\n\nTo successfully set up Mailjet as a destination, you need to configure the following settings:\n\n*   **Mailjet API Key**: Enter your Mailjet API key.\n*   **Mailjet API Secret**: Enter your Mailjet secret key.\n*   **Mailjet Contact List ID**: Enter your Mailjet contact list ID. RudderStack will use this ID if the list ID is not provided via the `externalId` field in the event’s payload.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Refer to the [FAQ](#faq) section for more information on obtaining the Mailjet API Key, secret key, and contact list ID.\n\n*   **Map RudderStack user attributes to Mailjet contact properties**: Use this setting to map your RudderStack event properties to specific custom properties created in the Mailjet dashboard. For more information on creating and managing contact properties, refer to the [Mailjet documentation](https://documentation.mailjet.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043176353-How-to-create-manage-contact-properties-).\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> Mailjet will not create a contact for the event properties configured in the RudderStack dashboard but not created in Mailjet.\n\n## Identify\n\nYou can use the [`identify`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/identify/) call to add or remove a contact in Mailjet. If a contact already exists, RudderStack updates the contact details.\n\nA sample `identify` call is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify('1hKOmRA4el9Z', {\n      firstName: 'Alex',\n      lastName: 'Keener',\n      email: \"alex@example.com\"\n    }, {\n      externalId: [{\n        type: \"listId\",\n        id: \"13314el9Z\"\n      }],\n      integrations: {\n        mailjet: {\n          Action: \"remove\"\n        }\n      }\n    );\n```\n\nWhen sending events to Mailjet, note the following:\n\n*   The `email` field is mandatory. Otherwise, Mailjet rejects the events.\n*   You can specify the Mailjet list ID either in the **Mailjet Contact List ID** setting of the RudderStack dashboard or in the `externalId` field.\n*   You can specify the Mailjet action (adding/removing user) in the `Action` field of the `integrations` object. If no action is specified, RudderStack sets this field to `addnoforce`, by default.\n\n### Supported mappings\n\nThe following table lists the mappings between the RudderStack attributes and the Mailjet properties:\n\n| RudderStack property | Mailjet property |\n| --- | --- |\n| `traits.email`  <br>Required | `Email` |\n| `traits.name` | `Name` |\n| `context.traits.IsExcludedFromCampaigns`  <br>`traits.IsExcludedFromCampaigns` | `IsExcludedFromCampaigns` |\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### Where can I find the Mailjet API key and secret key?\n\nTo obtain your Mailjet API key and secret, follow these steps:\n\n1.  Log into your [Mailjet dashboard](https://app.mailjet.com/account).\n2.  From the top right section of the dashboard, click your name and go to **Account settings** > **REST API** > **API Key Management (Primary and Sub-account)**.

Assign a name to the destination and click **Continue**.\n\n## Connection settings\n\nTo successfully setup Matomo as a destination, you will need to configure the following settings:\n\n*   **Matomo Version**: Choose the Matomo version from the dropdown:\n    \n    *   **Premise Version**: Choose this option if you have an on-premise Matomo setup.\n        *   **Premise URL**: Enter the SDK’s CDN URL in this field.\n    *   **Cloud Version**: Choose this option if you are using Matomo Cloud.\n        *   **Server URL**: Enter your server URL mentioned under the **JavaScript Tracking Code** section in Matomo dashboard.\n*   **Site Id**: Enter your site Id mentioned under the **JavaScript Tracking Code** section in Matomo dashboard.\n    \n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Refer to the [FAQ](#faq) section below for more information on finding the Server URL and Site Id.\n\n### Event settings\n\n[![Matomo connection settings](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/matomo-connection-settings-1.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/matomo-connection-settings-1.webp)\n\n[![Matomo connection settings](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/matomo-connection-settings-2.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/matomo-connection-settings-2.webp)\n\n[![Matomo connection settings](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/matomo-connection-settings-3.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/matomo-connection-settings-3.webp)\n\n*   **Mapping to trigger the Matomo Goal ID for the respective Events**: Enter the **Event Name** and the [Goal Id](https://developer.matomo.org/guides/tracking-javascript-guide#manually-trigger-goal-conversions) to be triggered when that event is called.\n\n> ![success](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/tick.svg)\n> \n> You can specify multiple **Goal Id’s** for one **Event Name** and vice versa.\n\n*   **Mapping to trigger the Matomo standard events for the respective Events**: Enter the event name and pick the standard event from the dropdown to be triggered when that event is called.\n\n> ![success](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/tick.svg)\n> \n> You can specify multiple **Standard Events** for one **Event Name** and vice versa.\n\n*   **Track All Content Impressions**: Enable this setting to scan the entire DOM for all content blocks and track all impressions, once the DOM ready event has been triggered.\n*   **Track Visible Content Impressions**: Enable this setting to scan the entire DOM for all content blocks as soon as the page is loaded. It tracks an impression only if a content block is actually visible. If enabled, also enter the following:\n    *   **Check on Scroll**: Checks whether the previously hidden content blocks became visible meanwhile after a scroll and if yes, then tracks the impression. It is enabled by default.\n    *   **Time interval in ms**: Enter the time to rescan the entire DOM for new content impressions. By default, the rescan is done every 750ms. To disable it, pass the value as 0.\n*   **Log All Content Blocks On Page**: Enable this setting to log all content blocks found within a page to the console. This is useful while debugging/testing the content tracking.\n*   **Enable Heart Beat Timer**: Enable this setting to install a heart beat timer to send additional requests to Matomo to measure the time spent in the visit. These requests will be sent only when the user’s tab is active and in focus and will not track additional actions or pageviews. If enabled, also enter the following:\n    *   **Active Time in seconds**: Enter the time interval after which a ping request should be sent. The default value is 15 seconds, meaning that if a page is viewed for at least 15 seconds, only then a ping request will be sent.\n*   **Enable Link Tracking**: Enable this setting to install link tracking on all applicable link elements.\n*   **Disable Performance Tracking**: Enable this setting to disable the page performance tracking.\n*   **Enable Cross Domain Linking**: Enable this setting to enable cross domain linking. Refer to the [Matomo document](https://developer.matomo.org/api-reference/tracking-javascript#:~:text=enableCrossDomainLinking) for more information.\n*   **Set Cross Domain Linking Timeout**: Enable this setting to set the cross domain linking timeout (in seconds). If enabled, also enter the following:\n    *   **Timeout**: Enter the timeout interval. By default, the two visits across domains are linked together when the link is clicked and the page is loaded within a 180 seconds timeout window.\n*   **Get Cross Domain Linking Url Parameter**: Enable this setting to get the query parameter to append to links to handle cross domain linking. Refer to the [Matomo document](https://developer.matomo.org/api-reference/tracking-javascript#:~:text=getCrossDomainLinkingUrlParameter) for more information.\n*   **Disable Browser Feature Detection**: Enable this setting to disable the browser feature detection.

RudderStack looks up the Marketo Lead objects using these properties.\n> \n> **Without these two fields, all events will fail**.\n\n1.  In your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), go to **Directory** > **Destinations** > **Cloud Destinations** and search for **Marketo**.\n2.  Connect your source and click **Continue**.\n\n### Connection settings\n\nConfigure the following settings to set up Marketo as a destination in RudderStack:\n\n*   **Name**: Assign a name to uniquely identify the destination.\n*   **Munchkin Account ID**: Enter your Munchkin account ID. You can find the Munchkin Account ID by logging into your Marketo instance and going to **Admin** > **Integration** > **Munchkin**. Your Munchkin ID is listed on the main screen in the **Tracking Code** section. For more information, see the [Marketo documentation](https://nation.marketo.com/t5/knowledgebase/how-to-find-your-munchkin-id-for-a-marketo-instance/ta-p/248432).\n*   **Client ID**: Enter your Marketo client ID.\n*   **Client Secret**: Enter your Marketo client secret.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> You can find the client ID and client secret by logging into your Marketo instance and going to **Admin** > **Integration** > **LaunchPoint**. Select the API service and click **View Details** to get the credentials. For more information, see the [FAQ](#how-do-i-obtain-the-marketo-client-id-and-secret) section below.\n\n### Connection mode\n\nSpecify how you want to route events from your source to Marketo.\n\nRudderStack supports sending events to Marketo via the following [connection modes](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/):\n\n| Connection Mode | Web | Mobile | Server |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Device mode** | **\\-** | **\\-** | **\\-** |\n| **Cloud mode** | **Supported** | **Supported** | **Supported** |\n\n### Configuration settings\n\nAfter completing the initial setup, configure the following settings to correctly receive your data in Marketo:\n\n#### Custom Activity Settings\n\n*   **Track anonymous events**: Turn on this setting to track events that don’t contain a `userId`.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> If you disable this setting, events that don’t contain the `userId` field will automatically fail.\n\n*   **Create lead if it does not exist**: RudderStack creates a new Marketo lead if the user is not present. This setting is turned on by default.\n\n#### OneTrust cookie consent settings\n\n*   **OneTrust Cookie Categories**: This setting lets you associate the [OneTrust](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/data-governance/consent-management/onetrust/javascript/) cookie consent groups to Marketo.\n\n### Mappings\n\nThe following settings are associated with the [`track`](#track) events and require you to first [create a Custom Activity in Marketo](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/marketo/using/product-docs/administration/marketo-custom-activities/create-a-custom-activity.html) before sending an event. You also need to approve the activity in order to get the **Custom Activity ID**.\n\n#### **Custom events**\n\n> ![success](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/tick.svg)\n> \n> You can also use the JSON mapper to set up these mappings.\n\n*   **Map events to Marketo Activity ID and Primary Key**: Use this setting to map the event name in `track` call to Marketo’s custom activity ID and the primary key associated with the custom activity. For example, you can map a **Product Clicked** event to a custom activity with primary field `product_id` and activity ID **100001**.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> The primary field for Marketo’s custom activity is marked with an asterisk (`*`).\n\n#### **Lead trait mapping**\n\n*   **Map your traits to Marketo custom fields**: RudderStack maps some of the user traits to the custom Marketo fields by default (listed in the [Supported mappings](#supported-mappings) section). You can use this setting to override the default mappings or map any other traits to the custom Marketo fields.\n\nFor custom Marketo fields, you can use the [list of standard Marketo fields](https://developers.marketo.com/rest-api/lead-database/fields/list-of-standard-fields/) (REST API Name column) or any other custom field names existing in your lead records.\n\n#### **Custom activity property map**\n\n*   **Map your event properties to Marketo custom activity’s field**: Use this setting to map your `track` event properties to the Marketo fields listed in your custom activity.\n\nFor example, you can map **Product Clicked** event’s `product_name` property to the Marketo’s `productName` field for the custom activity **Product Wishlisted**.\n\n## Identify\n\nYou can use the [`identify`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/identify/) call to create or update a Lead object in Marketo.\n\nA sample `identify` call is as shown:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify(\"1hKOmRA4GRlm\", {\n  name: \"Alex Keener\",\n  first_name: \"Alex\",\n  last_name: \"Keener\",\n  email: \"alex@example.com\",\n})\n```\n\n### Supported mappings\n\nBy default, RudderStack maps the following `traits` to the Marketo fields:\n\n| RudderStack trait | Marketo field |\n| --- | --- |\n| `address.city` | `city` |\n| `company.name` | `company` |\n| `address.country` | `country` |\n| `email` | `email` |\n| `firstName` | `firstName` |\n| `company.industry` | `industry` |\n| `lastName` | `lastName` |\n| `leadSource` | `leadSource` |\n| `company.employee_count` | `numberOfEmployees` |\n| `phone` | `phone` |\n| `address.zip` | `postalCode` |\n| `rating` | `rating` |\n| `address.state` | `state` |\n| `address.street` | `address` |\n| `title` | `title` |\n| `birthday` | `dateOfBirth` |\n| `website` | `website` |\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> For the rest of the fields that you want to sync with Marketo, you can create a mapping of your traits and custom Marketo fields in the RudderStack dashboard, as specified in the [Lead Mapping settings](#lead-mapping-settings) section.\n\n## Track\n\nYou can use the [`track`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/track/) events to register custom activities in Marketo.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> Note that:\n> \n> *   Make sure to first [create the custom activities in Marketo](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/marketo/using/product-docs/administration/marketo-custom-activities/create-a-custom-activity.html) before sending the events. Also, approve the activity in Marketo to get the **Custom Activity ID**.\n> *   If you are using [RudderStack Open Source](https://app.rudderstack.com/signup?type=opensource), make sure to update your [transformer](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-transformer) version to v1.51.1 or later to send your `track` events to Marketo correctly.\n\nA sample `track` call is as shown in the snippet below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"Order Completed\", {\n  checkout_id: \"C324532\",\n  order_id: \"T1230\",\n  value: 15.98,\n  revenue: 16.98,\n  shipping: 3.0,\n  coupon: \"FY21\",\n  currency: \"INR\",\n})\n```\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### Why are my requests failing with the message “Lookup failed”?\n\nMake sure you have created two fields in Marketo with the names `userId` and `anonymousId`, so that RudderStack can look up the Marketo lead database for `leadId` with the `userId` that are passed along with the event.\n\n#### Why are my `track` events failing?\n\n*   Make sure you have created two fields in Marketo with the API names exactly as `userId` and `anonymousId`. RudderStack looks up the Marketo lead objects using these properties. Without these two fields, all events will fail.\n*   If you’re sending `track` events without `userId`, make sure you have turned on the `Track Anonymous events` setting in the RudderStack dashboard. If this setting is disabled, events that don’t contain the `userId` field will fail.\n\n#### How do I obtain the Marketo client ID and secret?\n\nTo set up the Marketo API service and obtain the client ID and secret associated with it, follow these steps:\n\n1.  Log into your Marketo instance and click the **Admin** tab.\n2.  Select **LaunchPoint**.\n\n[![](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/marketo-launchpoint.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/marketo-launchpoint.webp)\n\n3.  Here, you will able to see all installed services used for connecting to Marketo.\n\n[![](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/marketo-services.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/marketo-services.webp)\n\n4.  To create a new service, click **New** > **New Service**.\n5.  Enter the **Display Name**. From the **Service** dropdown, select **Custom**.\n6.  Under **Settings**, enter the **Description** and select the **API Only User**, as shown. Finally, click **CREATE**.\n\n[![](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/marketo-services.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/marketo-services.webp)\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> Make sure the **API Only User** associated with the API service has the necessary permissions to create or update contacts as wellas the custom activities.\n\nOnce the setup is complete, you should have the client ID and client secret for the API service. Use this to configure the Marketo destination in RudderStack.\n\n[![](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/marketo-service-details.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/marketo-service-details.webp)\n\n  \n\n#### How do I create a custom activity in Marketo?\n\nFor a step-by-step guide on creating a custom activity in Marketo, refer to this [Marketo documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/marketo/using/product-docs/administration/marketo-custom-activities/create-a-custom-activity.html).\n\nQuestions?

It leverages AI-powered insights and cross-channel marketing to help you create personalized experiences for your customers throughout their product journey.\n\nRudderStack supports Ometria as a destination to which you can seamlessly send your customer data.\n\n## Getting started\n\nBefore configuring Ometria as a destination in RudderStack, verify if the source platform is supported by Ometria by referring to the table below:\n\n| **Connection Mode** | **Web** | **Mobile** | **Server** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Device mode** | \\-  | \\-  | \\-  |\n| **Cloud** **mode** | **Supported** | **Supported** | **Supported** |\n\nOnce you have confirmed that your source platform supports sending events to Ometria, follow these steps:\n\n*   From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add the source. From the list of destinations, select **Ometria**.\n*   Assign a name to the destination and click **Next**. You should then see the following screen:\n\n[![Ometria](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/Ometria.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/Ometria.webp)\n\nOmetria\n\n### Connection Settings\n\nThis section details the connection settings required to configure Ometria as a destination in RudderStack.\n\n*   Enter your Ometria **API Token**.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> To get the Ometria API token, go to your your Ometria dashboard and navigate to **Settings** - **API Keys**. Then, click **New API Key**.\n\n*   Under **Contact Settings**, you can choose the **Marketing Optin** status from the dropdown list. By default, it is set to **Explicitly Opted Out**. The different options are:\n    *   **Explicitly Opted In**: The customer is eligible for marketing\n    *   **Explicitly Opted Out**: The customer is not eligible for marketing\n    *   **Not Specified**: No option is specified\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> You can also pass this value in the `identify` call - refer to the **Identify** section below for more details. Note that the value set via the `identify` call will have a higher precedence.\n\n*   Under **SMS Channel Settings**, you can enable **Allow Marketing**. This setting determines whether the contact is opted in or out for SMS marketing. By default, it is **disabled**.\n*   **Allow Transactional**: Enabling or disabling this setting determines if the contact is opted in or out for transactional SMSes. By default, it is **disabled**.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> You can additionally set the values for **Allow Marketing** and **Allow Transactional** via the `identify` call - refer to the **Identify** section below for more details. Note that the value set via the `identify` call will have a higher precedence.\n\n*   Finally, click **Next**. Ometria will now be enabled as a destination in RudderStack.\n\n## Identify\n\nThe `identify` call lets you add a new contact or update an already existing contact in Ometria.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> Note that `listingId` and `email` fields are the mandatory fields for the `identify` call.\n\nYou can set the values for the **Marketing Optin**, **Allow Marketing**, and **Allow Transactional** fields from RudderStack dashboard. You can also send these values using an `integrations` object in the `identify` event payload, **which will have higher precedence**. The SMS channel fields `dt_updated_marketing` and `dt_updated_transactional` can also be passed using this object.\n\nThe `listingId` is the ID specific to a contact in a particular Ometria collection. Note that the `listingId` specified in the `integrations` object will have a higher precedence than the one present in the traits.\n\nA sample `identify` call is as shown:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify(\n  \"userId\",\n  {\n    listingId: \"listingId123\",\n    email: \"sampleuser@testmail.com\",\n    firstName: \"Demo\",\n    lastName: \"Example\",\n    phoneNumber: \"+123451212260\",\n    custom_fields: {\n      field1: \"val1\",\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    integrations: {\n      Ometria: {\n        marketingOptin: \"EXPLICITLY_OPTEDIN\",\n        allow_marketing: true,\n        allow_transactional: true,\n      }\n    }\n  }\n);\n```\n\nA few things to keep in mind while making the `identify` call:\n\n*   The `phoneNumber` field must follow the [E.164](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.164) format. Otherwise, it will be set to `null`.\n*   The `custom_fields` are mapped to the `properties` and will be the used in the `track` call too.\n*   If `custom_fields` is not provided, then RudderStack will create that object with extra fields. Note that these fields must be different from the ones mentioned in the mapping list mentioned in the **Identify Mapping** section below, i.e, the non-default fields.\n*   Inside the `integrations` object, you can additionally send two timestamps - `dt_updated_marketing` and `dt_updated_transactional`. These timestamps must follow the [ISO-8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format.\n\n### Identify Mapping\n\nThe following table includes all `identify` fields with their relative mapping to the Ometria fields:\n\n| **RudderStack Field** | **Ometria Field** |\n| --- | --- |\n| `userId` / `anonymousId` | `customer_id` |\n| `email` | `email` |\n| `listingId` | `id` |\n| `firstName`/`first_name`/`firstname` | `firstname` |\n| `middleName`/ `middle_name` / `middlename` | `middlename` |\n| `lastName`/`last_name`/`lastname` | `lastname` |\n| `phoneNumber` | `phone_number` |\n| `collection` | `@collection` |\n| `prefix` | `prefix` |\n| `dateOfBirth` | `date_of_birth` |\n| `countryId` | `country_id` |\n| `timezone` | `timezone` |\n| `timestampAcquired` | `timestamp_acquired` |\n| `timestampSubscribed` | `timestamp_subscribed` |\n| `timestampUnsubscribed` | `timestamp_unsubscribed` |\n| `storeIds` | `store_ids` |\n| `gender` | `gender` |\n| `removeFromLists` | `@remove_from_lists` |\n| `addToLists` | `@add_to_lists` |\n| `custom_fields` | `properties` |\n| `forceOptin` | `@force_optin` |\n| `merge` | `@merge` |\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> In addition to the above fields, the customer name can also be sent using the `name` field. If the name consists of two words, then `firstname` and `lastname` will be automatically set.\n\n## Track\n\nThe `track` call lets you send custom events to Ometria. Note that `track` also supports ecommerce events and sends them using the **Ometria Order Object**.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> Note that `userId` and `email` are the mandatory fields for the `track` call. `event_id` is required for custom events. If not provided, RudderStack will populate the field with `messageId`.\n\nA sample `track` call for a custom event is as shown:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"Sample Event\", {\n  event_id: \"sample123\",\n  timestamp: \"2017-05-01T14:00:00Z\",\n  profile_id: \"sample\",\n  custom_fields: {\n    field1: \"val1\",\n  },\n});\n```\n\nA few things to note:\n\n*   The event name must be provided in the `track` call.\n*   The `custom_fields` property is mapped to the `properties` object in Ometria. If it is not provided, the non-default Ometria fields will be taken as custom fields.\n*   The `timestamp` field follows the [ISO-8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format. If it is not specified in the correct format, the call will be dropped - i.e., not be sent to Ometria.\n\n### Ometria Custom Event\n\nThe following table includes all RudderStack fields set as custom events in the `track` call, with their relative mapping to the Ometria fields:\n\n| **RudderStack Field** | **Ometria Field** |\n| --- | --- |\n| `event_id` | `id` |\n| `timestamp` | `timestamp` |\n| `custom_fields` | `properties` |\n| `profile_id` | `profile_id` |\n| `email` | `identity_email` |\n| `userId / anonymousId` | `identity_account_id` |\n\n### Ecommerce Events\n\nThe `track` call also lets you record order-related information like `order_id`, `grandtotal`, `timestamp`, `currency`, etc.\n\nRudderStack will create a `customer` object with `userId`, `email`, `firstname` and `lastname` from `context.traits`.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> Note that `order_id`, `timestamp`, `grand_total` and `currency` are the mandatory fields for the `orders` event, while `userId` and `email` are required for `customer` object. You can pass `email` either via the `identify` call or the `track` call’s properties.\n\nThe supported `order` ecommerce events are as listed below:\n\n*   `order completed` / `complete`/ `order complete`\n*   `order shipped` / `shipped`\n*   `order pending` / `pending`\n\nA sample `track` call for an ecommerce order event is as shown:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"order completed\", {\n  order_id: \"order1\",\n  timestamp: \"2017-05-01T14:00:00Z\",\n  currency: \"usd\",\n  grand_total: 1,\n  field1: \"val1\",\n  products: [\n    {\n      product_id: \"prod123\",\n      quantity: 4,\n      subtotal: 10,\n      variant_options:[\n        {\n          type: \"size\",\n          id: \"newid\",\n          label: \"5\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n});\n```\n\nA few things to note:\n\n*   Ometria requires the `currency` field to follow the [ISO 4217](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217) format. If it is invalid, the event will be **dropped**.\n*   If `custom_fields` is not provided, the non-default fields are taken as custom fields. In the above example, `field1` will be mapped as a `custom_fields`.\n*   The `products` field is **not mandatory**. However, if provided, each object should contain `product_id`, `quantity`, and either `subtotal` or `unit_price`. If either of these fields are absent, then that object will be dropped and the `track` call will be made.\n*   RudderStack will set the `status` field according to the event name. For instance, if event name is `order pending` status will be set to `pending`.\n*   The field `is_valid` is always set to `true`. For more information on how to use this field, refer to this [example](https://docs.ometria.com/recipes/how-to-process-a-full-refund).\n\n### Track Orders Mapping\n\nThe following table includes all fields in `track` call for ecommerce orders, with their relative mapping to the Ometria fields:\n\n| **RudderStack Field** | **Ometria Field** |\n| --- | --- |\n| `order_id` | `id` |\n| `timestamp` | `timestamp` |\n| `grand_total` | `grand_total` |\n| `subtotal` | `subtotal` |\n| `discount` | `discount` |\n| `shipping` | `shipping` |\n| `tax` | `tax` |\n| `currency` | `currency` |\n| `web_id` | `web_id` |\n| `ip_address` | `ip_address` |\n| `channel` | `channel` |\n| `store` | `store` |\n| `payment_method` | `payment_method` |\n| `shipping_method` | `shipping_method` |\n| `shipping_address` | `shipping_address` |\n| `billing_address` | `billing_address` |\n| `coupon_code` | `coupon_code` |\n| `custom_fields` | `properties` |\n| **`products`** | `lineitems` |\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> `shipping_address` and `billing_address` should be an object.\n\nNote that **`products`** is an array of objects. Every object in this array can contain the following fields:\n\n| **RudderStack Field** | **Ometria Field** |\n| --- | --- |\n| `product_id` | `product_id` |\n| `variant_id` | `variant_id` |\n| `quantity` | `quantity` |\n| `sku` | `sku` |\n| `unit_price` | `unit_price` |\n| `quantity_refunded` | `quantity_refunded` |\n| `refunded` | `refunded` |\n| `subtotal` | `subtotal` |\n| `tax` | `tax` |\n| `total` | `total` |\n| `discount` | `discount` |\n| `is_on_sale` | `is_on_sale` |\n| `totals` | `totals` |\n| `properties` | `properties` |\n| **`variant_options`** | **`variant_options`** |\n\nNote that **`variant_options`** listed above is an array of objects. It is not a mandatory field. However, if provided, each object in this array **must** contain the following fields:\n\n| **RudderStack Field** | **Ometria Field** |\n| --- | --- |\n| `id` | `id` |\n| `type` | `type` |\n| `label` | `label` |\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### How do I get the Ometria API Key?\n\nTo get the Ometria API token, go to your your Ometria dashboard and navigate to **Settings** - **API Keys**. Then, click **New API Key**.\n\nQuestions? Contact us by [email](mailto:docs@rudderstack.com) or on [Slack](https://rudderstack.com/join-rudderstack-slack-community)",

    "markdown": "# Optimizely Web Experimentation | RudderStack Docs\n\nSend your event data from RudderStack to Optimizely Web.\n\n* * *\n\n*     5 minute read  \n    \n\n[Optimizely Web Experimentation](https://www.optimizely.com/platform/experimentation/) (formerly Optimizely Web) lets you you test and experiment new features on your website. It is typically used by marketing teams and product managers to learn more about the customers’ product journey, and test new features to boost conversion rates and overall customer engagement.\n\n## Getting started\n\nRudderStack supports sending event data to Optimizely Web via the following [connection modes](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/):\n\n| **Connection Mode** | **Web** | **Mobile** | **Server** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Device mode** | **Supported** | **\\-** | **\\-** |\n| **Cloud mode** | **\\-** | **\\-** | **\\-** |\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Based on your website’s content security policy, you might need to [allowlist the domain](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/load-js-sdk/#allowlist-destination-domain) from where you are loading the Optimizely Web SDK.\n\nOnce you have confirmed that the source platform supports sending events to Optimizely Web Experimentation, follow these steps:\n\n1.  Define [custom events in the Optimizely Dashboard](https://help.optimizely.com/Build_Campaigns_and_Experiments/Custom_events_in_Optimizely_X) and add those events as metrics in the corresponding experiments.\n2.  Add the Optimizely Web Experimentation snippet to your web page immediately after the opening `<head>` tag. Then, include the RudderStack JavaScript snippet.\n3.  From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add the source. Then, from the list of destinations, select **Optimizely Web**.\n4.  Assign a name to your destination and click **Continue**.\n\n## Connection settings\n\nTo successfully configure Optimizely Web Experimentation as a destination, you will need to configure the following settings:\n\n*   **Send experiment data to other tools:** By enabling this setting, you can send your experiment or campaign data to other destinations connected to the same source.\n    *   **As a track call**: When this setting is enabled, an `Experiment Viewed` `track` event will be sent to RudderStack along with other configured destinations for each active experiments per page load. The `properties` of this event will be Optimizely’s experiment metadata.\n    *   **As identify call:** When this setting is enabled, an `identify` call will be sent to RudderStack and other configured destinations, with the traits as `experiment name` and `variation name` .\n*   **Send experiment viewed event as non-interaction event**: In case you want to send the `Experiment Viewed` track event to Google Analytics, enable this setting. The `track`event will then be sent to Google Analytics as a non-interaction event, i.e. an additional property `nonInteraction` with value `1` will be appended to the properties of that event.\n*   **Revenue on Order Completed event:** Enabling this setting will send `revenue` as a property of the `track`only for the events with event name `Order Completed`.\n*   **Track categorized pages:** Enabling this setting will send `page` calls to Optimizely Web having `category` as `track` events.\n*   **Track named pages:** Enabling this will send `page` calls having `name` as `track` events to Optimizely Web.\n*   **Custom campaign properties:** In this section, provide the mapping of the campaign metadata to the RudderStack `track` event properties for the `Experiment Viewed` event. Please note that the `event property` should be the `track` event property and the `campaign property` should be the corresponding metadata of the campaign.\n*   **Client-side Events Filtering**: This setting lets you specify which events should be blocked or allowed to flow through to Optimizely Web Experimentation. For more information on this setting, refer to the [Client-side Events Filtering](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/event-filtering/) guide.\n*   **Use device mode to send events**: As this is a [web device mode](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#device-mode)\\-only destination, this setting is enabled by default and cannot be disabled.\n*   **OneTrust Cookie Categories**: This setting lets you associate [OneTrust](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/data-governance/consent-management/onetrust/javascript/) cookie consent groups to Optimizely.\n\n## Page\n\nIf you have enabled the **Track Categorized Pages** or **Track Named Pages** dashboarding setting, then RudderStack sends a `page` call having a name or category as a `track` event with the event name as `Viewed ${category} page` or `Viewed ${name} page` to Optimizely.\n\nA sample `page` call is shown below:\n\n```\n// \"home\" is the name of the page.\nrudderanalytics.page(\"home\");\n```\n\n## Track\n\nRudderStack sends a `track` call to Optimizely with a valid event name associated with an active experiment.\n\nIf you have enabled the **Revenue on Order Completed event** dashboard setting, then RudderStack sends the `revenue` property only for the `Order Completed` event and not for any other event.\n\nRudderStack converts the value of `revenue` to cents before passing it to Optimizely. Thus, $5 will be converted to 500 cents.\n\nIf **Revenue on Order Completed event** is disabled in the dashboard, then the property is passed as is, without any conversion.\n\nA sample `track` call is as shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"Order Completed\", {\n  revenue: 30,\n  value: 30.0,\n})\n```\n\n## Sending experiment data\n\nIf the **Send experiment data as track call** dashboard setting is enabled while configuring the destination, RudderStack automatically records and sends a web experiment as a `track` event with `Experiment Viewed` as the event name and the experiment metadata as the event properties.\n\nYou can then send this `track` event to the other destinations (connected to the same source in RudderStack) to analyze the experimentation results.\n\nThis `track` event call consists of the following properties:\n\n*   `campaignName`\n*   `campaignId`\n*   `experimentId`\n*   `experimentName`\n*   `variationName`\n*   `variationId`\n*   `audienceId`\n*   `audienceName`\n*   `nonInteraction`\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> If you provide the **custom campaign properties** in the destination settings, then the campaign metadata key will be overridden by the corresponding event properties.\n\nA sample `track` call is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"Experiment Viewed\", {\n  campaignName: \"test campaign\",\n  campaignId: \"1234567890\",\n  experimentId: \"0123456789\",\n  experimentName: \"test experiment\",\n  variationId: \"1122334455\",\n  variationName: \"test variation\",\n  audienceId: \"1212121212\",\n  audienceName: \"sample audience\",\n  nonInteraction: 1,\n})\n```\n\nIf the **Send experiment data as identify call** dashboard setting is enabled, RudderStack sends an `identify` event with the following traits for each active experiment:\n\n*   `experimentName`\n*   `variationName`\n\nYou can then send this `identify` event to the other destinations (connected to the same source in RudderStack) to analyze the experimentation results.\n\nNote that:\n\n*   In case multiple experiments are active, then multiple `identify` events are triggered.\n*   RudderStack persists the `identify` traits for the subsequent `identify` calls, that is, the `identify` calls contain the previous `identify` traits as well.\n\nA sample `identify` call is as shown:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify({\n    `Experiment: ${experimentName}` : variationName\n});\n```\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### Do I need to add Optimizely Web’s JavaScript snippet to my website?\n\nYes. You need to add the Optimizely Web snippet immediately after the opening `<head>` tag of your web page. Then, include the JavaScript snippet of RudderStack.\n\n#### Why I am not able to see the events in my experiments?\n\nDefine the `custom events` in Optimizely Web’s dashboard and add those events as `metrics` in corresponding Optimizely ’s `experiment`.\n\nWhile defining the custom event, you need to provide an `API Name` and while using RudderStack’s `track` API, use this `API name` as the `event name`.\n\nQuestions?

In your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), go to **Directory** > **Destinations** > **Cloud Destinations** and search for **Ortto**.\n2.  Connect your source and click **Continue**.\n\n### Connection settings\n\nConfigure the following settings to set up Ortto as a destination in RudderStack:\n\n*   **Name**: Assign a name to uniquely identify the destination.\n*   **Private API Key**: Enter your private API key from the Ortto data source. For more information on generating this key, see [Ortto’s documentation](https://help.ortto.com/user/latest/data-sources/configuring-a-new-data-source/other-integrations/custom-api.html#create-your-custom-api-key).\n*   **Instance Region**: Specify your Ortto account’s instance region from **Australia**, **Europe**, or **Other**.\n\n### Connection mode\n\nSpecify how you want to route events from your source to Ortto.\n\nRudderStack supports sending events to Ortto via the following [connection modes](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/):\n\n| Connection Mode | Web | Mobile | Server |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Device mode** | \\-  | \\-  | \\-  |\n| **Cloud mode** | **Supported** | **Supported** | **Supported** |\n\n### Configuration settings\n\nAfter completing the initial setup, configure the following settings to correctly receive your data in Ortto:\n\n*   **OneTrust cookie consent settings**: This setting lets you associate the [OneTrust](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/data-governance/consent-management/onetrust/) cookie consent groups to Ortto.\n\n### Event and property mapping\n\nClick the **Set up mapping** button to map your RudderStack events and properties to specific Ortto custom events/properties. You can also use the JSON mapper to set these mappings.\n\nRudderStack provides the following options:\n\n*   **Event and property mappings**: Map a RudderStack event or property to an Ortto event/property. In the property mappings, you can also specify the **Ortto Property Type**.\n\n[![Ortto event mapping](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/ortto-event-mapping.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/ortto-event-mapping.webp)\n\n*   **Custom user traits mappings**: Use this setting to map the user traits in your `identify` events to your [Ortto Person](https://help.ortto.com/developer/latest/api-reference/person/index.html) attributes.\n\n[![Ortto traits mapping](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/ortto-trait-mapping.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/ortto-trait-mapping.webp)\n\n## Identify\n\nYou can use the [`identify`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/identify/) call to create or update an user in Ortto. RudderStack sends this data to Ortto by leveraging their [`merge`](https://help.ortto.com/developer/latest/api-reference/person/merge.html) endpoint.\n\nA sample `identify` event is shown:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify(\"1hKOmRA4GRlm\", {\n  \"firstName\": \"Alex\",\n  \"lastName\": \"Keener\",\n  \"email\": \"alex@example.com\",\n  \"phone\": \"+1-202-555-0146\",\n  \"emailConsent\": true,\n  \"smsConsent\": false,\n  \"gdpr\": false,\n  \"address\": {\n    \"city\": \"New Orleans\",\n    \"country\": \"USA\",\n    \"zipcode\": 900001\n  }\n});\n```\n\nNote that:\n\n*   `userId` or `anonymousId` are required fields in your `identify` calls for RudderStack to send data to Ortto successfully.\n*   RudderStack uses `userId`/`anonymousId` to look up the user and update their profile in Ortto. If these fields are absent, it uses `email` instead.\n*   Use the `emailConsent`, `smsConsent`, and `gdpr` fields to set consent for email subscription, SMS subscription, and GDPR, respectively.\n\n## Track\n\nYou can use the [`track`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/track/) to record user activities in Ortto. RudderStack sends this data to Ortto by leveraging their [`activities`](https://help.ortto.com/a-270-activities) API. The event mapping is shown below:\n\n| RudderStack event | Ortto event |\n| --- | --- |\n| `event`  <br>Required | `activities[i].activity_id` |\n\nA sample `track` payload is as shown in the snippet below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"Product Clicked\", {\n  description: \"Adidas Sneakers\",\n  brand: \"Adidas\",\n  colors: \"red\",\n  productName: \"Shoes\"\n}, {\n  context: {\n    traits: {\n      emailConsent: false,\n      smsConsent: true,\n      gdpr: true\n    }\n  }\n});\n```\n\nAs seen in the above snippet, you can use the `emailConsent`, `smsConsent`, and `gdpr` fields within the `context.traits` object to set consent for email subscription, SMS subscription, and GDPR, respectively.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> Make sure the events you want to send to Ortto are specified and mapped to the Ortto events in the [Event and property mappings](#event-and-property-mapping) dashboard setting. Otherwise, RudderStack will drop them.\n\n## Supported mappings\n\nRudderStack maps the following `identify`/`track` event properties to the corresponding Ortto properties:\n\n| RudderStack property | Ortto property |\n| --- | --- |\n| `userId`  <br>`anonymousId`  <br>Required | `str::ei` |\n| `context.traits.firstName` | `people[i].fields.str::first` |\n| `context.traits.lastName` | `people[i].fields.str::last` |\n| `context.traits.email` | `people[i].fields.str::email` |\n| `context.traits.address.city` | `people[i].fields.geo::city.name` |\n| `context.traits.address.country` | `people[i].fields.geo::country.name` |\n| `context.traits.address.region` | `people[i].fields.geo::region.name` |\n| `context.traits.address.zipcode` | `people[i].fields.str::postal` |\n| `context.traits.birthday` | `people[i].fields.dtz::b` |\n| `context.traits.language`  <br>`context.locale` | `str::language` |\n| `context.traits.phone` | `phn::phone.n` |\n| `userId`  <br>`anonymousId` | `str::ei` |\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack supports sending up to 100 fields in a single request.\n\nQuestions?

You will have to implement some Optimizely functions natively to make sure the experiment logic runs correctly.\n\nFollow these steps to add Optimizely Feature Experimentation to your Android Project:\n\n1.  Add the following `repository` to your `app/build.gradle` file.\n\n```\nrepositories {\n    mavenCentral()\n}\n```\n\n2.  After that, add the following `dependency` in the same file:\n\n```\nimplementation 'com.rudderstack.android.integration:optimizely:0.1.1'\nimplementation 'com.optimizely.ab:android-sdk:3.0.0'\n```\n\n3.  Initialize the Optimizely Manager:\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> Optimizely recommends initializing their SDK as soon as possible. You need to initialize the Optimizely Manager before proceeding to the next step. Refer to the Optimizely [Initializing the SDK](https://docs.developers.optimizely.com/full-stack/docs/initialize-sdk-android) guide for more information.\n\n```\nval optimizelyManager =  OptimizelyManager.builder()\n            .withSDKKey(<YOUR OPTIMIZELY SDK KEY>)\n            .build(this)\n```\n\n4.  Finally, change the initialization of your `RudderClient` in your `Application` class:\n\n```\nval rudderClient = RudderClient.getInstance(\n    this,\n    <YOUT_WRITE_KEY>,\n    RudderConfig.Builder()\n        .withEndPointUri(<YOUR_DATA_PLANE_URL>)\n        .withFactory(OptimizelyIntegrationFactory.FACTORY(optimizelyManager)\n        .build()\n)\n```\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> Make sure you pass the Optimizely manager instance you created in the previous step to the factory as shown in the above snippet above.\n\nFollow these steps to add Optimizely Feature Experimentation to your iOS project:\n\n1.  Go your `Podfile` and add the `Rudder-Optimizely` extension:\n\n2.  After adding the dependency followed by `pod install`, you can add the imports to your `AppDelegate.m` file as shown:\n\n```\n#import \"RudderOptimizelyFactory.h\"\n```\n\n3.  Finally, change the initialization of your `RudderClient` as shown:\n\n```\nRSConfigBuilder *builder = [[RSConfigBuilder alloc] init];\n[builder withDataPlaneUrl:DATA_PLANE_URL];\n// Setup optimizely logger.\nOPTLYLoggerDefault *optlyLogger = [[OPTLYLoggerDefault alloc] initWithLogLevel:OptimizelyLogLevelAll];\n// Create an Optimizely manager\n self.optlyManager = [[OPTLYManager alloc] initWithBuilder:[OPTLYManagerBuilder  builderWithBlock:^(OPTLYManagerBuilder * _Nullable builder) {\n        builder.sdkKey = @<SDK KEY>;\n        builder.logger = optlyLogger;\n }]];\n[builder withFactory:[RudderOptimizelyFactory instanceWithOptimizely:self.optlyManager]];\n[builder withLoglevel:RSLogLevelDebug];\n[RSClient getInstance:WRITE_KEY config:[builder build]];\n```",

Then, from the list of destinations, select **Pardot**.\n\n## Connection settings\n\nTo successfully configure Pardot as a destination, first authenticate your account by following the below steps:\n\n1.  Click **Create Account** in the **Account Settings** section.\n2.  From the modal, click the **Sign in with Google** button.\n3.  Choose the required account and grant RudderStack the required permissions.\n4.  Click **Save** to use the specified account:\n\n[![Google Account authentication](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/account-connect-normal.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/account-connect-normal.webp)\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> In case you have authenticated multiple accounts, you can click **Edit Credentials** to select or delete any other authenticated account:\n> \n> ![Google Account authentication](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/edit-account-creds.webp)\n> \n> RudderStack **gives an error** if you try to delete an account used by any other connection set up for the same destination.\n\nNext, configure the following settings:\n\n[![Pardot connection settings](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/pardot-connection-settings3.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/pardot-connection-settings3.webp)\n\n*   **Business Unit Id**: Your **Business Unit ID** is the 18 character long string starting with `0Uv`. You can find it in your **Salesforce** account by following the steps listed below:\n    1.  Go to **Setup** at the top right corner and click **Pardot**.\n    2.  Click **Pardot Account Setup** to obtain the Business Unit ID.\n\n[![Pardot Business Unit Id](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/pardot-business-unit-id.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/pardot-business-unit-id.webp)\n\n*   **Campaign Id**: You can find the Campaign ID (or piCId) under **Marketing** > **Campaigns** in your Pardot account. After selecting the desired website campaign, click **View Tracking Code**.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Alternatively, you can go to the [Pardot campaigns](https://pi.pardot.com/campaign) and select the desired campaign from the list. The last 5 digits of the campaign URL is your campaign ID. For example, `12345` is the campaign ID for the campaign URL `https://pi.pardot.com/campaign/read/id/12345` .\n\n## Identify\n\nThe `identify` call lets you capture the details of a visiting user along with any associated traits such as their name, email address, etc.\n\nA sample `identify` call is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify(\"userId\", {\n  \"active_seats\": 6,\n  \"salutation\": \"Mr\",\n  \"firstName\": \"Alex\",\n  \"lastName\": \"Keener\",\n  \"email\": \"alex@example.com\",\n  \"website\": \"https://www.example.com\",\n  \"score\": 16,\n  \"company\": \"Example Organization\",\n  \"job_title\": \"Sales Executive\",\n  \"department\": \"Sales\",\n  \"country\": \"USA\",\n  \"address\": {\n    \"street\": \"6649 N Blue Gum Street\",\n    \"city\": \"New Orleans\",\n    \"state\": \"LA\",\n    \"zip\": \"00000\"\n  },\n  \"phone\": \"8005550100\",\n  \"annual_revenue\": \"100000\",\n  \"employees\": \"100\",\n  \"industry\": \"Technology sector\",\n  \"notes\": \"example notes\",\n  \"address_two\": \"example address\",\n  \"fax\": \"fax321\",\n  \"years_in_business\": 13,\n  \"comments\": \"good\",\n  \"is_do_not_email\": false,\n  \"opted_out\": false,\n  \"is_reviewed\": false,\n  \"is_starred\": true,\n  \"territory\": \"territory\",\n  \"campaign_id\": 12345\n}, {\n  externalId: [{\n    type: \"crmfid\", // can be pardotid for sending pardot ID\n    id: \"crmFidUser\",\n  }]\n});\n```\n\nThe following behavior can be observed whenever an `identify` call is made through RudderStack:\n\n*   RudderStack throws an error if either `email` or `externalId` (`crmfid`/`pardotid`) is absent.\n*   RudderStack calls the update API if `email` is absent but either `pardotid` or `crmfid` is present. However, if `pardotid` and `crmfid` are not already linked to a prospect, it throws an error.\n*   RudderStack throws an error if `email` is absent and `prospectid` or `crmfid` is entered incorrectly.\n*   If only `email` is present, or Pardot already contains more than one prospect with the same email ID, a new prospect is created as Pardot does not allow write operation on email IDs.\n*   RudderStack considers only the first `externalId` in case of multiple `externalId`.\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### How do I find the crmfid (used for upsert operation)?\n\nYou can find the `crmfid` (CRM Lead ID) under any **Prospect** by clicking on **Sync with CRM** as shown below:\n\n[![Pardot CRM Lead ID](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/Pardot-crmfid1.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/Pardot-crmfid1.webp)\n\nThe CRM Lead ID can be located here:\n\n[![Pardot CRM Lead ID](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/Pardot-crmfid2.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/Pardot-crmfid2.webp)\n\n#### How do I update the prospect data?\n\nTo update the prospect data, you need to send a payload that contains `externalId` in the payload as shown below:\n\n```\n// Sample payload with `id` data for update\n{\n  \"externalId\": [{\n    \"type\": \"pardotid\"\n    \"id\": \"12345\",\n  }]\n}\n```\n\n*   `type` can contain either of the following fields:\n    *   Pardot ID with field name as `pardotid`.\n    *   CRM FID with field name as `crmfid`.\n*   `id` field contains the actual value.\n\n#### Can I send the event data to Pardot’s Sandbox environment?\n\nUnfortunately, you can currently send the event data only to the Pardot’s **production** environment. Sandbox environments are not supported.\n\nQuestions? Contact us by [email](mailto:docs@rudderstack.com) or on [Slack](https://rudderstack.com/join-rudderstack-slack-community)",

You will see an option called **Apps** and under that hover on the square box and click **view app details**.\n> 4.  Here you will find your **API Key** in **App Details** section.\n\n## Identify\n\nTo identify a user to Pendo, you need to call the `identify` API. When you send an `identify` call, RudderStack will pass that user’s information to Pendo with `userId` as Pendo’s visitor ID. The user traits that you pass are mapped to visitor metadata in Pendo.\n\nA sample `identify` call is as shown:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify(\"name123\", {\n  name: \"Name Surname\",\n  first_name: \"Name\",\n  last_name: \"Surname\",\n  email: \"name@surname.com\",\n  createdAt: \"Thu Mar 24 2020 17:46:45 GMT+0000 (UTC)\",\n})\n```\n\n## Group\n\nYou can use the `group` call to create or update an account in Pendo. When you send a Group call, RudderStack sends the `groupId` to Pendo as account ID. The group traits are mapped to account metadata in Pendo.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> If you are using your Pendo account data, the group calls (with fields `groupId` & `traits`) are required.\n\nHere is a sample `group` call:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.group(\"groupId\", {\n    \"name\": \"Company\",\n    \"industry\": \"Industry\",\n    \"employees\": 123,\n    \"email\": abc@xyz.com\n  }\n);\n```\n\n## Track\n\nThe `track` call allows you to capture any action that the user might perform, along with the properties that are associated with that action. Each action is considered to be an event.\n\nHere is a sample `track` call:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"test track event\", {\n  revenue: 30,\n  currency: \"USD\",\n  userId: \"12345\",\n})\n```\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### Where do I find the Pendo API Key?\n\n*   Login to Pendo dashboard.\n*   Go to the **Settings** on the left sidebar and click **Subscription Settings.**\n*   You will see an option called **Apps** and under that hover on the square box and click **view app details**.\n*   Here you will find your **API Key** in **App Details** section.\n\nQuestions?

    "markdown": "# PersistIQ | RudderStack Docs\n\nSend your event data from RudderStack to PersistIQ.\n\n* * *\n\n*     4 minute read  \n    \n\n[PersistIQ](https://www.persistiq.com/) is an outbound sales automation and customer discovery platform. It helps you find new customers, onboard them, and organize your outreach strategies effectively.\n\n## Getting started\n\nRudderStack supports sending event data to PersistIQ via the following [connection modes](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/):\n\n| Connection Mode | Web | Mobile | Server |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Device mode | \\-  | \\-  | \\-  |\n| Cloud mode | Supported | Supported | Supported |\n\nOnce you have confirmed that the source platform supports sending events to PersistIQ, follow these steps:\n\n1.  From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add a source. Then, from the list of destinations, select **PersistIQ**.\n2.  Assign a name to the destination and click **Continue**.\n\n## Connection settings\n\nTo successfully configure PersistIQ as a destination, you will need to configure the following settings:\n\n*   **PersistIQ REST API Key**: Enter your PersistIQ API key. For more information on obtaining the API key, refer to the [FAQ](#faq) section below.\n*   **Map RudderStack user attributes to PersistIQ Lead attributes**: Use this setting to map your RudderStack event properties to the custom or non-standard PersistIQ lead attributes.\n\n## Identify\n\nYou can use RudderStack’s [`identify`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/identify/) call to create or update a lead (prospect) in PersistIQ. RudderStack sends the user information to PersistIQ via their `/leads` endpoint.\n\n### Creating a new lead\n\nA sample `identify` call that creates a new lead in PersistIQ is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify(\"1hKOmRA4GRlm\", {\n  name: \"Alex Keener\",\n  address: \"99 Blue Gum Street\",\n  email: \"alex@example.com\"\n})\n```\n\nRudderStack automatically maps all common attributes like name, email, city, etc. to the PersistIQ lead attributes. To map specific event properties to the custom PersistIQ lead attributes, use the **Map RudderStack user attributes to PersistIQ Lead attributes** dashboard setting to specify the mapping.\n\n#### Supported mappings\n\nThe following table lists the mappings between the RudderStack properties and PersistIQ attributes:\n\n| RudderStack property | PersistIQ property | Data type |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `traits.dup` | `dup` | String |\n| `traits.creator_id` | `creator_id` | String |\n| `context.traits.email`  <br>`traits.email` | `lead[0].email` | String |\n| `context.traits.country`  <br>`traits.country` | `lead[0].country` | String |\n| `context.traits.city`  <br>`traits.city` | `lead[0].city` | String |\n| `context.traits.gender`  <br>`traits.gender` | `lead[0].gender` | String |\n| `context.traits.company`  <br>`traits.company` | `lead[0].company_name` | String |\n| `context.traits.phone`  <br>`traits.phone` | `lead[0].phone` | Phone number |\n| `context.traits.facebookUrl`  <br>`traits.facebookUrl` | `lead[0].facebookUrl` | URL |\n| `context.traits.twitterUrl`  <br>`traits.twitterUrl` | `lead[0].twitterUrl` | URL |\n| `context.traits.linkedinUrl`  <br>`traits.linkedinUrl` | `lead[0].linkedinUrl` | URL |\n| `traits.firstName`  <br>`traits.firstname`  <br>`traits.first_name`  <br>`context.traits.firstName`  <br>`context.traits.firstname`  <br>`context.traits.first_name` | `lead[0].first_name` | String |\n| `traits.lastName`  <br>`traits.lastname`  <br>`traits.last_name`  <br>`context.traits.lastName`  <br>`context.traits.lastname`  <br>`context.traits.last_name` | `lead[0].last_name` | String |\n| `traits.{x}`  <br>`context.traits.{x}` | `lead[0].{x}` | \\-  |\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack does not batch events before sending them to PersistIQ. Hence, the index inside the `lead` array is always `0`.\n\n### Updating an existing lead\n\nRudderStack automatically updates a lead if the `identify` call contains the `persistIqLeadId` field in the `externalId` object. Otherwise, it creates a new lead.\n\nA sample `identify` call that updates an existing PersistIQ lead is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify(\"1hKOmRA4GRlm\", {\n  name: \"Alex Keener\",\n  address: \"99 Blue Gum Street\",\n  email: \"alex@example.com\"\n}, {\n  \"externalId\": [{\n    \"type\": \"persistIqLeadId\",\n    \"id\": \"abc12345\"\n  }]\n})\n```\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> For more information on getting your PersistIQ lead ID, refer to the [FAQ](#faq) section below.\n\n#### Supported mappings\n\nThe following table list the mappings between the RudderStack properties and PersistIQ attributes:\n\n| RudderStack property | PersistIQ property | Data type |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `externalId.persistIqLeadId`  <br>Required | `leadId` | String |\n| `traits.status`  <br>`context.traits.status` | `status` | String |\n| `context.traits.email`  <br>`traits.email` | `data.email` | String |\n| `context.traits.country`  <br>`traits.country` | `data.country` | String |\n| `context.traits.city`  <br>`traits.city` | `data.city` | String |\n| `context.traits.gender`  <br>`traits.gender` | `data.gender` | String |\n| `context.traits.company`  <br>`traits.company` | `data.company_name` | String |\n| `context.traits.phone`  <br>`traits.phone` | `data.phone` | String |\n| `context.traits.facebookUrl`  <br>`traits.facebookUrl` | `data.facebookUrl` | URL |\n| `context.traits.twitterUrl`  <br>`traits.twitterUrl` | `data.twitterUrl` | URL |\n| `context.traits.linkedinUrl`  <br>`traits.linkedinUrl` | `data.linkedinUrl` | URL |\n| `traits.firstName`  <br>`traits.firstname`  <br>`traits.first_name`  <br>`context.traits.firstName`  <br>`context.traits.firstname`  <br>`context.traits.first_name` | `data.first_name` | String |\n| `traits.lastName`  <br>`traits.lastname`  <br>`traits.last_name`  <br>`context.traits.lastName`  <br>`context.traits.lastname`  <br>`context.traits.last_name` | `data.last_name` | String |\n| `traits.{x}`  <br>`context.traits.{x}` | `data.{x}` | \\-  |\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> The lead status passed in the `traits.status`/`context.traits.status` must already be configured in your PersistIQ dashboard.\n\n## Group\n\nYou can use the [`group`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/group/) events to add or remove a lead from a group in PersistIQ. RudderStack uses the `/campaigns` endpoint to send this information to PersistIQ.\n\nA sample `group` call is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.group(\"group01\", {\n  mailbox_id: \"mbid123\",\n  operation: \"add\" // set to remove to remove user from a group\n}, {\n  \"externalId\": [{\n    \"type\": \"persistIqLeadId\",\n    \"id\": \"abc12345\"\n  }]\n})\n```\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> If not explicitly specified, RudderStack automatically sets the `traits.operation` parameter to `add`. To remove a user from the group, set this parameter to `remove`.\n\n### Supported mappings\n\nThe following table list the mappings between the RudderStack properties and PersistIQ attributes:\n\n| RudderStack property | PersistIQ property |\n| --- | --- |\n| `groupId`  <br>Required | `campaign_id` |\n| `externalId.persistIqLeadId`  <br>Required | `leadId` |\n| `traits.mailbox_id`  <br>`context.traits.mailbox_id` | `mailbox_id` |\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### Where can I find the PersistIQ API key?\n\nTo get your PersistIQ API key, follow these steps:\n\n1.  Log in to your [PersistIQ dashboard](https://persistiq.com/app/).\n2.  From the bottom left corner, click your profile button and go to **Settings and Billing** > **Integrations**. Your API key will be listed here:\n\n[![PersistIQ API Key](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/persistiq-api-key.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/persistiq-api-key.webp)\n\n#### How do I get the PersistIQ lead ID and campaign ID?\n\nTo get a prospect’s lead ID in the [PersistIQ dashboard](https://persistiq.com/app/), click the specific prospect. You can find the ID in the resulting URL:\n\n[![PersistIQ lead ID](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/persistiq-lead-id.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/persistiq-lead-id.webp)\n\nSimilarly, to get a campaign ID, go to **Campaigns** in your dashboard and click the required campaign. The ID should be visible in the resulting URL.\n\n[![PersistIQ campaign ID](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/persistiq-campaign-id.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/persistiq-campaign-id.webp)\n\nQuestions?

    "markdown": "# Qualtrics | RudderStack Docs\n\nSend your event data from RudderStack to Qualtrics.\n\n* * *\n\n*     7 minute read  \n    \n\n[Qualtrics](https://www.qualtrics.com/au/core-xm/survey-software/) is a popular survey software that lets you create intelligent, real-time user surveys. It lets you get cutting-edge insights into your customers and use them to boost your brand value.\n\nRudderStack lets you configure Qualtrics as a destination to which you can send your event data directly.\n\n## Getting started\n\nRudderStack supports sending event data to Qualtrics via the following [connection modes](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/):\n\n| Connection Mode | Web | Mobile | Server |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Device mode** | **Supported** | **Supported** | \\-  |\n| **Cloud mode** | \\-  | \\-  | \\-  |\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> In a web device mode integration, that is, using [JavaScript SDK](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/) as a source, the Qualtrics native SDK is loaded from `http://qualtrics.com` domain. Based on your website’s content security policy, you might need to [allowlist this domain](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/load-js-sdk/#allowlist-destination-domain) to load the Qualtrics SDK successfully.\n\nOnce you have confirmed that the source platform supports sending events to Qualtrics, follow these steps:\n\n1.  From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add the source and select **Qualtrics** from the list of destinations.\n2.  Assign a name to the destination and click **Continue**.\n\n### Configuration Settings\n\nTo successfully configure Qualtrics as a destination, you will need to configure the following settings:\n\n*   **Project ID:** Enter your Qualtrics Project ID here.\n*   **Brand ID:** Enter your Qualtrics Brand ID here.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Refer to the [FAQ](#faq) section below for steps on obtaining your Qualtrics Project ID and Brand ID.\n\n*   **Enable Generic Page Title:** If this field is enabled, RudderStack sends every `page` call with the name `Viewed a Page`.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> This field is useful only when using the `page` call.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> If this option is disabled, RudderStack will search for the category and name of the `page` call and send the event as `Viewed <category_field> <name_field> Page`. If any of the two fields is absent, RudderStack sends the `page` call as `Viewed <category_field> / <name_field> Page`.\n\n## Adding device mode integration\n\nTo add Qualtrics to your iOS project, follow these steps:\n\n1.  In your `Podfile`, add the `Rudder-Qualtrics` extension as shown:\n\n2.  After adding the dependency followed by a `pod install` command, add the following imports to your `AppDelegate.m` file:\n\n```\n#import <rudder>\n#import <rudderqualtricsfactory.h>\n@import Qualtrics;\n```\n\n3.  Then, add the initialization of your `RSClient` as shown:\n\n```\nRSConfigBuilder *configBuilder = [[RSConfigBuilder alloc] init];\n    [configBuilder withDataPlaneUrl:DATA_PLANE_URL];\n    [configBuilder withFactory:[RudderQualtricsFactory instance]];\n    [RSClient getInstance:<source_write_key> config:[configBuilder build]];\n```\n\n4.  Next, add the following snippet to display the qualified intercept on your `ViewController`:\n\n```\n[Qualtrics.shared evaluateProjectWithCompletion:^(NSDictionary<nsstring>* targetingResults){\n    for (NSString* interceptID in targetingResults) {\n      TargetingResult *result = targetingResults[interceptID];\n          if ([result passed]) {\n            [[Qualtrics shared] displayWithViewController:self];\n          }\n    }\n}];\n```\n\nFor more information, refer to the [Qualtrics iOS documentation](https://api.qualtrics.com/2241421657525-getting-started-with-the-mobile-app-sdk-on-i-os).\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Your Android project must be on **version 5.0 (API level 21) or higher** for RudderStack to be able to send events to Qualtrics.\n\nOnce confirmed, follow these steps to add Qualtrics to your Android project:\n\n1.  Open your `app/build.gradle` (Module: app) file and add the following under the `dependencies` section :\n\n```\nimplementation 'com.rudderstack.android.sdk:core:1.+'\nimplementation 'com.rudderstack.android.integration:qualtrics:1.0.0'\nimplementation 'com.google.code.gson:gson:2.8.6'\n\n// Qualtrics\nimplementation 'com.qualtrics:digital:2.0.0'\n```\n\n2.  Add a new Maven repository for the App Feedback package. Your `allprojects` section should appear as shown:\n\n```\nallprojects {\n    repositories {\n        google()\n        jcenter()\n        maven {\n            url \"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/si-mobile-sdks/android/\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n3.  Open the `AndroidManifest.xml` file from the `src/main` folder in the project root and add the following XML snippet after the existing activity:\n\n```\n<activity android:name=\"com.qualtrics.digital.QualtricsSurveyActivity\"></activity>\n<activity android:name=\"com.qualtrics.digital.QualtricsPopOverActivity\" android:theme=\"@style/Qualtrics.Theme.Transparent\"></activity>\n```\n\n4.  Initialize the RudderStack SDK in your `Application` class’ `onCreate()` method as shown:\n\n```\n// initialize Rudder SDK\nval rudderClient =\n    RudderClient.getInstance(\n        this,\n        WRITE_KEY,\n        RudderConfig.Builder()\n            .withDataPlaneUrl(DATA_PLANE_URL)\n            .withFactory(QualtricsIntegrationFactory.FACTORY)\n            .build()\n    )\n```\n\n5.  Add a `MyCallback` subclass. You need to implement a callback for the Qualtrics APIs. This will be used to call the `displayIntercept()` method based on the `evaluateIntercept()` result. A good place to add this callback is before the last closing brace (`}`) in your `MainActivity.Java` class. Add the following code:\n\n```\nprivate class MyCallback implements IQualtricsProjectEvaluationCallback {\n   @Override\n   public void run(Map<string targetingresult=\"\"> targetingResults) {\n       for (Map.Entry<string> result: targetingResults.entrySet())\n           if (result.getValue().passed()) {\n               Qualtrics.instance().displayIntercept(MainActivity.this, result.getKey());\n           }\n   }\n}\n```\n\n6.  Add the following snippet to display the qualified intercept in your activity class:\n\n```\nQualtrics.instance().evaluateProject(new MyCallback());\n```\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> In the iOS device mode implementation, even if the user qualifies for multiple intercepts, only one will be shown. Whereas in Android, all intercepts for the user will be shown.\n\n## Page\n\nThe `page` call lets you record your website’s page views with any additional relevant information about the viewed page.\n\nRudderStack passes any tracked events as embedded data to the Qualtrics [intercept](https://www.qualtrics.com/support/website-app-feedback/getting-started-with-website-app-feedback/step-4-setting-up-your-intercept/) target. After the `page` call, the Qualtrics survey is loaded.\n\n> ![success](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/tick.svg)\n> \n> You can set the intercepts when a user creates the project or after they have created the project.\n\nA sample `page` call is as shown:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.page(\"category\", \"name\", {\n  path: \"path\",\n  url: \"url\",\n  title: \"title\",\n  search: \"search\",\n  referrer: \"referrer\",\n  testDimension: \"true\"\n});\n```\n\nFor the above example, The event will be sent as `Viewed category name Page`, if the **Generic Page Title** option is disabled in the RudderStack dashboard. If this option is enabled, the event will be sent as `Viewed a Page`.\n\nIf the category field is not mentioned in the `page` call but specified inside the properties, RudderStack still includes the field while sending the event. For example, refer to the following snippet:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.page(\"name\", {\n  category: \"category\",\n  path: \"path\",\n  url: \"url\",\n  title: \"title\",\n  search: \"search\",\n  referrer: \"referrer\",\n  testDimension: \"true\"\n});\n```\n\nFor the above example, the event will be sent as `Viewed category name Page`, if the **Generic Page Title** option is disabled in the RudderStack dashboard. If it is enabled, the event will be sent as `Viewed a Page`.\n\nIf `category` is not specified in the event at all, RudderStack sends the event with only the page name, as shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.page(\"name\", {\n  path: \"path\",\n  url: \"url\",\n  title: \"title\",\n  search: \"search\",\n  referrer: \"referrer\",\n  testDimension: \"true\"\n});\n```\n\nFor the above example, The event will be sent as `Viewed name Page`, if the **Generic Page Title** option is disabled in the RudderStack dashboard.

Based on your website’s content security policy, you might need to [allowlist this domain](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/load-js-sdk/#allowlist-destination-domain) to load the Pinterest Tag SDK successfully.\n\nOnce you have confirmed that the source platform supports sending events to Pinterest Tag, follow these steps:\n\n1.  From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add a source. Then, from the list of destinations, select **Pinterest Tag**.\n2.  Assign a name to the destination and click **Continue**.\n\n## Connection settings\n\nTo successfully configure Pinterest Tag as a destination, configure the following settings:\n\n*   **Tag ID**: Enter your [Pinterest Tag ID](#how-do-i-get-the-pinterest-tag-id) (required only for sending events via [device mode](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#device-mode)).\n    \n*   **App Store App ID**: Enter the App Id from your App Store (required only for sending events using an iOS source).\n    \n*   **API Version**: Select the [Pinterest Tag API version](https://developers.pinterest.com/docs/getting-started/migration/) from the dropdown and enter the following values (required only for sending events via [cloud mode](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#cloud-mode)):\n    \n    **V3(deprecating soon)**:\n    \n    *   **Pinterest Advertiser ID**: Enter the Advertiser ID of your Pinterest account.\n    \n    **V5**:\n    \n    *   **Ad Account ID**: Enter your Pinterest’s [Ad Account ID](#how-do-i-get-the-ad-account-id).\n    *   **Conversion Token**: Enter the [Conversion Token](#how-to-get-the-conversion-token) associated with your Pinterest account.\n\n### Other settings\n\n*   **Send as test event**: RudderStack marks the event as test requests if this setting is turned on. It does not record the event but the API still returns the same response messages.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Use this setting to verify if your requests are working and the events are constructed correctly.\n\n*   **Enable hashing for user data conversions**: This setting is on by default and hashes your user data using SHA256 encoding.\n    \n*   **Enable Event Deduplication**: Turn on this setting to deduplicate the events. Then, specify the following:\n    \n    *   **Deduplication key**: Enter the key using which Pinterest Tag should use to deduplicate the events.\n*   **Enable Enhanced Match on Page Load**: This setting is on by default and attaches the hashed email address on the initial page load. Any further calls made to Pinterest will be an Enhanced Match.\n    \n    When turned off, all visits made to your site become anonymous. However, you can still identify any user by making the `identify()` call.\n    \n    RudderStack supports [Pinterest Enhanced Match](https://help.pinterest.com/en/business/article/enhanced-match) when the following conditions are met:\n    \n    *   A user is identified every time they visit your site.\n    *   A user visits your site anonymously but is identified at a later stage by making an `identify()` call.\n    \n    If you use RudderStack’s `identify()` method to use Pinterest’s Enhanced Match, you can only collect this information for successive events. Pinterest does not retroactively update the values for the past events.\n    \n*   **Send external\\_id for user**: Turn on this setting to send the user’s [`external_id`](https://developers.pinterest.com/docs/conversions/external-id/) to Pinterest Tag (applicable only for sending events via [cloud mode](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#cloud-mode)).\n    \n*   **Send as custom event**: Turn on this setting to send an unmapped event as a Pinterest custom event. If an event is neither mapped in the **Map Your Events To Pinterest Events** dashboard setting nor is one of the [ecommerce tracking events](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/pinterest-ads/pinterest-ads-cloud-mode/#ecommerce-conversion-tracking), it will be sent as a custom event.\n    \n*   **Custom Properties**: Enter any custom properties which should be sent to Pinterest (applicable only for sending events via [device mode](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#device-mode)).

    "markdown": "# Pinterest Tag device mode | RudderStack Docs\n\nSend events to Pinterest Tag via the web device mode.\n\n* * *\n\n*     4 minute read  \n    \n\nRudderStack lets you send your event data to Pinterest Tag using Pinterest’s `pintrk` conversion tag via [device mode](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#device-mode).\n\nFind the open source JavaScript SDK code for this destination in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-sdk-js/tree/production/src/integrations/PinterestTag).\n\n## Identify\n\nThe [`identify`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/identify/) call lets you create new or update existing customers and record the traits about them like their name, email address, etc.\n\nWhen you make an `identify` call with a user’s email address and traits, RudderStack triggers the Pinterest `set()` method. This saves the identification parameters to be sent with the next events, so it is recommended to set the values as early as possible.\n\nIf you make an `identify` call without `email`, the identification parameter will not be set.\n\nA sample `identify` call is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify(\"1hKOmRA4el9Zt1WSfVJIVo4GRlm\", {\n  name: \"Alex Keener\",\n  email: \"alex@example.com\",\n})\n```\n\nIn the above example, the identification parameter will be set to `alex@example.com` and the successive calls will be an Enhanced Match.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> After an `identify` call is made, nothing appears in the network tab in your browser or in the tag helper extension. However, a hashed value for an `em` parameter is added in the next event call, in a JSON object encoded in the URL.\n\n## Track\n\nThe [`track`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/track/) call allows you to capture user actions along with the properties associated with these actions.\n\nA sample `track` call is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"Order Completed\", {\n    checkout_id: \"C324532\",\n    order_id: \"T1230\",\n    value: 15.98,\n    revenue: 16.98,\n    currency: \"INR\"\n})\n```\n\nRudderStack SDK sends the `track` event and any properties as custom properties to Pinterest.\n\n### Ecommerce conversion tracking\n\nRudderStack supports ecommerce conversion tracking for Pinterest. You can use the [Ecommerce Events Specification](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/ecommerce-events-spec/) for sending the events while instrumenting your site with the RudderStack SDK.\n\nThe following table mentions some sample `track` events mapped to the Pinterest events:\n\n| RudderStack event | Pinterest event |\n| --- | --- |\n| Order Completed | `Checkout` |\n| Product Added | `AddToCart` |\n| Products Searched | `Search` |\n| Product List Filtered | `Search` |\n\nYou can also track a custom event that you want to include in the conversion reporting. It will be mapped to a custom Pinterest event, for example:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"custom event\")\n```\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> You can map your event to a specific Pinterest event by adding it in the **Map Your Events To Pinterest Events** section while configuring the Pinterest destination in RudderStack.\n\n### Standard Pinterest events\n\nPinterest supports the following nine standard events that can be mapped and tracked for reporting. Any event apart from these is treated as a user-defined event.\n\n*   `Checkout`\n*   `AddToCart`\n*   `PageVisit`\n*   `SignUp`\n*   `WatchVideo`\n*   `Lead`\n*   `Search`\n*   `ViewCategory`\n*   `Custom`\n\n### Property mapping\n\nRudderStack maps the following properties to the Pinterest properties:\n\n| RudderStack property | Pinterest property |\n| --- | --- |\n| query | `search_query` |\n| value | `value` |\n| order\\_quantity | `order_quantity` |\n| currency | `currency` |\n| order\\_id | `order_id` |\n| promo\\_code | `promo_code` |\n| property | `property` |\n| video\\_title | `video_title` |\n| lead\\_type | `lead_type` |\n| coupon | `coupon` |\n\nThe following properties are nested within the ecommerce `products` array:\n\n| RudderStack property | Pinterest property |\n| --- | --- |\n| product\\_id | `product_id` |\n| sku | `product_id` |\n| name | `product_name` |\n| price | `product_price` |\n| category | `product_category` |\n| variant | `product_variant` |\n| quantity | `product_quantity` |\n| brand | `product_brand` |\n\n### Custom properties\n\nYou can send the custom properties to Pinterest by adding them in the **Custom Properties** section while configuring the Pinterest destination in RudderStack.\n\nA sample snippet with custom properties is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"Event\", {\n  customProperty: {\n    customValue: 2,\n  },\n  someRandomMailId: \"user@gmail.com\",\n})\n```\n\nFor the above snippet, the following properties must be added in the **Custom Properties** section:\n\n*   `customProperty.customValue`\n*   `someRandomMailId`\n\n## Page\n\nThe [`page`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/page/) call lets you record your website’s page views with any additional relevant information about the viewed page.\n\nPinterest’s `pintrk` conversion tag sends any one of the following events when you make a `page` call:\n\n*   **`ViewCategory`**: RudderStack sends this event if both the `name` and `category` fields are present. The below sample event contains both the fields and is mapped to the Pinterest’s `ViewCategory` event:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.page(\"Best Seller\", \"Games\", {\n  path: \"/best-seller/games/1\",\n  url: \"https://www.estore.com/best-seller/games/1\",\n  title: \"Best selling games offered by EStore\",\n  search: \"estore bestseller games\",\n  referrer: \"https://www.google.com/search?q=estore+bestseller\",\n  testDimension: \"true\",\n})\n```\n\n*   **`PageVisit`**: RudderStack sends this event if only `name` field is present and drops any additional properties. The below sample event contains only `name` and is mapped to the Pinterest’s `PageVisit` event:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.page(\"Best Seller\", {\n  path: \"/best-seller/1\",\n})\n```\n\n## Limited Data Processing (LDP)\n\nStarting January 1, 2023, you can use Pinterest’s [Limited Data Processing (LDP)](https://developers.pinterest.com/docs/conversions/conversion-management/#Understanding%20Limited%20Data%20Processing) flag to limit how Pinterest uses certain data to help the advertisers comply with the users’ privacy settings in accordance with the CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act).\n\nThe following table lists the event properties **required to enable Limited Data Processing** and their mappings with the Pinterest fields:\n\n| RudderStack property | Pinterest property | Data type | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `context.traits.optOutType`  <br>`properties.optOutType` | `custom_data.opt_out_type` | String | Set this field to `LDP`. |\n| `context.traits.state`  <br>`context.traits.State`  <br>`context.traits.address.state`  <br>`context.traits.address.State` | `st` | Array of strings with SHA-256 encoding | Should be a two-letter code |\n| `context.traits.country`  <br>`context.traits.Country`  <br>`context.traits.address.country`  <br>`context.traits.address.Country` | `country` | Array of strings with SHA-256 encoding | Should be a two-character ISO-3166 country code |\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### How can I verify if my events are being sent to Pinterest Tag?\n\nFollow these steps to see your events in Pinterest Tag:\n\n1.  Login to your [Pinterest ads manager](https://ads.pinterest.com/) account.\n2.  Click the **Ads** tab and select **Conversions** from the dropdown to see your events:\n\n[![](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/pinterest-tag-events.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/pinterest-tag-events.webp)\n\nQuestions?

    "markdown": "# Quora Pixel | RudderStack Docs\n\nSend your event data from RudderStack to Quora Pixel.\n\n* * *\n\n*     5 minute read  \n    \n\n[Quora Conversion Pixel](https://quoraadsupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115010303387-About-the-Quora-Pixel) is a popular advertising and marketing tool to track your website traffic and conversions. If you are running ad campaigns on [Quora](https://quora.com/), you can attribute the downstream user actions on your website to your Quora impressions.\n\n## Getting started\n\nRudderStack supports sending event data to Quora Pixel via the following [connection modes](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/):\n\n| **Connection Mode** | **Web** | **Mobile** | **Server** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Device mode** | **Supported** | \\-  | \\-  |\n| **Cloud mode** | \\-  | \\-  | \\-  |\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> In a web device mode integration, that is, using [JavaScript SDK](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/) as a source, the Quora Pixel native SDK is loaded from `https://a.quora.com/` domain. Based on your website’s content security policy, you might need to [allowlist this domain](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/load-js-sdk/#allowlist-destination-domain) to load the Quora Pixel SDK successfully.\n\nOnce you have confirmed that the source platform supports sending events to Quora Pixel, follow these steps:\n\n1.  From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add the source. Then, from the list of destinations, select **Quora Pixel**.\n2.  Assign a name to your destination and click **Continue**.\n\n### Connection settings\n\nTo successfully configure Quora Pixel as a destination, you need to configure the following settings:\n\n*   **Pixel ID**: Enter the Pixel ID from your Quora Ads Manager Account. For more information on getting your Pixel ID, refer to the [FAQ](#how-do-i-retrieve-the-quora-pixel-id) section below.\n*   **Map RudderStack events to Quora Pixel events**: Use this setting to map your events to specific Quora Pixel events.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> You can map multiple Quora Pixel events to a single RudderStack event and vice versa. If you do not specify a mapping for a particular event, RudderStack maps it to Quora’s **Generic** event.\n\n*   **Client-side Events Filtering**: This setting lets you specify which events should be blocked or allowed to flow through to Quora Pixel. For more information on this setting, refer to the [Client-side Events Filtering](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/event-filtering/) guide.\n*   **Use device mode to send events**: As this is a [web device mode](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#device-mode)\\-only destination, this setting is enabled by default and cannot be disabled.\n*   **OneTrust Cookie Categories**: This setting lets you associate the [OneTrust](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/data-governance/consent-management/onetrust/javascript/) cookie consent groups to the Quora Pixel destination.\n\n## Supported calls\n\nQuora Pixel does not accept the standard RudderStack events, that is, [`identify`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/identify/), [`page`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/page/), etc. directly. You need to first map these event names to the corresponding Quora events in the RudderStack dashboard.\n\nSuppose you specify the following mapping in the RudderStack dashboard:\n\n[![Quora Pixel event mapping use-case](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/quora-pixel-usecase.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/quora-pixel-usecase.webp)\n\nRudderStack then takes the event name `Product Viewed` and maps it to Quora’s `Search` event.\n\nA sample `Product Viewed` event is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"Product Viewed\");\n```\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> You can only pass the event name to Quora Pixel. It does not accept any event properties.\n\nRudderStack sends any event for which the mapping is not specified in the dashboard as a `Generic` event.\n\n## Event mapping\n\nQuora Ads supports two types of events, [Standard](https://quoraadsupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360029101832-Standard-Events) and [Custom](https://quoraadsupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360029101852).\n\n### Standard events\n\nQuora Pixel **natively supports** the following standard events:\n\n| Standard event | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Generic | Used to track generic actions that are not accounted for in the other categories. |\n| Purchase | Used to track purchases of digital or physical goods. |\n| Generate Lead | Used to track the lead generation process. |\n| Complete Registration | Used to track user signups for a newsletter or service. |\n| Add Payment Info | Used to track the linking of payment information to a user’s account. |\n| Add to Cart | Used to track the addition of items to a cart. |\n| Add to Wishlist | Used to track the addition of items to a wishlist. |\n| Initiate Checkout | Used to track the checkout process initialization. |\n| Search | Used to track different types of searches. |\n\nYou can map these events to the RudderStack events via the **Map RudderStack events to Quora Pixel events** dashboard setting.\n\n### Custom events\n\nBefore you map your RudderStack events to Quora’s [custom events](https://quoraadsupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360029101852), make sure you have first configured the custom event in your Quora Ads Manager account.\n\nTo add a new custom event in Quora Ads Manager, follow these steps:\n\n1.  Log into your [Quora Ads Manager Account](https://www.quora.com/ads/account).\n2.  Navigate to the **Pixel & events** tab in your Quora Dashboard.\n3.  Click the **Create event** button to open the **Create custom event** modal.\n4.  Custom events require a name and description, and category. They also require **at least** one URL rule in the **URL Event** setting:\n\n[![Custom Event](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/quora-pixel-custom-event.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/quora-pixel-custom-event.webp)\n\n5.  Click **Create event** to add a new custom event.\n\nBy default, Quora Pixel automatically tracks the custom events based on the **URL Event** setting. You need to include the specific web page URL keywords from which requests will be sent to Quora.\n\nYou can also send a specific RudderStack event as a Quora custom event by choosing the **Custom** event option from the dropdown:\n\n[![Custom Event](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/quora-pixel-custom-events-example.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/quora-pixel-custom-events-example.webp)\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> If you send a [standard event](#standard-events) from a URL that is included in the **URL Event** property of your custom event configured in Quora Pixel, the event will be recorded in Quora as **both** a standard and custom event.\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### How do I retrieve the Quora Pixel ID?\n\nTo retrieve your Pixel ID from the Quora Ads dashboard, follow these steps:\n\n1.  Log into your [Quora Ads Manager Account](https://www.quora.com/ads/account).\n2.  Navigate to the **Pixel & events** tab in your Quora Ads dashboard.\n3.  Click the **Setup Pixel** button to open the **Install the Quora Pixel** modal.\n4.  Select **Install manually** and click the **Next** button.\n5.  In the **Step 1: Install the base Pixel** modal, copy the installation JavaScript snippet and paste it somewhere safe.\n6.  Search for `init` in the snippet. The string corresponding to `init` is your Pixel ID. For example, if your snippet contains the following code:\n\n```\nqp('init', 'd2bnp3ubi9x6zq1p89h5hyx2hf5q1k3v');\n```\n\nIn this case, `d2bnp3ubi9x6zq1p89h5hyx2hf5q1k3v` is your Pixel ID.\n\n#### Can I use the client-side events filtering feature for the custom events?\n\nThe [client-side events filtering](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/event-filtering/) feature is not applicable for custom events. This is because Quora tracks custom events based on the **URL Event** property.\n\nQuestions?

    "markdown": "# Podsights (Spotify Ad Analytics) | RudderStack Docs\n\nSend your event data from RudderStack to Podsights.\n\n* * *\n\n*     8 minute read  \n    \n\n[Podsights](https://podsights.com/) is a podcast advertising and attribution platform. It lets you plan your advertising campaigns and measure the effectiveness of your podcasts through audience insights and real-time impression reporting.\n\n## Getting started\n\nRudderStack supports sending events to Podsights via the following [connection modes](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/):\n\n| **Connection Mode** | **Web** | **Mobile** | **Server** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Device mode** | **Supported** | \\-  | \\-  |\n| **Cloud mode** | \\-  | \\-  | \\-  |\n\nOnce you have confirmed that the source platform supports sending events to Podsights, follow these steps:\n\n1.  From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add the source. Then, from the list of destinations, select **Podsights**.\n2.  Assign a name to your destination and click **Continue**.\n\n## Connection settings\n\nTo successfully configure Podsights as a destination, you will need to configure the following settings:\n\n*   **Pixel ID**: Enter your Podsights Pixel ID. For more information on obtaining your Podsights Pixel ID, refer to the [FAQ](#faq) section below.\n*   **Map Rudder events to Podsights Pixel events**: Use this setting to map your RudderStack events with standard Podsights Pixel events selected from the dropdown. You can map multiple Podsights Pixel events to a single RudderStack event and vice versa.\n*   **Pass Internal ID**: Enable this setting to pass a hashed internal ID in case of `alias` events. For more information on obtaining the internal ID, refer to the [FAQ](#faq) section below.\n*   **Client-side Events Filtering**: This setting lets you specify which events should be blocked or allowed to flow through to Podsights. For more information on this setting, refer to the [Client-side Events Filtering](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/event-filtering/) guide.\n*   **Use device mode to send events**: As this is a [web device mode](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#device-mode)\\-only destination, this setting is enabled by default and cannot be disabled.\n*   **OneTrust Cookie Categories**: This setting lets you associate the [OneTrust](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/data-governance/consent-management/onetrust/javascript/) cookie consent groups to Podsights.\n\n## Track\n\nYou can use the RudderStack [`track`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/track/) event to track user events along with any associated properties and send this information to Podsights.\n\nRudderStack supports the following standard [Podsights Pixel events](https://help.adanalytics.spotify.com/technical-pixel-docs):\n\n| Podsights Pixel event | Event name | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Lead | `lead` | User completed an action like form submission, free trial signup, button click, etc. |\n| Product | `product` | User viewed a product. |\n| Add to cart | `addtocart` | User added a product to cart. |\n| Check out | `checkout` | User initiated a checkout. |\n| Purchase | `purchase` | User purchased a product. |\n\nYou can map your RudderStack events to the above Podsights events in the RudderStack dashboard using the **Map Rudder events to Podsights Pixel Events** setting:\n\n[![RudderStack event mapping with Podsights](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/rudderstack-podsights-event-mapping.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/rudderstack-podsights-event-mapping.webp)\n\nIn the above example, RudderStack maps the event `Order Completed` with the Podsights `checkout` Pixel event.\n\nBy default, RudderStack maps the following events to the Podsights Pixel events:\n\n| RudderStack event | Podsights Pixel event name |\n| --- | --- |\n| `Signed Up` | `lead` |\n| `Product Viewed` | `product` |\n| `Product Added` | `addtocart` |\n| `Checkout Started` | `checkout` |\n| `Order Completed` | `purchase` |\n\nRudderStack prioritizes the custom event mappings you set in the dashboard over the above standard mappings.\n\n### Lead\n\nA sample `track` call mapped to a Podsights `lead` event is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"Signed Up\", {\n  price: 500,\n  currency: \"USD\",\n  type: \"paper\",\n  category: \"Clothes\"\n});\n```\n\nThe following table lists the mapping between the **optional** RudderStack event properties and the Podsight attributes:\n\n| RudderStack property | Podsights property |\n| --- | --- |\n| `properties.price` | `value` |\n| `properties.currency` | `currency` |\n| `properties.type` | `type` |\n| `properties.category` | `category` |\n\n### Product\n\nA sample `track` call mapped to a Podsights `product` event is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"product\", {\n  price: 1300,\n  currency: \"USD\",\n  product_id: \"1234000\",\n  name: \"goldenTest\",\n  product_type: \"Card\",\n  brand: \"testVendor\"\n});\n```\n\nThe following table lists the mapping between the **optional** RudderStack event properties and the Podsight attributes:\n\n| RudderStack property | Podsights property |\n| --- | --- |\n| `properties.price` | `value` |\n| `properties.currency` | `currency` |\n| `properties.product_id` | `product_id` |\n| `properties.name` | `product_name` |\n| `properties.product_type` | `product_type` |\n| `properties.brand` | `product_vendor` |\n\n#### Sending multiple product details\n\nIf you send the product details as an array in the `track` event, RudderStack fetches the details from each product item and calls the Podsights `product` event for each item. For example, consider the following `track` event:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"Product\", {\n  price: 10.0,\n  currency: \"INR\",\n  quantity: 2,\n  products: [\n    {\n      product_id: \"S1100\",\n      name: \"Product 1\",\n      product_type: \"Card\",\n      brand: \"Some Vendor\"\n    },\n    {\n      product_id: \"S1200\",\n      name: \"Product 2\",\n      product_type: \"Card\",\n      brand: \"Some Vendor 2\"\n    }\n  ]\n});\n```\n\nIn this case, RudderStack makes two `track` calls to Podsights with the individual product details:\n\n```\n// Call 1\n\nrudderanalytics.track(\"Product\", {\n  price: 10.0,\n  quantity: 2,\n  currency: \"INR\",\n  product_id: \"S1100\",\n  name: \"Product 1\",\n  product_type: \"Card\",\n  brand: \"Some Vendor\"\n});\n\n// Call 2\n\nrudderanalytics.track(\"Product\", {\n  price: 10.0,\n  quantity: 2,\n  currency: \"INR\",\n  product_id: \"S1200\",\n  name: \"Product 2\",\n  product_type: \"Card\",\n  brand: \"Some Vendor 2\"\n});\n```\n\n### Add to Cart\n\nA sample `track` call mapped to a Podsights `addtocart` event is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"Add to Cart\", {\n  price: 23.2,\n  currency: \"USD\",\n  product_id: \"1234000\",\n  name: \"goldenTest\",\n  product_type: \"Card\",\n  brand: \"testVendor\"\n});\n```\n\nThe following table lists the mapping between the **optional** RudderStack event properties and the Podsight attributes:\n\n| RudderStack property | Podsights property |\n| --- | --- |\n| `properties.price` | `value` |\n| `properties.currency` | `currency` |\n| `properties.product_id` | `product_id` |\n| `properties.name` | `product_name` |\n| `properties.product_type` | `product_type` |\n| `properties.brand` | `product_vendor` |\n| `properties.quantity` | `quantity` |\n| `properties.variant_id` | `variant_id` |\n| `properties.variant_name` | `variant_name` |\n\nSimilar to the [Product](#sending-multiple-product-details) event, if you send the product details as an array in the `track` event, RudderStack fetches the details from each product item and calls the Podsights `addtocart` event for each item.\n\n### Check out\n\nA sample `track` call mapped to a Podsights `checkout` event is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"checkout\", {\n  price: 30.0,\n  currency: \"USD\",\n  discount_code: \"PODCAST_CODE_TEST\",\n  quantity: 3,\n  line_items: [\n    {\n      price: 21.2,\n      quantity: 1,\n      product_id: \"1234000\",\n      product_name: \"goldenTest\",\n      product_type: \"Card\",\n      product_vendor: \"testVendor\",\n      variant_id: \"11112\",\n      variant_name: \"Test\"\n    }\n  ]\n});\n```\n\nThe following table lists the mapping between the **optional** RudderStack event properties and the Podsight attributes:\n\n| RudderStack property | Podsights property |\n| --- | --- |\n| `properties.price` | `value` |\n| `properties.currency` | `currency` |\n| `properties.quantity` | `quantity` |\n| `properties.variant_id` | `variant_id` |\n| `properties.discount_code` | `discount_code` |\n| `properties.line_items` | `line_items` |\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> If you do not pass the `line_items` object, then RudderStack fetches the `line_items` from the event’s properties and maps them to Podsight’s `line_items` field.\n\n#### Passing multiple product items\n\nIf you pass multiple product items as an array, then RudderStack fetches the individual product details and internally builds the `line_items` object before passing it on to Podsights via the `checkout` event, as demonstrated in the following example:\n\nConsider the following `track` event:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"Checkout\", {\n  price: 10.0,\n  currency: \"USD\",\n  quantity: 2,\n  discountCode: \"POD_CODE\",\n  products: [\n    {\n      price: 21.6,\n      quantity: 12,\n      product_id: \"SKU123\",\n      name: \"Card Game\",\n      product_type: \"Card\",\n      brand: \"Some Vendor\",\n      variant_id: \"test123\",\n      variant_name: \"Test 123\"\n    },\n    {\n      price: 42.4,\n      quantity: 2,\n      product_id: \"SKU124\",\n      name: \"Floppy Disk\",\n      product_type: \"Card123\",\n      brand: \"Some Vendor\",\n      variant_id: \"test124\",\n      variant_name: \"Test 124\"\n    }\n  ]\n});\n```\n\nRudderStack internally collates all product information and builds the `line_items` array before sending it to Podsights:\n\n```\npdst(\"checkout\", {\n  price: 10.0,\n  currency: \"USD\",\n  discount_code: \"POD_CODE\",\n  quantity: 2,\n  line_items: [\n    {\n      price: 21.6,\n      quantity: 12,\n      product_id: \"SKU123\",\n      product_name: \"Card Game\",\n      product_type: \"Card\",\n      product_vendor: \"Some Vendor\",\n      variant_id: \"test123\",\n      variant_name: \"Test 123\"\n    },\n    {\n      price: 42.4,\n      quantity: 2,\n      product_id: \"SKU124\",\n      product_name: \"Floppy Disk\",\n      product_type: \"Card123\",\n      product_vendor: \"Some Vendor\",\n      variant_id: \"test124\",\n      variant_name: \"Test 124\"\n    }\n  ]\n});\n```\n\n### Purchase\n\nA sample `track` call mapped to a [`purchase`](https://podsights.com/docs#purchase) event is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"purchase\", {\n  price: 1000,\n  currency: \"rupee\",\n  discountCode: \"PODCAST_CODE\",\n  orderId: \"12322323232\",\n  is_new_customer: true,\n  quantity: 3,\n  line_items: [\n    {\n      price: 21.2,\n      quantity: 1,\n      product_id: \"1234000\",\n      product_name: \"goldenTest\",\n      product_type: \"Card\",\n      product_vendor: \"testVendor\",\n      variant_id: \"11112222\",\n      variant_name: \"testTest\"\n    }\n  ]\n});\n```\n\nThe following table lists the mapping between the **optional** RudderStack event properties and the Podsight attributes:\n\n| RudderStack property | Podsights property |\n| --- | --- |\n| `properties.price` | `value` |\n| `properties.currency` | `currency` |\n| `properties.discountCode` | `discount_code` |\n| `properties.line_items` | `line_items` |\n| `properties.orderId` | `order_id` |\n| `properties.is_new_customer` | `is_new_customer` |\n| `properties.quantity` | `quantity` |\n\nSimilar to the [Check out](#passing-multiple-product-items) event, if you pass multiple product items as an array, then RudderStack fetches the individual product details and internally builds the `line_items` object before passing it on to Podsights via the `purchase` event.\n\n### Passing hashed internal ID to Podsights\n\nIf you turn on **Pass Internal ID** setting in the RudderStack dashboard and **Alias** events are enabled for your Podsight Pixel, then RudderStack triggers a Podsights `alias` event capturing the hashed internal user ID along with every conversion event.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Note that:\n> \n> *   The Podsights `alias` event matches the Podsights internal cookie ID with your hashed internal user IDs.\n> *   RudderStack uses SHA-256 encryption for hashing your `userId`.\n\nTo enable this feature, follow these steps:\n\n1.  Activate **Alias Events** for your Podsights Pixel from your dashboard:\n\n[![Podsights alias event setting](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/pixel-alias-event.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/pixel-alias-event.webp)\n\n2.  Enable the **Pass Internal ID** setting in the RudderStack dashboard.\n\nRudderStack automatically calls the Podsights `alias` event by mapping the following internal RudderStack IDs to Podsights:\n\n| RudderStack attribute | Podsights attribute |\n| --- | --- |\n| `userId`  <br>`context.traits.userId`  <br>`context.traits.id` | `id` |\n\nSuppose you send the following `track` call named `testEvent` mapped to Podsights’ `lead` event with the **Pass Internal ID** enabled:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"testEvent\", {\n  price: 100,\n  currency: \"euro\",\n  type: \"paper\"\n});\n```\n\nRudderStack then makes the following two calls to Podsights:\n\n[![Alias calls made to Podsights](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/spotify-alias-calls.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/spotify-alias-calls.webp)\n\n## Page\n\nYou can use the [`page`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/page/) call to record your website’s page views with any additional information about the viewed page.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> You can also set custom attributes inside the `page` event properties.\n\nRudderStack sends the `page` calls to Podsights as a `view` event.\n\nA sample `page` call is as shown:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.page(\"Home\", \"Clothes\", {\n  path: \"/best-seller/1\",\n  referrer: \"https://www.google.com/search?q=estore+bestseller\",\n  url: \"https://www.estore.com/best-seller/1\"\n});\n```\n\n### Supported property mappings\n\nRudderStack maps the following **optional** properties with the Podsights properties:\n\n| RudderStack property | Podsights property |\n| --- | --- |\n| `context.page.referrer` | `referrer` |\n| `context.page.url` | `url` |\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### Where can I find the Podsights Pixel ID?\n\nTo get your Podsights Pixel ID, follow these steps:\n\n1.

    "markdown": "# Pinterest Tag cloud mode | RudderStack Docs\n\nSend events to Pinterest Tag using cloud mode.\n\n* * *\n\n*     6 minute read  \n    \n\nRudderStack lets you send your event data to [Pinterest Conversions API](https://s.pinimg.com/ct/docs/conversions_api/dist/v3.html) via [cloud mode](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#cloud-mode). It sends the event calls in a [batch](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/api/http-api/#batch), where each batch can contain upto 1000 events.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> *   To use Pinterest Tag’s cloud mode (Pinterest conversions API), contact [Pinterest Support](https://help.pinterest.com/en/contact) to enable the beta access.\n> *   Pinterest is migrating to API v5 and will deprecate support for API v3 on June 30, 2023. Hence, it is recommended to [configure Pinterest Tag](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/pinterest-ads/setting-up-pinterest-ads/#connection-settings) as a destination in RudderStack using API v5.\n\nFind the open source code for this destination in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-transformer/tree/master/src/v0/destinations/pinterest_tag).\n\n## Track\n\nThe [`track`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/track/) call allows you to capture the users’ conversion events.\n\nRudderStack maps the `track` events as specified in the **Map Your Events To Pinterest Events** connection setting in the dashboard.\n\nA sample `track` call is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"Order Completed\", {\n  event_id: 'eventIDordercompleted',\n  order_id: \"transactionId\",\n  value: 35.00,\n  revenue: 31.98,\n  currency: 'USD',\n  products: [{\n    product_id: '123454387',\n    price: 3.00,\n    quantity: 2,\n    currency: 'USD',\n    position: 1,\n    value: 6.00,\n  }]\n}, {\n  traits: {\n    email: \"alex@example.com\",\n    lastname: \"Keener\",\n    firstname: \"Alex\",\n    action_source: \"offline\" // or app_ios / app_android / web\n  }\n});\n```\n\n### Ecommerce conversion tracking\n\nRudderStack supports ecommerce conversion tracking for Pinterest. You can use the [Ecommerce Events Specification](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/ecommerce-events-spec/) for sending the events while instrumenting your site with the RudderStack SDK.\n\nThe following table mentions how the specific RudderStack `track` Ecommerce events are mapped to standard Pinterest Conversion Events:\n\n| RudderStack event | Pinterest event |\n| --- | --- |\n| Order Completed | `checkout` |\n| Product Added | `add_to_cart` |\n| Products Searched | `search` |\n| Product List Filtered | `search` |\n\nYou can also track a custom event that you want to include in the conversion reporting. It will be mapped to a custom Pinterest event, for example:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"custom event\")\n```\n\n### Standard Pinterest events\n\nPinterest supports the following nine standard events that can be mapped and tracked for reporting. Any event apart from these is treated as a user-defined event.\n\n*   `checkout`\n*   `add_to_cart`\n*   `page_visit`\n*   `signup`\n*   `watch_video`\n*   `lead`\n*   `search`\n*   `view_category`\n*   `custom`\n\n## Page\n\nThe [`page`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/page/) call lets you record your website’s page views with any additional relevant information about the viewed page.\n\n*   **`view_category`**: RudderStack sends this event if both the `name` and `category` fields are present. The below sample event contains both the fields and is mapped to the Pinterest’s `view_category` event:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.page(\"Best Seller\", \"Games\", {\n  path: \"/best-seller/games/1\",\n  url: \"https://www.estore.com/best-seller/games/1\",\n  title: \"Best selling games offered by EStore\",\n  search: \"estore bestseller games\",\n  referrer: \"https://www.google.com/search?q=estore+bestseller\",\n  testDimension: \"true\",\n})\n```\n\n*   **`page_visit`**: RudderStack sends this event if only `name` field is present and drops any additional properties. The below sample event contains only `name` and is mapped to the Pinterest’s `page_visit` event:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.page(\"Best Seller\", {\n  path: \"/best-seller/1\",\n})\n```\n\n## Common field mappings\n\nThe following table lists the mappings specific for Pinterest Conversion API and are relevant for both the `track` and `page` calls:\n\n| RudderStack property | Pinterest Tag property | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `message.event`  <br>Required | `event_name` | Type of the user event. |\n| `context.traits.action_source`  <br>`properties.action_source`  <br>`message.channel`  <br>Required | `action_source` | Source indicating the occurence of conversion event. |\n| `timestamp`  <br>Required | `event_time` | Unix timestamp (in UTC) in seconds indicating when the user conversion event occurred. |\n| `destination.Config.advertiserId`  <br>Required | `advertiser_id` | Pinterest Advertiser ID. |\n| Integrations Object `messageId` | `event_id` | Deduplication key from the dashboard setting or `messageId`. The dashboard setting is given higher priority. |\n| `pageUrl` | `event_source_url` | URL of the web conversion event. |\n| `context.device.adTrackingEnabled` | `opt_out` | *   When `action_source` is **web** or **offline**, it defines whether the user has opted out of tracking for web conversion events.<br>*   When `action_source` is **app\\_android** or **app\\_ios**, it defines whether the user

Based on your website’s content security policy, you might need to [allowlist this domain](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/load-js-sdk/#allowlist-destination-domain) to load the Reddit Pixel SDK successfully.\n\nOnce you have confirmed that the source platform supports sending events to Reddit Pixel, follow these steps:\n\n1.  From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add the source. Then, from the list of destinations, select **Reddit Pixel**.\n2.  Assign a name to your destination and click **Continue**.\n\n## Connection settings\n\nTo successfully configure Reddit Pixel as a destination, configure the following settings:\n\n*   **Pixel ID**: Enter your Reddit [Pixel ID](#faq).\n*   **Mapping to trigger the Reddit Pixel events for the respective events set here**: Use this setting to map custom event names to the standard Reddit Pixel events.\n*   **Client-side Events Filtering**: This setting lets you specify which events should be blocked or allowed to flow through to Reddit Pixel. Refer to the [Client-side Events Filtering](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/event-filtering/) guide for more information.\n*   **Use device mode to send events**: As this is a web device mode-only destination, this setting is enabled by default and cannot be disabled.\n*   **OneTrust Cookie Categories**: This setting lets you associate [OneTrust](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/data-governance/consent-management/onetrust/javascript/) cookie consent groups to Reddit Pixel.\n\n## Identify\n\nYou can use the [`identify`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/identify/) call to update the user’s signup information.\n\nA sample `identify` call is as shown:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify()\n```\n\n## Page\n\nWhen you make a [`page`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/page/) call, the `track` event is sent as `PageVisit` to `rdt('track,'PageVisit')`. RudderStack ignores any parameter sent to `rudderanalytics.page()`.\n\nA sample `page` call is as shown:\n\n## Track\n\nThe [`track`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/track/) call lets you capture user events along with the properties associated with them.\n\nA sample `track` call is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"Product Added\")\n```\n\n### Property mappings\n\nThe following table lists the event mapping from RudderStack to Reddit Pixel’s standard events:\n\n| RudderStack event | Reddit Pixel standard event |\n| --- | --- |\n| `Product Added` | `Add to Cart` |\n| `Product Added to Wishlist` | `Add to Wishlist` |\n| `Order Completed` | `Purchase` |\n\nThe following table lists the custom events mapping from RudderStack to Reddit Pixel’s standard events:\n\n| RudderStack event | Reddit Pixel standard event |\n| --- | --- |\n| `Lead` | `Lead` |\n| `View Content` | `ViewContent` |\n| `Search` | `Search` |\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> Reddit Pixel does not support any other custom events apart from the ones mentioned above.\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### Where can I find the Pixel ID in Reddit Pixel?\n\n1.  Log in to the [Reddit Ads Manager account](https://accounts.reddit.com/adsregister).\n2.  Select **Events Manager** from the drop-down menu in the top-left corner.\n\n[![](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/reddit-pixel-id-1.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/reddit-pixel-id-1.webp)\n\n3.

Rakuten then reduces the transaction amount by a defined tax rate. |\n\n## Discount reporting\n\nFor accurate discount reporting, make sure to report only product discounts or discounts that reduce a product subtotal. Do not include free shipping in the discount amount.\n\nSuppose a customer purchases 1 item of SKU A for $10.00 and 2 items of SKU B for $45.00 each and then redeems a 10% order-level discount. In that case, Rakuten provides two options for reporting discounts:\n\n*   Reduced item reporting (preferred)\n*   Discounts as SKU\n\n### Reduced item reporting\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Rakuten prescribes this reporting method for selected goods commissioning, that is, if you want to commission by product type.\n\nIn this case, you can adjust the reported amount value to reflect the applied discounts. In the above example, you can send the amounts in a `product` array as $9.00 and $81.00 respectively for the two SKUs.\n\nFor multiple item purchases, disperse the discounts accordingly among each value in the total amount value.\n\n### Discounts as SKU\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Rakuten prescribes this method if you intend to set the same commission on all goods.\n\nFor this reporting model, add an extra value to the `sku`, `quantity`, `amount`, and the product `name` fields that depict the discount.\n\n*   For `sku`, and `name`, use the string `Discount`.\n*   For `quantity`, use `0`.\n*   For `amount`, use the negative dollar value of the discount.\n\nA sample `track` event highlighting this method is shown:\n\n```\nrudderananlytics.track('event', {\n  products: [{\n      sku: 'sku1',\n      amount: '100'\n      quantity: 1\n    },\n    {\n      sku: 'Discount',\n      name: 'Discount',\n      amount: -10 // Total discount of 10\n      quantity: 0\n    }\n  ]\n})\n```\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### Why are products commissionable even if `iscomm` is set to `N` (no)?\n\nNote that `iscomm` is applicable for the entire order.\n\nEven if you have `iscomm=N` in the postback, the transaction is still commissionable in Rakuten. You need to explicitly set the dynamic commissioning rules (for example, if `iscomm` equals `N`, pay $0 commission) in the Rakuten dashboard to avoid paying commission for a particular order.\n\n#### How can I report a returned item in `Order Cancelled` or `Partially Cancelled` events?\n\nSuppose a customer returns two items of SKU A and one item of SKU B, the cancellation records would look like below:\n\n```\nrudderananlytics.track('event', {\n  orderId: \"ord123\",\n  land: 1133,\n  ranSiteId: \"846t21983y3-231824et12-e12-ey1208e12-14\",\n  cur: 'USD',\n  products: [{\n      sku: 'A',\n      amount: '-200'\n      quantity: 2,\n      name: 'name_1'\n    },\n    {\n      sku: 'B',\n      amount: -10\n      quantity: 1,\n      name: 'name_2'\n    }\n  ]\n})\n```\n\nNote that the quantity shows the number of returned items and price is negative, reflecting the return. Quantity is not a negative number for returns unless the price in the original order was zero.\n\nYou must also account for any discounts applied during the order cancellation. For reduced item discount reporting, note that:\n\n*   If you are using discount as a SKU option, send a cancellation record for the discount SKU item **in addition** to the regular SKUs of the order for cancellation.\n\nQuestions?

    "markdown": "# Reddit Destination | RudderStack Docs\n\nSend your event data from RudderStack to Reddit.\n\n* * *\n\n*     3 minute read  \n    \n\nReddit’s [Conversions API](https://reddit.my.site.com/helpcenter/s/article/Conversions-API) is a server-to-server solution for tracking and sharing your web conversion data with Reddit.\n\nFind the open source transformer code for this destination in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-transformer/tree/main/src/cdk/v2/destinations/reddit).\n\n## Setup\n\n1.  In your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), go to **Directory** > **Destinations** > **Cloud Destinations** and search for **Reddit**.\n2.  Connect your source and click **Continue**.\n\n### Connection settings\n\nConfigure the following settings to set up Reddit as a destination in RudderStack:\n\n*   **Name**: Assign a name to uniquely identify the destination.\n*   Under **Account Settings**, click **Create Account** > **Connect with Reddit**. Give RudderStack the necessary permissions to access your Reddit account.\n*   **Account ID**: Enter the [Pixel ID](#faq) of your Reddit Ads account that the conversion events belong to.\n*   **Hash Data**: This setting is turned on by default. RudderStack hash encrypts the event properties (for example, `email`, `userId`, `ip`, etc.) before sending them to Reddit.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> If you are already hashing this data before sending it to RudderStack, make sure to turn off this setting.\n\n### Configuration settings\n\nAfter completing the initial setup, configure the following settings to correctly receive your data in Reddit:\n\n*   **OneTrust Cookie Categories**: This setting lets you associate the [OneTrust](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/data-governance/consent-management/onetrust/javascript/) cookie consent groups to Reddit.\n\n### Event mapping settings\n\n*   **RudderStack to Reddit event mappings**: Click **Set up mapping** to map your RudderStack events to specific Reddit events. You can also use the JSON mapper to set these mappings.\n\n[![Reddit event mapping setting](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/reddit-event-mapping.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/reddit-event-mapping.webp)\n\n## Track\n\nYou can use the [`track`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/track/) call to record and send conversion events along with any associated properties to Reddit for processing.\n\nA sample `track` event sent to Reddit:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"Order Completed\", {\n  revenue: 500,\n  currency: \"INR\",\n  conversionId: \"G53B1A44XQ\",\n  clickId: \"4583752045291814500\",\n  products: [{\n    product_id: \"item1\",\n    sku: \"9472-775-0112\",\n    name: \"Sample Item\",\n    price: 30,\n    position: 1,\n    category: \"Sample Items\"\n    url: \"https://www.website.com/sample-product/\",\n    image_url: \"https://www.website.com/product/path.jpg\",\n  }]\n}, {\n  traits: {\n    email: \"alex@example.com\",\n    userId: \"1hKOmRA4GRlm\",\n    firstName: \"Alex\",\n    lastName: \"Keener\"\n  }\n});\n```\n\nBy default, RudderStack maps the following standard [ecommerce events](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/ecommerce-events-spec/) to Reddit’s `tracking_type` events:\n\n| RudderStack event | Reddit `tracking_type` event |\n| --- | --- |\n| `Product Viewed`  <br>`Product List Viewed` | `ViewContent` |\n| `Product Added` | `AddToCart` |\n| `Product Added to Wishlist` | `AddToWishlist` |\n| `Order Completed` | `Purchase` |\n| `Products Searched` | `Search` |\n\nYou can also use the [Event mapping settings](#event-mapping-settings) in the RudderStack dashboard to map your events to specific Reddit events.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> Note that if your events are not mapped and do not belong to the above standard RudderStack ecommerce events, RudderStack automatically sends it as a custom event and maps it to Reddit’s `Custom` tracking type.\n\n### Supported mappings\n\nRudderStack maps the following event properties in the `track` events to the corresponding Reddit fields:\n\n| RudderStack property | Reddit property |\n| --- | --- |\n| `event`  <br>Required | `tracking_type` as set in the dashboard or as per the above standard mapping. |\n| `event`  <br>Required | `custom_event_name` with `tracking_type` set to `Custom` |\n| `originalTimestamp`  <br>Required | `event_at` |\n| `properties.clickId` | `click_id` |\n| `traits.email`  <br>`context.traits.email` | `user.email` |\n| `context.ip`  <br>`request_ip` | `user.ip_address` |\n| `context.userAgent` | `user.user_agent` |\n| `context.device.advertisingId` | `user.idfa` OR `user.aaid` |\n| `properties.optOut` | `opt_out` |\n| `properties.conversionId`  <br>`messageId` | `event_metadata.conversion_id` |\n| `properties.currency` | `event_metadata.currency` |\n| `properties.products.$.category` | `event_metadata.products.$.category` |\n| `properties.products.$.product_id` | `event_metadata.products.$.id` |\n| `properties.products.$.name` | `event_metadata.products.$.name` |\n| `properties.revenue` | `event_metadata.value` |\n| `properties.products.$.quantity`  <br>`properties.quantity`  <br>`properties.item_count` | `event_metadata.item_count` |\n| `context. traits.userId` | user.external\\_id |\n| `properties.uuid` | `user.uuid` |\n| `context.screen.height` | `user.screen_dimensions.height` |\n| `context.screen.width` | `user.screen_dimensions.width` |\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### Where can I find the Pixel ID?\n\n1.
