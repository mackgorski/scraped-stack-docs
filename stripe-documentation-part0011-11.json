  "markdown": "# How subscriptions work | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\nTo simplify the handling of failed payments and to create subscriptions before attempting payment:\n\n1.  Pass [payment\\_behavior=default\\_incomplete](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/create#create_subscription-payment_behavior) when creating a subscription. If your subscription requires payment, it’s created with an `incomplete` status, otherwise your subscription immediately becomes `active`.\n2.  Activate an incomplete subscription by paying the first invoice.\n3.  Pass the payment intent identifier from the invoice to your user interface to collect payment information and confirm the payment intent. You can use [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/js/elements_object), the [Android SDK](https://stripe.dev/stripe-android/), or the [iOS SDK](https://stripe.dev/stripe-ios/).\n\n### Payment status ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nThe payment process differs across payment methods and geographical locations. Payments can also fail initially (for example, a customer might enter the wrong card number or have insufficient funds), so various payment outcomes are possible.\n\nA [PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents) tracks the lifecycle of every payment. Whenever a payment is due for a subscription, Stripe generates an invoice and a PaymentIntent. The PaymentIntent ID attaches to the invoice and you can access it from the Invoice and Subscription objects. The state of the PaymentIntent affects the state of the invoice and the subscription. Here’s how the different outcomes of a payment map to the different statuses:\n\n| Payment outcome | PaymentIntent status | Invoice status | Subscription status |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Success | `succeeded` | `paid` | `active` |\n| Fails because of a card error | `requires_payment_method` | `open` | `incomplete` |\n| Fails because of authentication | `requires_action` | `open` | `incomplete` |\n\nThe following sections explain these statuses and the actions to take for each.\n\n### Payment succeeded ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nWhen your payment succeeds, the status of the PaymentIntent is `succeeded`, and the subscription becomes `active`. For [payment methods](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/integration-options) with longer processing periods, subscriptions are immediately activated. In these cases, the status of the PaymentIntent may be `processing` for an `active` subscription until the payment succeeds.\n\nWith your subscription now activated, provision access to your product. Read the guide to learn more about [the subscription lifecycle](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/overview#subscription-lifecycle) and best practices for provisioning.\n\n| Response | Subscription | PaymentIntent |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `{   \"id\": \"sub_1ELI8bClCIKljWvsvK36TXlC\",   \"object\": \"subscription\",   \"status\": \"active\",   ...   \"latest_invoice\": {     \"id\": \"in_EmGqfJMYy3Nt9M\",     \"status\": \"paid\",     ...     \"payment_intent\": {       \"status\": \"succeeded\",       ...     }   } }` | **active** | **succeeded** |\n\n![Subscription payment network flow.](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/payment-flow-succeeds.ac7343c9ec9a77e6efa1a84c02bb597d.svg)\n\n### Requires payment method ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nIf payment fails because of a [card error](https://docs.stripe.com/api/errors#errors-card_error), such as a [decline](https://docs.stripe.com/declines#issuer-declines), the status of the PaymentIntent is `requires_payment_method` and the subscription is `incomplete`.\n\n| Response | Subscription | PaymentIntent |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `{   \"id\": \"sub_1ELI8bClCIKljWvsvK36TXlC\",   \"object\": \"subscription\",   \"status\": \"incomplete\",   ...   \"latest_invoice\": {     \"id\": \"in_EmGqfJMYy3Nt9M\",     \"status\": \"open\",     ...     \"payment_intent\": {       \"status\": \"requires_payment_method\",       ...     }   } }` | **incomplete** | **requires\\_payment\\_method** |\n\nTo resolve these scenarios:\n\n*   Notify the customer.\n*   Collect new payment information and [confirm the payment intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/confirm).\n*   Update the [default payment method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/object#subscription_object-default_payment_method) on the subscription.\n\nLearn how to [handle payment failures for subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/webhooks#payment-failures).\n\n![How to handle subscription payment failures.](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/payment-flow-requires-payment-method.8305917aa91650ba7f7e9b6e5999ce32.svg)\n\n### Requires action ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nSome payment methods require customer authentication with [3D Secure](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure) (3DS) to complete the payment process. If you use the [Payment Intents API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents), the value of `latest_invoice.payment_intent.status` is `requires_action` when a customer needs to authenticate a payment. 3DS completes the authentication process. Whether a payment method requires authentication depends on your [Radar rules](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure/authentication-flow#three-ds-radar) and the issuing bank for the card.\n\nRegulations in Europe often require 3D Secure. See [Strong Customer Authentication](https://docs.stripe.com/strong-customer-authentication) to determine whether handling this status is important for your business. If you have an existing billing integration and want to add support for this flow, also see the [Billing SCA Migration guide](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication).\n\n| Response | Subscription | PaymentIntent |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `{   \"id\": \"sub_1ELI8bClCIKljWvsvK36TXlC\",   \"object\": \"subscription\",   \"status\": \"incomplete\",   ...   \"latest_invoice\": {     \"id\": \"in_EmGqfJMYy3Nt9M\",     \"status\": \"open\",     ...     \"payment_intent\": {       \"status\": \"requires_action\",       \"client_secret\": \"pi_91_secret_W9\",       \"next_action\": {         \"type\": \"use_stripe_sdk\",         ...       },       ...     }   } }` | **incomplete** | **requires\\_action** |\n\nTo handle these scenarios:\n\n*   Monitor for the `invoice.payment_action_required` event notification with [webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/webhooks). This indicates that authentication is required.\n*   Notify your customer that they must authenticate.\n*   Retrieve the client secret for the payment intent and pass it in a call to [stripe.ConfirmCardPayment](https://docs.stripe.com/js/payment_intents/confirm_card_payment). This displays an authentication modal to your customers, attempts payment, then closes the modal and returns context to your application.\n*   Monitor the `invoice.paid` event on your webhook endpoint to verify that the payment succeeded. Users can leave your application before `confirmCardPayment()` finishes. Verifying whether the payment succeeded allows you to correctly provision your product.\n\n![How to handle subscription payments that require additional action from the customer.](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/payment-flow-requires-action.ac57889e9bccdb6ec4f5ea47fba194ec.svg)\n\n### Recurring charges ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nStripe handles recurring charges for you automatically. This includes:\n\n*   [Automatically invoicing](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/invoices/subscription#subscription-renewal) customers and attempting payments when new billing cycles start.\n*   When payments fail, Stripe retries them using the [Smart Retries](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/automatic-collection#smart-retries) feature or your custom retry schedule. This automatically re-attempts payment according to your Dashboard settings when cards are declined. If a failure returns a non-retryable [decline code](https://docs.stripe.com/declines/codes), the scheduled retries continue but the payment executes only if you obtain a new payment method.\n\nYou can send a [dunning email](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/send-email \"dunning email\") to customers for overdue payments to increase recovery chances. For payments that require 3D Secure, you can [configure your billing settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/billing/automatic) to send a [hosted link](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/hosted-invoice-page) to customers so they can complete the flow.\n\n#### Build your own handling for recurring charge failures![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nIf you don’t want to use Stripe’s tooling to manage failures, you can build your own. If a payment fails or if it requires customer authentication, the subscription’s `status` is set to `past_due` and the PaymentIntent status is either `requires_payment_method` or `requires_action`.\n\n![Objects involved when handling failed or action required subscription payments.](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/recurring-charge-failure.f0db8a9b3a90000f3df0b98f7aacfa36.svg)\n\nTo manage these scenarios, set up a [webhook](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks \"webhook\") and listen to the [customer.subscription.updated](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-customer.subscription.updated) event so that you’re notified when subscriptions enter a `past_due` state:\n\n`{   \"id\": \"sub_E8uXk63MAbZbto\",   \"object\": \"subscription\",   ...   \"status\": \"past_due\",   \"latest_invoice\": \"in_1EMLu1ClCIKljWvsfTjRFAxa\" }`\n\nFor these subscriptions, you need to get your customers back into your application to collect a different payment method so they can complete the payment. You can use an email or a mobile push notification. Stripe provides built-in reminder emails to handle this case, which you can configure in your [billing settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/billing/automatic).\n\nWhen your customer is back in your application, reuse either your [payment failure flow](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/overview#requires-payment-method) or [customer action flow](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/overview#requires-action) depending on the status of the associated PaymentIntent. After the payment succeeds, the status of the subscription is `active` and the invoice is `paid`.\n\n### Handle non-payment invoices ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nSubscriptions that include [free trials](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/trials), [usage-based billing](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/pricing-models#usage-based-pricing), invoices with coupons, or applied customer credit balances often result in non-payment invoices. This means you don’t immediately charge your customer when you create the subscription.\n\nEven though you don’t charge customers for the first invoice, authenticating and authorizing their card is often beneficial as it can increase the chance that the first non-zero payment completes successfully. Payments made this way are known as off-session payments. To manage these scenarios, Stripe created SetupIntents.\n\n#### Using SetupIntents ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nYou can use SetupIntents to:\n\n*   Collect payment information.\n*   Authenticate your customer’s card to claim [exemptions](https://stripe.com/guides/strong-customer-authentication#exemptions-to-strong-customer-authentication \"SCA exemptions\") later.\n*   Authorize your customer’s card without charging it.\n\nAuthenticating payments allows your customer to grant permissions to charge their card. [Strong Customer Authentication](https://docs.stripe.com/strong-customer-authentication) requires this, and [3DS](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure) is a common way to complete it. Collecting payment method information and authorizing it ensures that you can successfully charge the payment method.\n\nIn off-session scenarios, SetupIntents enable you to charge customers for their first non-zero payment without having to bring them back to your website or app for authentication. This reduces the friction on your customers.\n\nThe `pending_setup_intent` field on a subscription doesn’t cancel automatically when the subscription ends. Listen for `customer.subscription.deleted` webhooks and manually [cancel a subscription SetupIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_intents/cancel) if needed.\n\nStripe automatically creates SetupIntents for subscriptions that don’t require an initial payment. The authentication and authorization process also completes at this point, if required. If both succeed or aren’t required, no action is necessary, and the `subscription.pending_setup_intent` field is `null`. If either step fails, Stripe recommends using the SetupIntent on your frontend to resolve the issue while your customer is on-session. The next two sections explain in detail how to manage scenarios where authentication or authorization fail.\n\n#### Managing authentication failures Client-side ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nAuthentication failures occur when Stripe is unable to authenticate your customer with their card issuer. When this happens, the `status` of the SetupIntent is set to `requires_action`.\n\n![How to handle subscription payment authentication failures.](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/authentication_failure.2eaec43cac8c688f0ff3438fbe3b50e4.svg)\n\nTo resolve these scenarios, call [confirmCardSetup](https://docs.stripe.com/js#stripe-confirm-card-setup) on your frontend so that your customer can complete the authentication flow manually. The code example below [expands](https://docs.stripe.com/api/expanding_objects) the `pending_setup_intent` to complete the flow.\n\n`const {pending_setup_intent} = subscription;  if (pending_setup_intent) {   const {client_secret, status} = subscription.pending_setup_intent;    if (status === \"requires_action\") {     const {setupIntent, error} = await stripe.confirmCardSetup(client_secret);      if (error) {       // Display error.message in your UI.     } else {       // The setup has succeeded. Display a success message.     }   } }`\n\nAfter completing this flow, authorization executes if it’s required. If authorization succeeds, or if it’s not required, `pending_setup_intent` is updated to `null` upon completion.\n\nPayment authorization failures occur when Stripe can’t verify that a card can be charged. When this happens, the `status` of the SetupIntent is set to `requires_payment_method`. This generally means that subsequent charges with that card fail.\n\n![How to handle subscription payment authorization failures.](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/authorization_failure.0b6ca4a2e2bbeba11710bf22fb0a5d00.svg)\n\nTo resolve these scenarios, [collect a new payment method](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/overview#requires-payment-method), then update the default payment method for your customer or the subscription. The code example below [expands](https://docs.stripe.com/api/expanding_objects) the `pending_setup_intent` to complete the flow.\n\n`const {pending_setup_intent, latest_invoice} = subscription;  if (pending_setup_intent) {   const {client_secret, status} = subscription.pending_setup_intent;    if (status === \"requires_action\") {     const {setupIntent, error} = await stripe.confirmCardSetup(client_secret);      if (error) {       // Display error.message in your UI.     } else {       // The setup has succeeded. Display a success message.     }   } else if (status === \"requires_payment_method\") {     // Collect new payment method   } }`",

  "markdown": "# Design your app | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Get started with design tools, guidelines, and philosophy.\n\nStripe Apps lets you build your own app on top of Stripe’s platform. You can give your app a user interface in the Stripe Dashboard by [building a UI extension](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/build-ui). If you do create a user interface for your app, use the provided tools and guidelines to simplify the design process.\n\nStripe Apps provides [UI components](#components-and-patterns), [common design patterns](#components-and-patterns), and a [Figma UI toolkit](#figma-ui-toolkit).\n\n## Brand expression and custom styling![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n### Custom styling![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nCustom styling of UI elements is intentionally limited. This is to maintain platform consistency with core UI elements and to ensure a high accessibility bar. In particular, we limit the colors you can use for each element because color contrast is an important aspect of accessible UI.\n\n### Branding elements![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nTo make your app visually distinctive, use the _app indicator_, a color bar and icon at the top of the app that helps users quickly identify which app they’re in. Unlike other UI elements, you can select any color for the app indicator.\n\nSelect your brand’s primary color and a simple icon or logo to match with it. Specify the color and icon using the `brandIcon` and `brandColor` props of your app’s [ContextView](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/components/contextview) component.\n\n![Five example apps with different color schemes and icons](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/branding.a28aed3191edfeb83ac39ca45f6638bc.png)\n\nHow your brand color and icon choices appear to users\n\n## Components and patterns![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nStripe Apps provides a range of [UI components](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/components) you can combine to create more complex UIs.\n\n[Patterns](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/patterns) are compositions of components that demonstrate how to use the latest UI components effectively. Using recommended patterns to build your app is the fastest way to make sure users have a high quality, consistent experience. It also speeds up the app review process.\n\nThe Figma UI toolkit contains every component, pattern, and a few example apps. It’s available at [@stripedesign](https://www.figma.com/@stripedesign) on Figma Community.\n\n[View UI toolkit](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1105918844720321397)\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/ui-toolkit.45d84fe75b99d7ad307123e89be508bc.png)\n\nThe Figma UI toolkit\n\n## UI components![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nStripe users expect a consistent look and feel across the Stripe Dashboard, and Stripe Apps provides UI components to help you create them. These components are in an expandable drawer for Stripe Apps in the Dashboard.\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/user-experience.f17e6a3c8a23fcc4cb78f414c6c2d066.png)\n\nUsers see your app’s UI extension in the Stripe Dashboard\n\nWhen users install an app that uses UI extensions, the app appears in a dock. When they click the dock, a drawer opens to show details about your app and actions users can take.\n\n## Available surfaces![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe app drawer serves as the entry point for all apps a user has installed. You can display it on several surfaces. A _surface_ is a viewport corresponding to a page on the Stripe Dashboard.\n\n### Details pages![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nDetails pages give a detailed look into a particular Stripe object—for example, a details page for a single payment, invoice, subscription, customer, or product. On a details page, your app can access information about the current object using the [UI extensions SDK](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/reference/extensions-sdk-api). For security reasons, this requires permission. For more information, see [Permissions](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/reference/permissions).\n\nConsider the Stripe objects that best correspond to your product, and build relevant apps across each one of them. Stripe Apps is an opportunity to build a contextual app that meets users in their existing workflows.\n\n### List pages![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nList pages give an overview of activity on your account: for example, the [Customers page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/customers) lists all customers, and the [Payments page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/payments) lists all payments.\n\nNot every app needs to have a view for list pages. Only build for list pages if you have features to offer that don’t relate to a specific object.\n\n### Home![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe Stripe Dashboard homepage gives users a quick overview of their business and routes them to core workflows. Consider building apps for the home surface if you can showcase a relevant overview of the user’s business, corresponding to your product and its intersection with Stripe.\n\nNot every app needs to have a view for the home surface. Only build for home if you have relevant overview material to show incoming users.\n\n## App anatomy![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/app-anatomy.c14d4c86a8882de27b023d62302faba6.png)\n\nThe parts of a Stripe app\n\n**App indicator** helps users identify which app they’re in. It contextually appears on the pages that you’ve built an app for. Users identify and invoke your app by seeing and clicking the app icon.\n\n**Header** houses your app name, view name, external link to your product, and a few top level actions that the user can perform on your app.\n\n**Content** is the blank canvas for your app that you can compose using the available set of UI components.\n\n**App Marketplace entrypoint** is the entry point for exploring and adding new apps. When a user adds a new app from the App Marketplace, the dock updates to show the new app’s icon.\n\n**Active app icon** is an icon that represents the currently selected app. If the user has other apps installed, their app icons appear above or below in the app dock. To set your app icon, use the [app manifest reference documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/reference/app-manifest).\n\n## Types of views![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nAn app can be built of three different view types:\n\n1.  [ContextView](#contextview)\n2.  [FocusView](#focusview)\n3.  [SettingsView](#settingsview)\n\nThe view determines what the user sees at different points to engage with your app. Views are similar to the different HTML pages of a website.\n\n`ContextView` is the default view of your app. `SettingsView` is for the settings page. Both of these views are view root components, meaning they serve as base containers for other components to populate. Every component must have a view root component.\n\n#### `ContextView` ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/views-contextview.be48c893f02a6e6be989ec659ddd29a7.png)\n\nWhat ContextView looks like\n\nThe first view of the app must be a [ContextView](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/components/contextview).\n\n`ContextView` allows apps to render next to Stripe content in a drawer, so users can look at them side-by-side and share context across your app and the Stripe content.\n\nThese in-context modules allow the app to meet users in their existing workflows and augment them with contextual information and actions.\n\nA user’s interaction with an app always begins with a `ContextView`. Each app must have at least one `ContextView` (per viewport), which acts as the default view when it loads—similar to the `index.html` of a website).\n\n#### `FocusView` ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/views-focusview.3e3f40d737518fc2f2e083cc6395710c.png)\n\nWhat FocusView looks like\n\nA [FocusView](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/components/focusview) is for deeper or longer workflows, triggered from a `ContextView`.\n\nIn `FocusView`, a blocking backdrop is applied to the rest of the page to focus the user’s attention on the current view, reinforcing their purpose for any focused, start-to-finish tasks.\n\nThe backdrop doesn’t allow the user to interact with the contents of the page behind the drawer.\n\nChoose `FocusView` when:\n\n*   Your user is filling a form or performing a workflow that doesn’t need the immediate context of the Stripe page, and shouldn’t be easily interrupted\n*   You need a wider canvas to show a more complex view (for example, to preview a foreign object, like a support ticket).\n\n#### Not sure which view?\n\nWhen choosing between `ContextView` and `FocusView`, default to `ContextView`. This view provides users with Stripe content and your app’s content side-by-side.\n\nChoose `FocusView` when it’s important for the user to complete a focused task, from start to finish, or when you need a wider canvas to show a more complex view.\n\n#### `SettingsView` ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/views-settings.b878b0d4b8240d7f3f2cdb89d5fc7626.png)\n\nWhat SettingsView looks like\n\nA [SettingsView](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/components/settingsview) appears on your app’s configuration page to let you provide custom settings for your app. Learn how to [add an app settings page](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/app-settings).",

  "markdown": "# Toolkit CSV reference | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Follow best practices to successfully migrate your subscriptions using the no-code Billing migration toolkit.\n\nUse this guide to help you specify your CSV file in the Billing migration toolkit. In the following examples, all timestamps are in Unix EPOCH format. We also provide test customer and price IDs that you can use while in test mode.\n\n## CSV prerequisites![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nBefore you create or download a CSV file, make sure you know the following:\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Customer object** | All customers must have a default [payment method attached to them](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods/attach). Without a default payment method, future subscription payments will fail. If you don’t have a default payment method set for your customers after migrating their data, you have two options:<br><br>*   Obtain the user’s consent or rely on their past payment behavior to determine the default payment method on a per-customer basis.<br>*   Use this [provided script](https://gist.github.com/bsears90/c3f36bfe379dfd13cae749824c5b45ae) to attach the latest payment method to your customers and make it the default method. |\n| **Automatic tax** | If you use Stripe Tax (where you set automatic tax to true), all customers must have either [addresses or postal codes](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/customer-locations) (or †both) per country. Stripe needs this information to calculate taxes for the given subscriptions. |\n| **[`collection_method`](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/create#create_subscription-collection_method)** | If you’re using the `send_invoice` payment method for your subscriptions:<br><br>*   Add email addresses to the required customers.<br>*   Add the [`days_until_due`](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/create#create_subscription-days_until_due) parameter in the migration CSV file to state the validity of [invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices \"invoices\") for each customer. |\n| **Dates** | *   To ensure accurate timing, pay special attention to timezones when you create epoch date-time formats for your migration CSV file.<br>*   For the toolkit, set the [`start_date`](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/object#subscription_object-start_date) with a buffer of at least 24 hours in advance from the CSV upload time. We create a [subscription schedule](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/subscription-schedules) so that you get this buffer time to confirm and verify accuracy. When the start date begins, the subscription changes from scheduled start to live state. |\n| **Coupons** | *   If the subscription schedule or subscription has [billing cycle anchor](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/billing-cycle) in the future and `proration_behavior` [set to](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/prorations#disable-prorations)`none`, updating these objects unsets the coupon. Re-apply the coupon if you make any updates to the subscription schedule or subscription.<br>*   To migrate a subscription with ongoing `discount_behavior`:<br>    *   Set a future phase that removes the coupon at the correct date instead of waiting for an expiration.<br>    *   Create a coupon for each subscription, with the duration being different on each one so they all expire correctly. |\n| **Stripe to Stripe migration** | Users can migrate subscriptions within Stripe accounts. You must input Customer IDs and Price IDs (and both Coupon IDs and Tax IDs, if using them) into the template associated with your destination Stripe account, and not your source Stripe account. The migration tool generates an error if you input IDs associated with your source account. |\n\n## Migration use-cases![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYou can apply the following migration use cases to your own migration, if applicable:\n\n*   [Migrate subscriptions with various pricing models](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/toolkit-reference#various-pricing)\n*   [Migrate subscriptions with different types of payment collection methods](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/toolkit-reference#payment-collection)\n*   [Migrate subscriptions at different stages of the subscription cycle](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/toolkit-reference#subscription-stage)\n*   [Migrate subscriptions with taxes](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/toolkit-reference#subscription-taxes)\n*   [Migrate subscriptions with discounts](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/toolkit-reference#subscription-discounts)\n*   [Migrate subscriptions within Stripe accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/toolkit-reference#within-Stripe-accounts)\n*   [Migrate subscriptions with multiple phases](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/toolkit-reference#multiple-phases)\n\nYou can combine any Stripe-provided CSV template ([Basic](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/import-subscriptions-toolkit#basic), [Multi-price items](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/import-subscriptions-toolkit#multi-price), [Ad-hoc pricing](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/import-subscriptions-toolkit#ad-hoc)) with any of the examples below as needed.\n\n### Migrate subscriptions with various pricing models ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nYou can migrate subscriptions with flat-rate pricing, such as a basic plan at 100 USD per month or an advanced plan at 200 USD per month.

For example, migrate a 100 USD monthly subscription with a last cycle start date of December 25, which hasn’t been paid. Migrate this mid-cycle starting January 1, with a renewal date on the 25th of each month. This creates a prorated invoice from January 1 to January 25 that Stripe can attempt to collect payment for.\n\nTo migrate subscriptions that are in an active cycle but haven’t been paid in the previous system, set `proration_behavior` to `create_prorations` to immediately create an invoice and collect payment. This also enters the subscription into Stripe’s dunning flow, if the payment is still unpaid.\n\n|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **ATTRIBUTE** | customer (required) | start\\_date (required) | price (required) | quantity | metadata.third\\_party\\_sub\\_id | automatic\\_tax | billing\\_cycle\\_anchor | coupon | trial\\_end | proration\\_behavior | collection\\_method | default\\_tax\\_rate | backdate\\_start\\_date | days\\_until\\_due | cancel\\_at\\_period\\_end | add\\_invoice\\_items.0.amount | add\\_invoice\\_items.0.product | add\\_invoice\\_items.0.currency |\n| **FIELD** | cus\\_xxxx1 | 1704067200 | price\\_xxx1 | 1   | subscription\\_1 |     | 1706140800 |     |     | create\\_prorations | charge\\_automatically |     | 1703462400 |     |     |     |     |     |\n\n**Example 5: Migrate subscriptions that need to be canceled at the end of the cycle**.

For example, to migrate a $100 monthly subscription starting January 1, 2024, with a 10% forever discount:\n\n*   Create a 10% coupon in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/tax-rates) (**Product catalog** > **Coupons**).\n*   Use the coupon name in the migration CSV file.\n\n|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **ATTRIBUTE** | customer (required) | start\\_date (required) | price (required) | quantity | metadata.third\\_party\\_sub\\_id | automatic\\_tax | billing\\_cycle\\_anchor | coupon | trial\\_end | proration\\_behavior | collection\\_method | default\\_tax\\_rate | backdate\\_start\\_date | days\\_until\\_due | cancel\\_at\\_period\\_end | add\\_invoice\\_items.0.amount | add\\_invoice\\_items.0.product | add\\_invoice\\_items.0.currency |\n| **FIELD** | cus\\_xxxx1 | 1704067200 | price\\_xxx1 | 1   | subscription\\_1 |     |     | sample\\_coupon |     | none | charge\\_automatically |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |\n\n### Migrate subscriptions within Stripe accounts ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nThe steps to migrate subscriptions from one Stripe account to another are the same as when migrating from a third-party system. Use the [Billing migration toolkit](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/import-subscriptions-toolkit) to migrate subscriptions. You’ll need to export the subscription data for your CSV file from your old Stripe account.\n\n**Example 1 (Basic)**: To create a migration CSV for a Stripe-to-Stripe migration:\n\n1.  Export the subscriptions from the old Stripe account using the Dashboard.\n2.  Use the following CSV example as a reference to map fields between the old and new Stripe accounts.\n\n|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **ATTRIBUTE** | customer (required) | start\\_date (required) | price (required) | quantity | metadata.old\\_Stripe\\_sub\\_id | automatic\\_tax | billing\\_cycle\\_anchor | coupon | trial\\_end | proration\\_behavior | collection\\_method | default\\_tax\\_rate | backdate\\_start\\_date | days\\_until\\_due | cancel\\_at\\_period\\_end |\n| **FIELD** | Export field: Customer ID (from previous account export) | Export field: Current Period End UTC (from previous account export) | Respective price id in the new account | Export field: Quantity (from previous account export) | Export field: id (from previous account export) | TRUE if using Stripe tax in new account, else FALSE | Future billing date in new account | Respective coupon in the new account, if any | Respective trial in the new account, if any | `create_prorations` in case of prorated invoice, else `none` | `charge_automatically` or `send_invoice` | Respective tax rate in the new account, if any | Export field: Start Date UTC (from previous account export) | Specify if using `send_invoice` as collection method | Specify if a subscription is due to be canceled at period end |\n\n### Migrate subscriptions with multiple phases ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nThe migration toolkit doesn’t support adding multiple phases directly to a subscription. We recommend the following approach:\n\n1.  Use the migration toolkit to migrate the initial phase of the subscription.\n2.  After the migration, add the additional phases to the migrated subscription schedules. To do so, call the [update](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscription_schedules/update) endpoint or use the Stripe [Subscriptions](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/subscriptions) Dashboard.\n3.  Adjust the `start_date` of the migration to allow enough time between the scheduled and live status changes. This allows you to make the phase updates before the subscriptions go live.\n\n## Full CSV specification![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n| Attribute | Type | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `customer` **(required)** | Stripe Customer ID | The identifier of the customer to create the subscription for. |\n| `start_date` **(required)** | Timestamp in epoch UNIX format | Determines when to create the subscription. You must provide a value that’s 24 hours (or greater) into the future. In test mode, you can set this to 1 hour in the future. |\n| `price` **(required)** | Stripe Price ID | Must be a recurring price. If migrating multiple items, use `items.x.{price, quantity}` format instead. Ad-hoc prices are also supported with `adhoc_items.x.{amount, interval, product, currency}`. |\n| `quantity` | Number | Determines quantity of a subscription. By default, each subscription is for one product, but Stripe allows you to subscribe a customer to multiple quantities of an item. |\n| `items.x.price` **(required)** | Stripe Price ID | The ID of the price object. Must be a recurring price. |\n| `items.x.quantity` | Number | Determines quantity of a subscription. By default, each subscription is for one product, but Stripe allows you to subscribe a customer to multiple quantities of an item. |\n| `adhoc_items.x.amount` **(required)** | Integer | A positive integer in cents (or 0 for a free price). For more information, see [Create a subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/create#create_subscription-items-price_data). |\n| `adhoc_items.x.product` **(required)** | Stripe Product ID | The identifier of the product that belongs with the ad-hoc price. |\n| `adhoc_items.x.interval` **(required)** | `day`, `week`, `month` or `year` | The billing frequency. |\n| `adhoc_items.x.currency` **(required)** | String | A three-letter ISO currency code, in lowercase, for a [supported currency](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies). |\n| `adhoc_items.x.quantity` | Number | Determines quantity of a subscription. By default, each subscription is for one product, but Stripe allows you to subscribe a customer to multiple quantities of an item. |\n| `metadata_source` | String | If you’re doing a Stripe-to-Stripe migration, enter `internal:Stripe`. |\n| `metadata_*` | String | Attach these key-value pairs to an object. This is useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format. |\n| `automatic_tax` | Boolean | Specify `true` to use automatic tax settings by Stripe Tax. |\n| `coupon` | Stripe Coupon ID | The identifier of the coupon to apply to this subscription. |\n| `trial_end` | Timestamp | Sets the phase to trialing from the start date to the `trial_end` date. You must specify a value that’s before the cycle/phase end date, and you can’t combine it with the trial. |\n| `proration_behavior` | `create_prorations` or `none` | Determines if the subscription creates prorations after migration. The default value is `create_prorations`. |\n| `collection_method` | `charge_automatically` or `send_invoice` | When charging automatically, Stripe attempts to pay the underlying subscription at the end of each billing cycle using the default source attached to the customer. The default value is `charge_automatically`. When sending an invoice, Stripe emails your customer an invoice with payment instructions, and marks the subscription as active. If using `send_invoice`, you must set `days_until_due`. |\n| `default_tax_rate` | Stripe Tax ID | Sets the subscription’s `default_tax_rates`. This also determines the invoice’s `default_tax_rates` for any invoices issued by the subscription during this phase. This value is incompatible with `automatic_tax`. |\n| `backdate_start_date` | Timestamp in epoch UNIX format | Determines the `start_date` of the created subscription, which must occur in the past. If set, you must specify `none` for the `proration_behavior`. Doing so prevents the creation of a prorated invoice for the time between `backdate_start_date` and actual `start_date`. For more details, see [backdating no charge](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/backdating#backdating-no-charge). |\n| `billing_cycle_anchor` | Timestamp | Determines the future dates of when to bill the subscription to the customer. |\n| `days_until_due` | Integer | The number of days from when the invoice is created until it’s due. This is required and valid only for invoices with `collection_method` set to `send_invoice`. |\n| `cancel_at_period_end` | Boolean | Specify `true` to cancel a subscription at the end of the period. |",

  "markdown": "# Set up future payments using Elements and Link\n\n## Save your Link customers' details and charge them later.\n\nThis guide walks you through how to accept payments with [Link](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link/what-is-link) using the [Setup Intents API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_intents) and either the [Payment Element](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-element) or [Link Authentication Element](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/elements/link-authentication-element).\n\nThere are three ways you can secure a customer email address for Link authentication and enrollment:\n\n*   **Pass in an email address:** You can pass an email address to the Payment Element using [defaultValues](https://docs.stripe.com/js/elements_object/create_payment_element#payment_element_create-options-defaultValues). If you’re already collecting the email address and or customer’s phone number in the checkout flow, we recommend this approach.\n*   **Collect an email address:** You can collect an email address directly in the Payment Element. If you’re not collecting the email address anywhere in the checkout flow, we recommend this approach.\n*   **Link Authentication Element:** You can use the Link Authentication Element to create a single email input field for both email collection and Link authentication. We recommend doing this if you use the [Address Element](https://docs.stripe.com/elements/address-element).\n\n![Authenticate or enroll with Link directly in the Payment Element during checkout](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/link-in-pe.2efb5138a4708b781b8a913ebddd9aba.png)\n\nCollect a customer email address for Link authentication or enrollment\n\n[](#set-up-stripe)\n\nFirst, [create a Stripe account](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register) or [sign in](https://dashboard.stripe.com/login).\n\nUse our official libraries to access the Stripe API from your application:\n\n`# Available as a gem sudo gem install stripe`\n\n`# If you use bundler, you can add this line to your Gemfile gem 'stripe'`\n\n[](#create-customer)\n\nTo set up a payment method for future payments, you must attach it to a [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers \"Customers\"). Create a `Customer` object when your customer creates an account with your business. `Customer` objects allow for reusing payment methods and tracking across multiple payments.\n\n`curl -X POST https://api.stripe.com/v1/customers \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\"`\n\n[](#web-create-intent)\n\n#### Note\n\nA [SetupIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_intents) is an object that represents your intent to set up a customer’s payment method for future payments during a session and tracks the status of that session. Create a SetupIntent on your server with `link` and the other payment methods you want to support:\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/setup_intents \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d customer={{CUSTOMER_ID}} \\   -d \"payment_method_types[]\"=card \\  -d \"payment_method_types[]\"=link`\n\nTo see how to set up other payment methods, see the [Set up future payments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/save-and-reuse) guide.\n\n### Retrieve the client secret![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe SetupIntent includes a [client secret](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-client_secret \"PaymentIntent client secret\") that the client side uses to securely complete the payment process. You can use different approaches to pass the client secret to the client side.\n\nRetrieve the client secret from an endpoint on your server, using the browser’s `fetch` function. This approach is best if your client side is a single-page application, particularly one built with a modern frontend framework like React. Create the server endpoint that serves the client secret:\n\n`get '/secret' do   intent = # ... Create or retrieve the SetupIntent   {client_secret: intent.client_secret}.to_json end`\n\nAnd then fetch the client secret with JavaScript on the client side:\n\n`(async () => {   const response = await fetch('/secret');   const {client_secret: clientSecret} = await response.json();   // Render the form using the clientSecret })();`\n\n[](#design-your-integration)\n\nLink authenticates a customer by using their email address. Depending on your checkout flow, you have the following options: pass an email to the Payment Element, collect it directly within the Payment Element, or use the Link Authentication Element. Of these, Stripe recommends passing a customer email address to the Payment Element if available.\n\nIf _any_ of the following apply to you:\n\n*   You want a single, optimized component for email collection and Link authentication.\n*   You need to collect a shipping address from your customer.\n\nThen use the integration flow that implements these elements: the Link Authentication Element, Payment Element and optional Address Element.\n\nA Link-enabled checkout page has the Link Authentication Element at the beginning, followed by the Address Element, and the Payment Element at the end. You can also display the Link Authentication Element on separate pages, in this same order, for multi-page checkout flows.\n\n![Create a payment form using multiple Elements](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/link-with-elements.f60af275f69b6e6e73c766d1f9928457.png)\n\nCreate a payment form using multiple Elements\n\nThe integration works as follows:\n\n[](#web-collect-payment-details)\n\nNow you can set up your custom payment form with the Elements prebuilt UI components. Your payment page address must start with `https://` rather than `http://` for your integration to work. You can test your integration without using HTTPS. [Enable HTTPS](https://docs.stripe.com/security/guide#tls) when you’re ready to accept live payments.\n\nThe Link Authentication Element renders an email address input. When Link matches a customer email with an existing Link account, it sends the customer a secure, one-time code to their phone to authenticate. If the customer successfully authenticates, Stripe displays their Link-saved addresses and payment methods automatically for them to use.\n\nThis integration also creates the Payment Element, which renders a dynamic form that allows your customer to pick a payment method type. The form automatically collects all necessary payments details for the payment method type selected by the customer. The Payment Element also handles the display of Link-saved payment methods for authenticated customers.\n\n### Set up Stripe Elements ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nInstall React Stripe.js and the Stripe.js loader from the [npm public registry](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@stripe/react-stripe-js).\n\n`npm install --save @stripe/react-stripe-js @stripe/stripe-js`\n\nOn your payment page, wrap your payment form with the `Elements` component, passing the [client secret](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-client_secret) from [the previous step](#web-create-intent). ​​If you already collect the customer’s email in another part of your form, replace your existing input with the `linkAuthenticationElement​`.\n\nIf you don’t collect email, add the `linkAuthenticationElement​` to your checkout flow. You must place the `linkAuthenticationElement` before the `ShippingAddressElement` (optional if you collect shipping addresses) and the `PaymentElement` for Link to autofill Link-saved details for your customer in the `ShippingAddressElement` and `PaymentElement`. You can also pass in the [appearance option](https://docs.stripe.com/elements/appearance-api), customizing the Elements to match the design of your site.\n\nIf you have the customer’s email, pass it to the `defaultValues` option of the `linkAuthenticationElement`. This prefills their email address and initiates the Link authentication process.\n\nIf you have other customer information, pass it to the `defaultValues.billingDetails` object for the `PaymentElement`. Prefilling as much information as possible simplifies Link account creation and reuse for your customers.\n\nThen, render the `linkAuthenticationElement` and `PaymentElement` components in your payment form:\n\n`import {loadStripe} from \"@stripe/stripe-js\"; import {   Elements,   LinkAuthenticationElement,   PaymentElement, } from \"@stripe/react-stripe-js\";  const stripe = loadStripe(`\n\n`'pk_test_TYooMQauvdEDq54NiTphI7jx'`\n\n`);  // Customize the appearance of Elements using the Appearance API. const appearance = {/* ... */};  // Enable the skeleton loader UI for the optimal loading experience. const loader = 'auto';`\n\nThe `linkAuthenticationElement`, `PaymentElement`, and `ShippingAddressElement` don’t need to be on the same page. If you have a process where customer contact information, shipping details, and payment details display to the customer in separate steps, you can display each Element in the appropriate step or page. Include the `linkAuthenticationElement` as the email input form in the contact info collection step to make sure the customer can take full advantage of the shipping and payment autofill provided by Link.\n\nIf you collect your customer’s email with the Link Authentication Element early in the checkout flow, you don’t need to show it again on the shipping or payment pages.\n\n### Retrieve an email address ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nYou can retrieve the email address details using the `onChange` prop on the `linkAuthenticationElement` component. The `onChange` handler fires whenever the user updates the email field, or when a saved customer email is autofilled.\n\n`<linkAuthenticationElement onChange={(event) => {   setEmail(event.value.email); }} />`\n\n### Prefill a customer email address ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nThe Link Authentication Element accepts an email address. Providing a customer’s email address triggers the Link authentication flow as soon as the customer lands on the payment page using the `defaultValues` option.\n\n`<linkAuthenticationElement options={{defaultValues: {email: 'foo@bar.com'}}}/>`\n\n[](#web-submit-payment)\n\nUse [stripe.confirmSetup](https://docs.stripe.com/js/setup_intents/confirm_setup) to complete the setup with the details you collected. Provide a [return\\_url](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_intents/create#create_setup_intent-return_url) to this function so that Stripe can redirect users after they complete their setup. When a payment is successful, Stripe immediately redirects Link and card payments to the `return_url`.\n\n`import {loadStripe} from \"@stripe/stripe-js\"; import {   useStripe,   useElements,   Elements,   LinkAuthenticationElement,   PaymentElement,   // If collecting shipping   AddressElement, } from \"@stripe/react-stripe-js\";  const stripe = loadStripe(`\n\n`'pk_test_TYooMQauvdEDq54NiTphI7jx'`\n\n`);  const appearance = {/* ... */};  // Enable the skeleton loader UI for the optimal loading experience. const loader = 'auto';  const CheckoutPage =({clientSecret}) => (   <Elements stripe={stripe} options={{clientSecret, appearance, loader}}>     <CheckoutForm />   </Elements> );  export default function CheckoutForm() {   const stripe = useStripe();   const elements = useElements();    const handleSubmit = async (event) => {     event.preventDefault();      const {error} = await stripe.confirmSetup({       elements,       confirmParams: {         return_url: \"[https://example.com/order/123/complete](https://example.com/order/123/complete)\",       },     });      if (error) {       // handle error     }   };    return (     <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>       <h3>Contact info</h3>       <LinkAuthenticationElement />       {/* If collecting shipping */}       <h3>Shipping</h3>       <AddressElement options={{mode: 'shipping', allowedCountries: ['US']}} />       <h3>Payment</h3>       <PaymentElement />        <button type=\"submit\">Submit</button>     </form>   ); }`\n\n[](#charge-saved-payment-method)\n\nWhen you’re ready to charge your customer, use the Customer and PaymentMethod IDs to create a PaymentIntent. To find a payment method to charge, list the payment methods associated with your customer.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/payment_methods \\   -u` \n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`: \\   -d \"customer\"=\"{{CUSTOMER_ID}}\" \\   -d \"type\"=\"link\" \\   -G`\n\nWhen you have the Customer and PaymentMethod IDs, create a PaymentIntent with the amount and currency of the payment with these parameters:\n\n*   Set the value of the PaymentIntent’s [confirm](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-confirm) property to `true`, which causes confirmation to occur immediately when the PaymentIntent is created.\n*   Set [payment\\_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api#create_payment_intent-payment_method) to the ID of the PaymentMethod\n*   Set [customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api#create_payment_intent-customer) to the ID of the Customer.\n*   Set [off\\_session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/confirm#confirm_payment_intent-off_session) to `true`. This causes the PaymentIntent to send an error if authentication is required when your customer isn’t actively using your site or app.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/payment_intents \\   -u` \n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n``: \\   -d amount=1099 \\   -d currency=usd \\   # In the latest version of the API, specifying the `automatic_payment_methods` parameter is optional because Stripe enables its functionality by default.   -d \"automatic_payment_methods[enabled]\"=true \\   -d customer=\"{{CUSTOMER_ID}}\" \\   -d payment_method=\"{{PAYMENT_METHOD_ID}}\" \\   -d return_url=\"https://example.com/order/123/complete\" \\   -d off_session=true \\   -d confirm=true``\n\n[](#web-test-the-integration)\n\n#### Caution\n\nDon’t store real user data in [test mode](https://docs.stripe.com/test-mode \"test mode\") Link accounts. Treat them as if they’re publicly available, because these test accounts are associated with your publishable key.\n\nCurrently, Link only works with credit cards, debit cards, and qualified US bank account purchases. Link requires [domain registration](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/pmd-registration).\n\nYou can create test mode accounts for Link using any valid email address. The following table shows the fixed one-time passcode values that Stripe accepts for authenticating test mode accounts:\n\n| Value | Outcome |\n| --- | --- |\n| Any other 6 digits not listed below | Success |\n| 000001 | Error, code invalid |\n| 000002 | Error, code expired |\n| 000003 | Error, max attempts exceeded |\n\nFor testing specific payment methods, refer to the [Payment Element testing examples](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=web#additional-testing-resources).\n\n### Multiple funding sources![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nAs Stripe adds additional funding source support, you don’t need to update your integration. Stripe automatically supports them with the same transaction settlement time and guarantees as card and bank account payments.\n\n### Card authentication and 3D Secure![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nLink supports [3D Secure 2 (3DS2)](https://stripe.com/guides/3d-secure-2 \"3D Secure 2 (3DS2)\") authentication for card payments. 3DS2 requires customers to complete an additional verification step with the card issuer when paying. Payments that have been successfully authenticated using 3D Secure are covered by a liability shift.\n\nTo trigger 3DS2 authentication challenge flows with Link in test mode, use the following test card with any CVC, postal code, and future expiration date: .\n\nIn test mode, the authentication process displays a mock authentication page. On that page, you can either authorize or cancel the payment. Authorizing the payment simulates successful authentication and redirects you to the specified return URL. Clicking the **Failure** button simulates an unsuccessful attempt at authentication.\n\nFor more details, refer to the [3D Secure authentication page](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure).\n\n#### Note\n\nWhen testing 3DS flows, only test cards for 3DS2 will trigger authentication on Link.\n\n[](#disclose-cookies)\n\nStripe collects information on customer interactions with Elements to provide services to you, prevent fraud, and improve its services.

  "markdown": "# Enable other businesses to accept payments directly\n\nThis guide covers letting your users accept payments, moving a portion of your users’ earnings into your balance, and paying out the remainder to your users’ bank accounts. To illustrate these concepts, we’ll use an example platform that lets businesses build their own online stores.\n\n## Prerequisites![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n1.  [Register your platform](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/tasklist).\n2.  Add business details to [activate your account](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/onboarding).\n3.  [Complete your platform profile](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/settings/profile).\n4.  [Customize your brand settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect/stripe-dashboard/branding). Add a business name, icon, and brand color.\n\n[](#setup)\n\nInstall Stripe’s official libraries so you can access the API from your application:\n\n`# Available as a gem sudo gem install stripe`\n\n`# If you use bundler, you can add this line to your Gemfile gem 'stripe'`\n\n[](#create-account)\n\nWhen a user (seller or service provider) signs up on your platform, create a user [Account](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts) (referred to as a _connected account_) so you can accept payments and move funds to their bank account. Connected accounts represent your user in Stripe’s API and help facilitate the collection of onboarding requirements so Stripe can verify the user’s identity. In our store builder example, the connected account represents the business setting up their Internet store.\n\n![Screenshot of Connect Onboarding form](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/Kavholm-Seamless-Standard.78b64d90c0bf87130c8b6ba1ef53df7f.png)\n\n### Create a connected account and prefill information ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nUse the `/v1/accounts` API to [create](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/create) a connected account. You can create the connected account by using the [default connected account parameters](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/migrate-to-controller-properties), or by specifying the account type.\n\n`curl -X POST https://api.stripe.com/v1/accounts \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\"`\n\nIf you’ve already collected information for your connected accounts, you can prefill that information on the account object. You can prefill any account information, including personal and business information, external account information, and so on.\n\nConnect Onboarding doesn’t ask for the prefilled information. However, it does ask the account holder to confirm the prefilled information before accepting the [Connect service agreement](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/service-agreement-types).\n\nWhen testing your integration, prefill account information using [test data](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/testing).\n\n### Create an account link ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nYou can create an account link by calling the [Account Links](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_links) API with the following parameters:\n\n*   `account`\n*   `refresh_url`\n*   `return_url`\n*   `type` = `account_onboarding`\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/account_links \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d account=  {{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}   \\   --data-urlencode refresh_url=\"[https://example.com/reauth](https://example.com/reauth)\" \\   --data-urlencode return_url=\"[https://example.com/return](https://example.com/return)\" \\  -d type=account_onboarding`\n\n### Redirect your user to the account link URL ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nThe response to your [Account Links](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_links) request includes a value for the key `url`. Redirect to this link to send your user into the flow. Account Links are temporary and are single-use only because they grant access to the connected account user’s personal information. Authenticate the user in your application before redirecting them to this URL. If you want to prefill information, you must do so before generating the account link. After you create the account link, you won’t be able to read or write information for the account.\n\n#### Security tip\n\nDon’t email, text, or otherwise send account link URLs outside of your platform application. Instead, provide them to the authenticated account holder within your application.\n\n### Handle the user returning to your platform ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nConnect Onboarding requires you to pass both a `return_url` and `refresh_url` to handle all cases where the user is redirected to your platform. It’s important that you implement these correctly to provide the best experience for your user.\n\n#### Note\n\nYou can use HTTP for your `return_url` and `refresh_url` while in test mode (for example, to test with localhost), but live mode only accepts HTTPS. Be sure to swap testing URLs for HTTPS URLs before going live.\n\n#### return\\_url![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nStripe issues a redirect to this URL when the user completes the Connect Onboarding flow. This doesn’t mean that all information has been collected or that there are no outstanding requirements on the account. This only means the flow was entered and exited properly.\n\nNo state is passed through this URL. After a user is redirected to your `return_url`, check the state of the `details_submitted` parameter on their account by doing either of the following:\n\n*   Listening to `account.updated` webhooks\n*   Calling the [Accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts) API and inspecting the returned object\n\n#### refresh\\_url![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYour user is redirected to the `refresh_url` in these cases:\n\n*   The link is expired (a few minutes went by since the link was created)\n*   The user already visited the link (the user refreshed the page or clicked back or forward in the browser)\n*   Your platform is no longer able to access the account\n*   The account has been rejected\n\nYour `refresh_url` should trigger a method on your server to call [Account Links](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_links) again with the same parameters, and redirect the user to the Connect Onboarding flow to create a seamless experience.\n\n### Handle users that haven’t completed onboarding ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nIf a user is redirected to your `return_url`, they might not have completed the onboarding process. Use the `/v1/accounts` endpoint to retrieve the user’s account and check for `charges_enabled`. If the account isn’t fully onboarded, provide UI prompts to allow the user to continue onboarding later. The user can complete their account activation through a new account link (generated by your integration). To see if they’ve completed the onboarding process, check the state of the `details_submitted` parameter on their account.\n\n[](#enable-payment-methods)\n\nView your [payment methods settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect/payment_methods) and enable the payment methods you want to support. Card payments are enabled by default but you can enable and disable payment methods as needed. This guide assumes Bancontact, credit cards, EPS, giropay, iDEAL, Przelewy24, SEPA Direct Debit, and Sofort are enabled.\n\nBefore the payment form is displayed, Stripe evaluates the currency, payment method restrictions, and other parameters to determine the list of supported payment methods. Payment methods that increase conversion and that are most relevant to the currency and customer’s location are prioritized. Lower priority payment methods are hidden in an overflow menu.\n\n[](#accept-payment)\n\nEmbed [Stripe Checkout](https://stripe.com/payments/checkout) as a payment form directly on your website or redirect users to a Stripe-hosted page to accept payments. Checkout supports multiple payment methods and automatically shows the most relevant ones to your customer You can also use the Payment Element, a prebuilt UI component that is embedded as an iframe in your payment form, to accept multiple payment methods with a single frontend integration.\n\n### Create a Checkout Session Client-side Server-side![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nA Checkout Session controls what your customer sees in the embeddable payment form such as line items, the order amount and currency, and acceptable payment methods. When performing direct charges, Checkout uses the connected account’s branding settings. See the [Customize branding](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges?platform=web&ui=stripe-hosted#branding) section for more information.\n\nUnlike destination charges and separate charges and transfers, users (connected accounts) are responsible for handling disputes on direct charges—it’s not the responsibility of the platform.\n\nOn your server, make the following call to the Stripe API. After creating a Checkout Session, redirect your customer to the [URL](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/object#checkout_session_object-url) returned in the response.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/checkout/sessions \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -H \"Stripe-Account:   {{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}  \" \\  -d mode=payment \\  -d \"line_items[0][price]\"=  {{PRICE_ID}}   \\  -d \"line_items[0][quantity]\"=1 \\  -d \"payment_intent_data[application_fee_amount]\"=123 \\   --data-urlencode success_url=\"[https://example.com/success](https://example.com/success)\" \\   --data-urlencode cancel_url=\"[https://example.com/cancel](https://example.com/cancel)\"`\n\n*   `line_items` - This argument represents items that your customer is purchasing and that will show up in the hosted user interface.\n*   `success_url` - This argument redirects a user after they complete a payment.\n*   `cancel_url` - This argument redirects a user after they click cancel.\n*   `Stripe-Account` - This header indicates a [direct charge](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges) for your connected account. With direct charges, the connected account is responsible for Stripe fees, refunds, and chargebacks. The connected account’s branding is used in Checkout, which allows their customers to feel like they’re interacting directly with the merchant instead of your platform.\n*   (Optional) `payment_intent_data[application_fee_amount]` - This argument specifies the amount your platform plans to take from the transaction. After the payment is processed on the connected account, the `application_fee_amount` is transferred to the platform and the Stripe fee is deducted from the connected account’s balance.\n\n![Account creation flow](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/direct_charges.a2a8b68037ac95fe22140d6dde9740d3.svg)\n\n### Handle post-payment events Server-side![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nStripe sends a [checkout.session.completed](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-checkout.session.completed) event when the payment completes. [Use a webhook to receive these events](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks/quickstart) and run actions, like sending an order confirmation email to your customer, logging the sale in a database, or starting a shipping workflow.\n\nListen for these events rather than waiting on a callback from the client. On the client, the customer could close the browser window or quit the app before the callback executes. Some payment methods also take 2-14 days for payment confirmation. Setting up your integration to listen for asynchronous events enables you to accept multiple [payment methods](https://stripe.com/payments/payment-methods-guide) with a single integration.\n\nIn addition to handling the `checkout.session.completed` event, we recommend handling two other events when collecting payments with Checkout:\n\nThese events all include the [Checkout Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions) object. After the payment succeeds, the underlying [PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents \"Payment Intents API\") status changes from `processing` to `succeeded`.\n\n[](#testing)\n\nTest your account creation flow by [creating accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/testing#creating-accounts) and [using OAuth](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/testing#using-oauth). Test your **Payment methods** settings for your connected accounts by logging into one of your test accounts and navigating to the [Payment methods settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods). Test your checkout flow with your test keys and a test account. You can use our [test cards](https://docs.stripe.com/testing) to test your payments flow and simulate various payment outcomes.\n\nBy default, any charge that you create for a connected account accumulates in the connected account’s [Stripe balance](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-balances) and is paid out on a daily rolling basis. Connected accounts can manage their own payout schedules in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payouts).",

By visiting the session’s URL, the customer can manage their subscriptions and billing details. For security reasons, sessions are short-lived and will expire if the customer does not visit the URL. Create sessions on-demand when customers intend to manage their subscriptions and billing details.\n\nRelated guide: [Customer management](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management)\n\n## [Invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices)\n\nInvoices are statements of amounts owed by a customer, and are either generated one-off, or generated periodically from a subscription.\n\nThey contain [invoice items](#invoiceitems), and proration adjustments that may be caused by subscription upgrades/downgrades (if necessary).\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed through automatic charges, Stripe automatically finalizes your invoice and attempts payment. Note that finalizing the invoice, [when automatic](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/automatic-advancement-collection), does not happen immediately as the invoice is created. Stripe waits until one hour after the last webhook was successfully sent (or the last webhook timed out after failing). If you (and the platforms you may have connected to) have no webhooks configured, Stripe waits one hour after creation to finalize the invoice.\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed by sending an email, then based on your [email settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/billing/automatic), Stripe will email the invoice to your customer and await payment. These emails can contain a link to a hosted page to pay the invoice.\n\nStripe applies any customer credit on the account before determining the amount due for the invoice (i.e., the amount that will be actually charged). If the amount due for the invoice is less than Stripe’s [minimum allowed charge per currency](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts), the invoice is automatically marked paid, and we add the amount due to the customer’s credit balance which is applied to the next invoice.\n\nMore details on the customer’s credit balance are [here](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/customer/balance).\n\nRelated guide: [Send invoices to customers](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/invoices/sending)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create)[POST/v1/invoices/create\\_preview](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create_preview)[POST/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/lines/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_line)[GET/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/retrieve)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming)[GET/v1/invoices/:id/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming_invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/list)[DELETE/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/delete)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/add\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/add_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/remove\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/remove_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/update\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/finalize](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/finalize)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/mark\\_uncollectible](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/mark_uncollectible)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/pay](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/pay)[GET/v1/invoices/search](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/search)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/send](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/send)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/void](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/void)\n\n## [Meter Events](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event)\n\nA billing meter event represents a customer’s usage of a product. Meter events are used to bill a customer based on their usage. Meter events are associated with billing meters, which define the shape of the event’s payload and how those events are aggregated for billing.\n\n## [Meter Event Adjustment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_adjustment)\n\nA billing meter event adjustment is a resource that allows you to cancel a meter event. For example, you might create a billing meter event adjustment to cancel a meter event that was created in error or attached to the wrong customer.\n\n## [Meter Event Summary](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_summary)\n\nA billing meter event summary represents an aggregated view of a customer’s billing meter events within a specified timeframe. It indicates how much usage was accrued by a customer for that period.\n\n## [Plans](https://docs.stripe.com/api/plans)\n\nYou can now model subscriptions more flexibly using the [Prices API](#prices). It replaces the Plans API and is backwards compatible to simplify your migration.\n\nPlans define the base price, currency, and billing cycle for recurring purchases of products. [Products](#products) help you track inventory or provisioning, and plans help you track pricing. Different physical goods or levels of service should be represented by products, and pricing options should be represented by plans. This approach lets you change prices without having to change your provisioning scheme.\n\nFor example, you might have a single “gold” product that has plans for $10/month, $100/year, €9/month, and €90/year.\n\nRelated guides: [Set up a subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/set-up-subscription) and more about [products and prices](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/overview).\n\n## [Tax IDs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_create)[POST/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/create)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_retrieve)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/retrieve)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_list)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/list)[DELETE/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_delete)[DELETE/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/delete)\n\n## [Account Links](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_links)\n\nAccount Links are the means by which a Connect platform grants a connected account permission to access Stripe-hosted applications, such as Connect Onboarding.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect Onboarding](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom/hosted-onboarding)\n\n## [Account Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_sessions)\n\nAn AccountSession allows a Connect platform to grant access to a connected account in Connect embedded components.\n\nWe recommend that you create an AccountSession each time you need to display an embedded component to your user. Do not save AccountSessions to your database as they expire relatively quickly, and cannot be used more than once.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect embedded components](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-connect-embedded-components)\n\n## [Application Fees](https://docs.stripe.com/api/application_fees)\n\nWhen you collect a transaction fee on top of a charge made for your user (using [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)), an `Application Fee` object is created in your account. You can list, retrieve, and refund application fees.\n\nRelated guide: [Collecting application fees](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges#collect-fees)\n\n## [Country Specs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/country_specs)\n\nStripe needs to collect certain pieces of information about each account created. These requirements can differ depending on the account’s country. The Country Specs API makes these rules available to your integration.\n\nYou can also view the information from this API call as [an online guide](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information).\n\n## [Person](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/create)[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/update)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/retrieve)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/list)[DELETE/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/delete)\n\n## [Transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/transfers)\n\nA `Transfer` object is created when you move funds between Stripe accounts as part of Connect.\n\nBefore April 6, 2017, transfers also represented movement of funds from a Stripe account to a card or bank account. This behavior has since been split out into a [Payout](#payout_object) object, with corresponding payout endpoints. For more information, read about the [transfer/payout split](https://docs.stripe.com/transfer-payout-split).\n\nRelated guide: [Creating separate charges and transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n\n## [Secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/secret_management)\n\nSecret Store is an API that allows Stripe Apps developers to securely persist secrets for use by UI Extensions and app backends.\n\nThe primary resource in Secret Store is a `secret`. Other apps can’t view secrets created by an app. Additionally, secrets are scoped to provide further permission control.\n\nAll Dashboard users and the app backend share `account` scoped secrets. Use the `account` scope for secrets that don’t change per-user, like a third-party API key.\n\nA `user` scoped secret is accessible by the app backend and one specific Dashboard user. Use the `user` scope for per-user secrets like per-user OAuth tokens, where different users might have different permissions.\n\nRelated guide: [Store data between page reloads](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/store-auth-data-custom-objects)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[GET/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/list)[POST/v1/apps/secrets/delete](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/delete)[GET/v1/apps/secrets/find](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/find)[POST/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/set)\n\n## [Reviews](https://docs.stripe.com/api/radar/reviews)\n\nReviews can be used to supplement automated fraud detection with human expertise.\n\nLearn more about [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar) and reviewing payments [here](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/reviews).\n\n## [Authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/update)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/list)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/approve](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/approve)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/decline](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/decline)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_create)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/capture](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_capture)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/expire](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_expire)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/finalize\\_amount](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_finalize_amount)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/increment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_increment)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/fraud\\_challenges/respond](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/respond_to_fraud_challenges)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/reverse](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_reverse)\n\n## [Cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/create)[POST/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/update)[GET/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/list)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/deliver](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_deliver)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/fail](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_fail)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/return](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_return)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/ship](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_ship)\n\n## [Physical Bundles](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/physical_bundles)\n\nA Physical Bundle represents the bundle of physical items - card stock, carrier letter, and envelope - that is shipped to a cardholder when you create a physical card.\n\n## [Reader](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/terminal/readers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/create)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/update)[GET/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/retrieve)[GET/v1/terminal/readers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/list)[DELETE/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/delete)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/cancel\\_action](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/cancel_action)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/collect\\_inputs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/collect_inputs)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/confirm\\_payment\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/confirm_payment_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/collect\\_payment\\_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/collect_payment_method)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/process\\_payment\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/process_payment_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/process\\_setup\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/process_setup_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/refund\\_payment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/refund_payment)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/set\\_reader\\_display](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/set_reader_display)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/terminal/readers/:id/present\\_payment\\_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/present_payment_method)\n\n## [Terminal Hardware Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_products)Preview feature\n\nA TerminalHardwareProduct is a category of hardware devices that are generally similar, but may have variations depending on the country it’s shipped to.\n\nTerminalHardwareSKUs represent variations within the same Product (for example, a country specific device). For example, WisePOS E is a TerminalHardwareProduct and a WisePOS E - US and WisePOS E - UK are TerminalHardwareSKUs.\n\n## [Terminal Hardware SKU](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_skus)Preview feature\n\nA TerminalHardwareSKU represents a SKU for Terminal hardware. A SKU is a representation of a product available for purchase, containing information such as the name, price, and images.\n\n## [Transaction Entries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/transaction_entries)\n\nTransactionEntries represent individual units of money movements within a single [Transaction](#transactions).\n\n## [Scheduled Queries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/sigma/scheduled_queries)\n\nIf you have [scheduled a Sigma query](https://docs.stripe.com/sigma/scheduled-queries), you’ll receive a `sigma.scheduled_query_run.created` webhook each time the query runs. The webhook contains a `ScheduledQueryRun` object, which you can use to retrieve the query results.\n\n## [Report Types](https://docs.stripe.com/api/reporting/report_type)\n\nThe Report Type resource corresponds to a particular type of report, such as the “Activity summary” or “Itemized payouts” reports. These objects are identified by an ID belonging to a set of enumerated values. See [API Access to Reports documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/reporting/statements/api) for those Report Type IDs, along with required and optional parameters.\n\nNote that certain report types can only be run based on your live-mode data (not test-mode data), and will error when queried without a [live-mode API key](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#test-live-modes).\n\n## [Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/financial_connections/sessions)\n\nA Financial Connections Session is the secure way to programmatically launch the client-side Stripe.js modal that lets your users link their accounts.\n\n## [Verification Report](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_reports)\n\nA VerificationReport is the result of an attempt to collect and verify data from a user. The collection of verification checks performed is determined from the `type` and `options` parameters used. You can find the result of each verification check performed in the appropriate sub-resource: `document`, `id_number`, `selfie`.\n\nEach VerificationReport contains a copy of any data collected by the user as well as reference IDs which can be used to access collected images through the [FileUpload](https://docs.stripe.com/api/files) API. To configure and create VerificationReports, use the [VerificationSession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_sessions) API.\n\nRelated guide: [Accessing verification results](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verification-sessions#results).\n\n## [Crypto Onramp Quotes](https://docs.stripe.com/api/crypto/onramp_quotes)\n\nCrypto Onramp Quotes are estimated quotes for onramp conversions into all the different cryptocurrencies on different networks. The Quotes API allows you to display quotes in your product UI before directing the user to the onramp widget.\n\nRelated guide: [Quotes API](https://docs.stripe.com/crypto/quotes-api)\n\n## [Climate Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/climate/product)\n\nA Climate product represents a type of carbon removal unit available for reservation. You can retrieve it to see the current price and availability.\n\n## [Forwarding Request](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/request)\n\nInstructs Stripe to make a request on your behalf using the destination URL. The destination URL is activated by Stripe at the time of onboarding. Stripe verifies requests with your credentials provided during onboarding, and injects card details from the payment\\_method into the request.\n\nStripe redacts all sensitive fields and headers, including authentication credentials and card numbers, before storing the request and response data in the forwarding Request object, which are subject to a 30-day retention period.\n\nYou can provide a Stripe idempotency key to make sure that requests with the same key result in only one outbound request. The Stripe idempotency key provided should be unique and different from any idempotency keys provided on the underlying third-party request.\n\nForwarding Requests are synchronous requests that return a response or time out according to Stripe’s limits.\n\nRelated guide: [Forward card details to third-party API endpoints](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/forwarding).\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/create)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/retrieve)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/list)",

If you’ve been processing new transactions on Stripe during the migration, you might already have some customers in Stripe. Map imported payment data to these existing Stripe customers to avoid creating duplicates.\n\nAfter you submit the migration intake form, reply in the same email thread with a CSV file that includes two columns:\n\n*   **old\\_customer\\_id**: The unique identifier from your former processor.\n*   **stripe\\_customer\\_id**: The corresponding Stripe customer ID in the `cus_xxxx` format.\n\nTo download a list of customers with their Stripe IDs:\n\n1.

Mapping doesn’t overwrite any information already present in the customer’s record. Rather, it appends data for any new cards that aren’t already included without altering the customer level information displayed in the Dashboard. If the data file flags a card as the default card, it overrides any previously set default cards in the Dashboard.",

  "markdown": "# Server-side integration | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Set up your Stripe back-end integration.\n\nTo set up an optimal backend integration, you must authenticate to Stripe, learn API request best practices, and appropriately configure your webhooks.\n\n## Authenticate to Stripe ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nStripe provides authentication through API key. It’s also possible to create [restricted access keys](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#limit-access) to further control access to specific resources. You can use the [secret and publishable API keys](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#obtain-api-keys) to create tokens, but need secret keys for any server-side authentication.\n\nHere’s an example API call:\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/balance \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\"`\n\n[](#API-requests-best-practices)\n\nStripe recommends adding an [idempotency key](https://docs.stripe.com/api/idempotent_requests) to all POST requests. Make sure that the key is unique, such as a universally unique identifier (UUID) or a combination of customer ID and order ID. These keys allow you to safely retry requests if you encounter a network error.\n\n### Customer objects: storing payment details![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nTo store and reuse [PaymentMethods](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods \"PaymentMethods\"), you must attach them to [Customer objects](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/save-and-reuse).\n\nAfter attaching the PaymentMethod to a Customer, store the [Customer ID](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-id) and [PaymentMethod ID](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods/object#payment_method_object-id) in your system to use it for payments in the future. Because one Customer object can have a [list of multiple payment methods](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods/list), you must specify both the Customer ID and the PaymentMethod ID when creating a charge later on.\n\nHere’s an example creating a Customer and attaching a PaymentMethod:\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/customers \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d name=\"Jenny Rosen\" \\   --data-urlencode email=\"jenny.rosen@stripe.com\" \\  -d payment_method={PAYMENT_METHOD_ID}`\n\n### Refunds![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nRefunds are managed using the [Refunds](https://docs.stripe.com/api/refunds) API and can be made for full or partial amounts. To refund a transaction with Stripe, you’ll need either the PaymentIntent ID or the Charge ID for the transaction you need to refund.\n\nRefunds use your _available_ Stripe balance, and can’t use your pending balance. If your available balance doesn’t have sufficient funds to cover the amount of the refund, Stripe debits the remaining amount from your bank account. You can issue partial refunds, full refunds, and more than one refund against a charge, but you can’t refund a total greater than the original charge amount.\n\nYou can issue refunds using the [API](https://docs.stripe.com/api) or the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/dashboard). You can’t cancel a refund after you issue it. It takes [5-10 business days](https://support.stripe.com/questions/customer-refund-processing-time) for the refund to appear on the customer’s statement. If a customer is curious about the status of their refund, you can [provide the ARN](https://support.stripe.com/questions/acquirer-reference-number-(arn)-for-refunds) so that they can inquire about the refund with their bank.\n\nHere’s an example refund for a PaymentIntent:\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/refunds \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d payment_intent={PAYMENT_INTENT_ID}`\n\nHere’s a partial refund example with an amount specified:\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/refunds \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d payment_intent={PAYMENT_INTENT_ID} \\   -d amount=1000`\n\n### Disputes and chargebacks![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYour business is responsible for managing [disputes (also known as chargebacks)](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes). We recommend that you actively monitor disputes and collect and submit evidence to support the validity of charges where appropriate. We hold disputed funds and deduct them from your Stripe balance pending a decision. We return the funds if you win the dispute.\n\nYou can monitor disputes in two ways:\n\n*   Use the Stripe Dashboard and email notifications that you can configure in your [Dashboard profile](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/user).\n*   You can fully automate the dispute response and evidence submission through the [Disputes](https://docs.stripe.com/api/disputes) API.\n\n[](#configuring-webhooks)\n\nYou can use [webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks \"webhook\") to capture events that occur on your account (such as payouts to your bank account, refunds, payments, and so on). They’re helpful when handling Stripe [events](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events) that occur asynchronously, or for those that you want to trigger additional actions for.\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/webhooks-endpoints.871d5a30be8e59762e191fa45b0421a2.png)\n\nSee our recommended webhook for each type:\n\n| **WEBHOOK TYPE** | **RECOMMENDED WEBHOOKS** |\n| --- | --- |\n| **CHARGES** | *   `charge.succeeded`<br>*   `charge.failed`<br>*   `charge.refunded` |\n| **REFUNDS** | *   `refund.created`<br>*   `refund.failed` |\n| **PAYOUTS** | *   `payout.created`<br>*   `payout.paid`<br>*   `payout.failed` |\n| **PAYMENT INTENTS** | *   `payment_intent.succeeded`<br>*   `payment_intent.payment_failed`<br>*   `payment_intent.canceled` |\n| **DISPUTES** | *   `radar.early_fraud_warning.created`<br>*   `charge.dispute.created`<br>*   `charge.dispute.closed` |\n\nUse the following resources to set up your webhooks and validate that they’ve been configured correctly:\n\n*   [Webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks)\n*   [Check the webhook signatures](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks#verify-events)\n*   [Types of events](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types)\n*   [Best practices for using webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks#best-practices)\n*   [Check your webhook configurations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/webhooks)",

In this integration, you’ll build a custom payment flow where you render the Payment Element, create the [SetupIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_intents \"Setup Intents API\"), and confirm the setup from the buyer’s browser.\n\n[](#set-up-stripe)\n\nFirst, [create a Stripe account](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register) or [sign in](https://dashboard.stripe.com/login).\n\nUse our official libraries to access the Stripe API from your application:\n\n`# Available as a gem sudo gem install stripe`\n\n`# If you use bundler, you can add this line to your Gemfile gem 'stripe'`\n\n[](#enable-payment-methods)\n\n#### Caution\n\nThis integration path doesn’t support BLIK or pre-authorized debits that use the Automated Clearing Settlement System (ACSS).\n\nView your [payment methods settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) and enable the payment methods you want to support. You need at least one payment method enabled to create a [SetupIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_intents \"Setup Intents API\").\n\nBy default, Stripe enables cards and other prevalent payment methods that can help you reach more customers, but we recommend turning on additional payment methods that are relevant for your business and customers. See [Payment method integration options](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/integration-options#payment-method-product-support) for product and payment method support, and our [pricing page](https://stripe.com/pricing/local-payment-methods) for fees.\n\n[](#web-collect-payment-details)\n\nYou’re ready to collect payment details on the client with the Payment Element. The Payment Element is a prebuilt UI component that simplifies collecting payment details for a variety of payment methods.\n\nThe Payment Element contains an iframe that securely sends payment information to Stripe over an HTTPS connection. Avoid placing the Payment Element within another iframe because some payment methods require redirecting to another page for payment confirmation.\n\nThe checkout page address must start with `https://` rather than `http://` for your integration to work. You can test your integration without using HTTPS, but remember to [enable it](https://docs.stripe.com/security/guide#tls) when you’re ready to accept live payments.\n\n### Set up Stripe.js![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe Payment Element is automatically available as a feature of Stripe.js. Include the Stripe.js script on your checkout page by adding it to the `head` of your HTML file. Always load Stripe.js directly from js.stripe.com to remain PCI compliant. Don’t include the script in a bundle or host a copy of it yourself.\n\nCreate an instance of Stripe with the following JavaScript on your checkout page:\n\n`// Set your publishable key: remember to change this to your live publishable key in production // See your keys here: [https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys) const stripe = Stripe(`\n\n`'pk_test_TYooMQauvdEDq54NiTphI7jx'`\n\n`);`\n\n### Add the Payment Element to your checkout page![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe Payment Element needs a place to live on your checkout page. Create an empty DOM node (container) with a unique ID in your payment form:\n\n`<form id=\"payment-form\">   <div id=\"payment-element\">     <!-- Elements will create form elements here -->   </div>   <button id=\"submit\">Submit</button>   <div id=\"error-message\">     <!-- Display error message to your customers here -->   </div> </form>`\n\nWhen the form above has loaded, create an Elements instance with the mode ‘setup’. Then, create an instance of the Payment Element and mount it to the container DOM node.\n\n`const options = {   mode: 'setup',   currency: 'usd',   // Fully customizable with appearance API.   appearance: {/*...*/}, };  // Set up Stripe.js and Elements to use in checkout form const elements = stripe.elements(options);  // Create and mount the Payment Element const paymentElement = elements.create('payment'); paymentElement.mount('#payment-element');`\n\nThe Payment Element renders a dynamic form that allows your customer to pick a payment method. The form automatically collects all necessary payments details for the payment method selected by the customer.\n\nYou can customize the Payment Element to match the design of your site by passing the [appearance object](https://docs.stripe.com/elements/appearance-api) into `options` when creating the `Elements` provider.\n\n### Collect addresses![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nBy default, the Payment Element only collects the necessary billing address details. To collect a customer’s full billing address (to calculate the tax for digital goods and services, for example) or shipping address, use the [Address Element](https://docs.stripe.com/elements/address-element).\n\n[](#create-customer)\n\nTo set up a payment method for future payments, you must attach it to a [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers \"Customers\"). Create a `Customer` object when your customer creates an account with your business. `Customer` objects allow for reusing payment methods and tracking across multiple payments.\n\n`curl -X POST https://api.stripe.com/v1/customers \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\"`\n\n[](#create-intent)\n\nWhen the customer submits your payment form, create a [SetupIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_intents \"Setup Intents API\") on your server. With `automatic_payment_methods` enabled, the SetupIntent is created using the payment methods you configured in the Dashboard.\n\nIncluded on a SetupIntent is a client secret. Return this value to your client for Stripe.js to use to securely complete the setup process.\n\n`require 'stripe' Stripe.api_key =` \n\n`'sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc'`\n\n``post '/create-intent' do   intent = Stripe::SetupIntent.create({     customer: customer.id,     # In the latest version of the API, specifying the `automatic_payment_methods` parameter is optional because Stripe enables its functionality by default.     automatic_payment_methods: {enabled: true},   })   {client_secret: intent.client_secret}.to_json end``\n\n[](#submit-the-setup)\n\nUse [stripe.confirmSetup](https://docs.stripe.com/js/setup_intents/confirm_setup) to complete the setup using details from the Payment Element.\n\nProvide a [return\\_url](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_intents/create#create_setup_intent-return_url) to this function to indicate where Stripe should redirect the user after they complete the setup. Your user might be initially redirected to an intermediate site, like a bank authorization page, before being redirected to the `return_url`. Card setups immediately redirect to the `return_url` when a setup is successful.\n\nIf you don’t want to redirect for card setups after setup completion, you can set [redirect](https://docs.stripe.com/js/setup_intents/confirm_setup#confirm_setup_intent-options-redirect) to `if_required`. This only redirects customers that check out with redirect-based payment methods.\n\n``const form = document.getElementById('payment-form'); const submitBtn = document.getElementById('submit');  const handleError = (error) => {   const messageContainer = document.querySelector('#error-message');   messageContainer.textContent = error.message;   submitBtn.disabled = false; }  form.addEventListener('submit', async (event) => {   // We don't want to let default form submission happen here,   // which would refresh the page.   event.preventDefault();    // Prevent multiple form submissions   if (submitBtn.disabled) {     return;   }    // Disable form submission while loading   submitBtn.disabled = true;    // Trigger form validation and wallet collection   const {error: submitError} = await elements.submit();   if (submitError) {     handleError(submitError);     return;   }    // Create the SetupIntent and obtain clientSecret   const res = await fetch(\"/create-intent\", {     method: \"POST\",   });    const {client_secret: clientSecret} = await res.json();    // Confirm the SetupIntent using the details collected by the Payment Element   const {error} = await stripe.confirmSetup({     elements,     clientSecret,     confirmParams: {       return_url: '[https://example.com/order/123/complete](https://example.com/order/123/complete)',     },   });    if (error) {     // This point is only reached if there's an immediate error when     // confirming the setup. Show the error to your customer (for example, payment details incomplete)     handleError(error);   } else {     // Your customer is redirected to your `return_url`. For some payment     // methods like iDEAL, your customer is redirected to an intermediate     // site first to authorize the payment, then redirected to the `return_url`.   } });``\n\n[](#charge-saved-payment-method)\n\n#### Warning\n\n`bancontact` and `ideal` are one-time payment methods by default. When set up for future usage, they generate a `sepa_debit` reusable payment method type so you need to use `sepa_debit` to query for saved payment methods.\n\n#### Compliance\n\nYou’re responsible for your compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, and network rules when saving a customer’s payment details. When rendering past payment methods to your end customer for future purchases, make sure you’re listing payment methods where you’ve collected consent from the customer to save the payment method details for this specific future use. To differentiate between payment methods attached to customers that can and can’t be presented to your end customer as a saved payment method for future purchases, use the [allow\\_redisplay](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods/object#payment_method_object-allow_redisplay) parameter.\n\nWhen you’re ready to charge your customer off-session, use the Customer and PaymentMethod IDs to create a PaymentIntent. To find a payment method to charge, list the payment methods associated with your customer. This example lists cards but you can list any supported [type](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods/object#payment_method_object-type).\n\n`curl -G https://api.stripe.com/v1/payment_methods \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d customer=  {{CUSTOMER_ID}}   \\  -d type=card`\n\nWhen you have the Customer and PaymentMethod IDs, create a PaymentIntent with the amount and currency of the payment. Set a few other parameters to make the off-session payment:\n\n*   Set [off\\_session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/confirm#confirm_payment_intent-off_session) to `true` to indicate that the customer isn’t in your checkout flow during a payment attempt and can’t fulfill an authentication request made by a partner, such as a card issuer, bank, or other payment institution. If, during your checkout flow, a partner requests authentication, Stripe requests exemptions using customer information from a previous on-session transaction. If the conditions for exemption aren’t met, the PaymentIntent might throw an error.\n*   Set the value of the PaymentIntent’s [confirm](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-confirm) property to `true`, which causes confirmation to occur immediately when the PaymentIntent is created.\n*   Set [payment\\_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api#create_payment_intent-payment_method) to the ID of the PaymentMethod and [customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api#create_payment_intent-customer) to the ID of the Customer.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/payment_intents \\   -u` \n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n``: \\   -d amount=1099 \\   -d currency=usd \\   # In the latest version of the API, specifying the `automatic_payment_methods` parameter is optional because Stripe enables its functionality by default.   -d \"automatic_payment_methods[enabled]\"=true \\   -d customer=\"{{CUSTOMER_ID}}\" \\   -d payment_method=\"{{PAYMENT_METHOD_ID}}\" \\   -d return_url=\"https://example.com/order/123/complete\" \\   -d off_session=true \\   -d confirm=true``\n\nWhen a payment attempt fails, the request also fails with a 402 HTTP status code and the status of the PaymentIntent is [requires\\_payment\\_method](https://docs.stripe.com/upgrades#2019-02-11 \"requires_payment_method\"). You must notify your customer to return to your application to complete the payment (for example, by sending an email or in-app notification).\n\nCheck the code of the [error](https://docs.stripe.com/api/errors/handling) raised by the Stripe API library. If the payment failed due to an [authentication\\_required](https://docs.stripe.com/declines/codes) decline code, use the declined PaymentIntent’s client secret with confirmPayment to allow the customer to authenticate the payment.\n\n``const form = document.getElementById('payment-form');  form.addEventListener('submit', async (event) => {   event.preventDefault();    const {error} = await stripe.confirmPayment({     // The client secret of the PaymentIntent     clientSecret,     confirmParams: {       return_url: '[https://example.com/order/123/complete](https://example.com/order/123/complete)',     },   });    if (error) {     // This point will only be reached if there is an immediate error when     // confirming the payment. Show error to your customer (for example, payment     // details incomplete)     const messageContainer = document.querySelector('#error-message');     messageContainer.textContent = error.message;   } else {     // Your customer will be redirected to your `return_url`. For some payment     // methods like iDEAL, your customer will be redirected to an intermediate     // site first to authorize the payment, then redirected to the `return_url`.   } });``\n\n#### Note\n\n`stripe.confirmPayment` can take several seconds to complete. During that time, disable your form from being resubmitted and show a waiting indicator like a spinner. If you receive an error, show it to the customer, re-enable the form, and hide the waiting indicator. If the customer must perform additional steps to complete the payment, such as authentication, Stripe.js walks them through that process.\n\nIf the payment failed for other reasons, such as insufficient funds, send your customer to a payment page to enter a new payment method. You can reuse the existing PaymentIntent to attempt the payment again with the new payment details.\n\n## See also![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n*   [Design an integration](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-element/design-an-integration)",

  "markdown": "# Connect to a reader | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\nTap to Pay on Android (TTPA) lets users accept in-person contactless payments with [compatible NFC-equipped Android devices](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/setup-reader/tap-to-pay?platform=android#supported-devices). TTPA requires the latest version of the [Terminal Android SDK](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/references/api). TTPA includes support for Visa, Mastercard, and American Express contactless cards and NFC-based mobile wallets (Apple Pay, Google Pay, and Samsung Pay). TTPA is an extension to the Terminal Android SDK and enables payments directly in your Android app.\n\nFollow these steps to connect your app to the Tap to Pay reader on a supported Android device:\n\n*   [Discover readers](#discover-readers) using the SDK to confirm device compatibility.\n*   [Connect to a reader](#connect-reader) using the SDK to accept payments.\n*   [Handle unexpected disconnects](#handling-disconnects) to make sure your user can continue to accept payments if the reader disconnects unexpectedly.\n\nIf your application runs on a device that doesn’t meet the [supported device criteria](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/setup-reader/tap-to-pay?platform=android#supported-devices), the SDK returns a `TerminalException` that provides additional context in an `onFailure` callback.\n\n[](#create-location)\n\nCreate a [Location](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/locations) for each physical location where your readers operate. Set the `display_name` to represent the name of the business. Your customer sees the `display_name` on the device’s tap screen unless you explicitly provide the name of a business when you connect to a reader. You can edit existing locations as necessary to adjust this text.\n\nIf your business requires you to move your readers frequently, your locations can use an address that represents your primary place of business.\n\nTo create a location using the API, use the [create location](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/locations/create) request.\n\nLocations for the US require:\n\n*   `line1`\n*   `city`\n*   `state`\n*   `postal_code`\n*   `country`\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/terminal/locations \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d display_name=\"Venice Burrito Shop\" \\  -d \"address[line1]\"=\"1272 Valencia Street\" \\  -d \"address[city]\"=\"San Francisco\" \\  -d \"address[state]\"=CA \\  -d \"address[country]\"=US \\  -d \"address[postal_code]\"=94110`\n\nTo create a location in the Dashboard, click the **+New** button on the [Locations](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/terminal/locations) page.\n\n[](#discover-readers)\n\nUse the `discoverReaders` method to determine hardware support for Tap to Pay on the Android device. `discoverReaders` verifies the following requirements:\n\n*   The device contains a functioning NFC antenna and chipset.\n*   The device has a hardware-backed keystore.\n*   The device runs a current version of Android (Android 11 or above).\n*   For the non-simulated version of the Tap to Pay reader, the application isn’t debuggable.\n\nYour application **must be** in the foreground for the Tap to Pay reader service to successfully start.\n\nIf your application runs on a device that doesn’t meet the requirements above, the `onFailure` callback returns with a `TerminalException` that contains a [TerminalErrorCode](https://stripe.dev/stripe-terminal-android/external/com.stripe.stripeterminal.external.models/-terminal-exception/-terminal-error-code/index.html) and additional context. The failures at this stage aren’t actionable by the end user.\n\nUsing the non-simulated, production version of the Tap to Pay reader with debuggable applications isn’t supported for security and compliance reasons. To test your integration with the Tap to Pay on Android reader, set `DiscoveryConfiguration.isSimulated` to _true_ during reader discovery. You must set this value to _false_ in the release version of your application.\n\n`var discoveryCancelable: Cancelable? = null  fun onDiscoverReaders() {   val isApplicationDebuggable = 0 != applicationInfo.flags and ApplicationInfo.FLAG_DEBUGGABLE   val config = DiscoveryConfiguration.LocalMobileDiscoveryConfiguration(     isSimulated = isApplicationDebuggable,   )   // Save this cancelable to an instance variable   discoveryCancelable = Terminal.getInstance().discoverReaders(     config,     object : DiscoveryListener {       override fun onUpdateDiscoveredReaders(readers: List<Reader>) {         // Automatically connect to supported mobile readers       }     },     object : Callback {       override fun onSuccess() {         println(\"Finished discovering readers\")       }        override fun onFailure(e: TerminalException) {         e.printStackTrace()       }     }   ) }  override fun onStop() {   super.onStop()    // If you're leaving the activity or fragment without selecting a reader,   // make sure you cancel the discovery process or the SDK will be stuck in   // a discover readers phase   discoveryCancelable?.cancel(object : Callback {     override fun onSuccess() { }     override fun onFailure(e: TerminalException) { }   }) }`\n\nTo check if a device meets the Tap to Pay hardware and OS requirements at runtime, use the [Terminal.supportsReadersOfType](https://stripe.dev/stripe-terminal-android/core/com.stripe.stripeterminal/-terminal/supports-readers-of-type.html) function. As part of initializing the Terminal SDK, this function requires your end user to accept permission requests to access the location and bluetooth. This function takes approximately 10ms to run on most devices.\n\n[](#connect-reader)\n\nTo accept Tap to Pay payments, provide the discovered reader from the previous step to the `connectLocalMobileReader` method.\n\n`connectLocalMobileReader` verifies the following requirements:\n\n*   The device has a stable connection to the internet.\n*   The device isn’t rooted and the device bootloader is locked and unchanged.\n*   The device uses Google Mobile Services.\n*   The device runs a current version of Android (Android 11 or above).\n*   The application uses a supported version of the Tap to Pay SDK (currently 2.20.0 or above).\n\nIf your application runs on a device that doesn’t meet the requirements above, the `onFailure` callback returns with a `TerminalException` that contains a [TerminalErrorCode](https://stripe.dev/stripe-terminal-android/external/com.stripe.stripeterminal.external.models/-terminal-exception/-terminal-error-code/index.html) and additional context. The end user can take action on some of the [failure reasons](https://stripe.dev/stripe-terminal-android/external/com.stripe.stripeterminal.external.models/-terminal-exception/-terminal-error-code/index.html). For example:\n\n*   `STRIPE_API_CONNECTION_ERROR`: The user can connect to a stable internet source.\n*   `LOCAL_MOBILE_UNSUPPORTED_ANDROID_VERSION`: The user can upgrade their operating system, if an update is available from the device manufacturer.\n\n`// after selecting a reader to connect to val config = LocalMobileConnectionConfiguration(`\n\n`\"{{LOCATION_ID}}\"`\n\n`) Terminal.getInstance().connectLocalMobileReader(firstReader, config, object : ReaderCallback {     override fun onSuccess(reader: Reader) {         System.out.println(\"Connected to mobile device\")     }      override fun onFailure(e: TerminalException) {         e.printStackTrace()     } })`\n\n## Handle unexpected disconnects ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nUnexpected disconnects might occur between your app and the reader. For example, the Tap to Pay reader might unexpectedly disconnect because:\n\n*   Android OS terminates the Tap to Pay reader service due to memory constraints.\n*   The device loses internet connectivity.\n\nThere are two ways you can choose to handle this:\n\n#### 1\\. Handle the disconnect manually![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nTo handle the disconnect, you must implement the `TerminalListener.onUnexpectedReaderDisconnect` callback. This allows your app to reconnect to the Tap to Pay reader and, when appropriate, notify the user of what went wrong and how they can enable access to Tap to Pay. End users can resolve [certain errors](#connect-reader), such as internet connectivity issues.\n\n`class ReaderActivity : AppCompatActivity(), TerminalListener {    // ...    Terminal.getInstance().setTerminalListener(this)    // TerminalListener   override fun onUnexpectedReaderDisconnect(reader: Reader) {     // Consider displaying a UI to notify the user and start rediscovering readers   } }`\n\n#### 2\\. Automatically attempt reconnection![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nSet `autoReconnectOnUnexpectedDisconnect` as `true` on the `LocalMobileConnectionConfiguration` and a `ReaderReconnectionListener` listener for reconnection events in your app.\n\n`val localMobileReaderReconnectionListener = yourReconnectionListener  Terminal.getInstance().connectLocalMobileReader(     reader,     LocalMobileConnectionConfiguration(       connectLocationId,       autoReconnectOnUnexpectedDisconnect = true,       localMobileReaderReconnectionListener     ),     readerListener,     readerCallback, )`\n\nIf you automatically attempt reconnection, the following occurs:\n\n1.  When a disconnect occurs, the SDK automatically attempts to reconnect and notifies you through `onReaderReconnectStarted`. Make sure your app announces that the connection was lost and a reconnection is in progress.\n    *   You can use the `Cancelable` object to stop the reconnection attempt at any time.\n2.  If the SDK successfully reconnects to the reader, Stripe notifies you through `onReaderReconnectSucceeded`. Make sure your app announces that the connection was restored and to continue normal operations.\n3.  If the SDK can’t reconnect to the reader, Stripe notifies you through `onReaderReconnectFailed`. Make sure your app announces that an unexpected disconnect occurred.\n\n`val localMobileReaderReconnectionListener = object : ReaderReconnectionListener {     override fun onReaderReconnectStarted(reader: Reader, cancelReconnect: Cancelable) {         // 1. Notified at the start of a reconnection attempt         // Use cancelable to stop reconnection at any time     }      override fun onReaderReconnectSucceeded(reader: Reader) {         // 2. Notified when reader reconnection succeeds         // App is now connected     }      override fun onReaderReconnectFailed(reader: Reader) {         // 3. Notified when reader reconnection fails         // App is now disconnected     } }`\n\nThe BBPOS and Chipper™ name and logo are trademarks or registered trademarks of BBPOS Limited in the United States and/or other countries.

We recommend that you integrate with the [latest version](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-terminal-android/releases).\n\n`dependencies {    implementation(\"com.stripe:stripeterminal-core:3.7.1\")    implementation(\"com.stripe:stripeterminal-handoffclient:3.7.1\") }`\n\nMake sure that you aren’t using any other Stripe Terminal SDK dependencies. For example, if you previously integrated the Terminal Android SDK, don’t use the top-level `com.stripe:stripeterminal` dependency (for example, `com.stripe:stripeterminal:3.7.1`).\n\nSee an example of [including dependencies in your app’s build script](https://github.com/stripe-samples/terminal-apps-on-devices/blob/718c2de38c7b8003fcf58c536c266bb990ad43a7/app/build.gradle.kts#L66).\n\n### Configure your application![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nTo inform the Stripe SDK of lifecycle events, add a [TerminalApplicationDelegate.onCreate()](https://stripe.dev/stripe-terminal-android/core/com.stripe.stripeterminal/-terminal-application-delegate/on-create.html) call to the [onCreate()](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Application#onCreate()) method for your application subclass.\n\n`class MyApp : Application() {    override fun onCreate() {        super.onCreate()         TerminalApplicationDelegate.onCreate(this)    } }`\n\nIn your [app manifest](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/manifest-intro), specify the name of your `Application` subclass with the `android:name` attribute.\n\nLearn more about [setting up your integration](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/setup-integration?terminal-sdk-platform=android) or see the Apps on Devices sample app GitHub repository for an example of [configuring the Application subclass](https://github.com/stripe-samples/terminal-apps-on-devices/blob/718c2de38c7b8003fcf58c536c266bb990ad43a7/app/src/main/java/com/stripe/aod/sampleapp/MyApp.kt#L10).\n\n[](#build-app)\n\nFollow the guidance below for Apps on Devices integrations.\n\n### Discover and connect a reader![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYou must register a new Stripe device to your account as a new [Reader object](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/object). Use the pairing code provided in the device’s admin settings to [create the Reader object](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/create). Your app uses the Stripe Terminal Android SDK to discover and connect to your device:\n\n1.  Your app runs on your registered device.\n2.  Your app discovers the reader by calling [discoverReaders](https://stripe.dev/stripe-terminal-android/core/com.stripe.stripeterminal/-terminal/discover-readers.html) with [DiscoveryConfiguration.HandoffDiscoveryConfiguration](https://stripe.dev/stripe-terminal-android/external/com.stripe.stripeterminal.external.models/-discovery-configuration/-handoff-discovery-configuration/index.html).\n3.  Your app connects to the reader by using [connectHandoffReader](https://stripe.dev/stripe-terminal-android/core/com.stripe.stripeterminal/-terminal/connect-handoff-reader.html).\n\nThe following example shows how to discover and connect to a Stripe reader using handoff mode in an Android app:\n\n`private fun discoverReaders() {    Terminal.getInstance().discoverReaders(        config = DiscoveryConfiguration.HandoffDiscoveryConfiguration(),        discoveryListener = object : DiscoveryListener {            override fun onUpdateDiscoveredReaders(readers: List<Reader>) {                // In handoff discovery, the list will                // contain a single reader. Connect to                // the reader after it is discovered.                readers.firstOrNull()?.let { reader ->                    connectReader(reader)                }            }        },        callback = object : Callback {            override fun onSuccess() {                // success            }             override fun onFailure(e: TerminalException) {                // failure            }        }    ) }  private fun connectReader(reader: Reader) {    Terminal.getInstance().connectHandoffReader(        reader = reader,        config = ConnectionConfiguration.HandoffConnectionConfiguration(),        listener = null,        connectionCallback = object: ReaderCallback {            override fun onSuccess(reader: Reader) {                // ready for payment collection            }             override fun onFailure(e: TerminalException) {            }        }    ) }`\n\n### Collect payments![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nAfter you connect to the reader using handoff mode, you can start [collecting payments](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/collect-card-payment?terminal-sdk-platform=android#create-payment).\n\nThe Stripe Reader app handles payment collection and other payment operations, such as [saving a card](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/features/saving-cards/overview). When initiating a payment operation, the Stripe Reader app becomes the primary and launches in full screen. Then, the Stripe Reader app guides the customer through the flow and returns control to your app after completion (success or failure) or customer cancellation. When control returns to your app, the Stripe Reader app continues to run in the background.\n\nSee an example of [collecting payment in an Apps on Devices app](https://github.com/stripe-samples/terminal-apps-on-devices/blob/718c2de38c7b8003fcf58c536c266bb990ad43a7/app/src/main/java/com/stripe/aod/sampleapp/model/CheckoutViewModel.kt#L82).\n\n#### Collect payments while offline Beta![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nApps on Devices supports [offline payment collection](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/features/operate-offline/collect-card-payments?terminal-sdk-platform=android&reader-type=internet).\n\n[](#device-management)\n\nYou can access the device’s admin settings by launching the `stripe://settings/` deep-link URI from your app.\n\nSee an example of [launching the admin settings deep-link URI](https://github.com/stripe-samples/terminal-apps-on-devices/blob/718c2de38c7b8003fcf58c536c266bb990ad43a7/app/src/main/java/com/stripe/aod/sampleapp/fragment/HomeFragment.kt#L30).\n\n`startActivity(     Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW)         .setData(Uri.parse(\"stripe://settings/\")) )`\n\n[](#instrument-app)\n\nStripe doesn’t provide an application-level instrumentation solution. To keep track of crashes and other logs from your application, you can use a third-party library such as Sentry or Crashlytics.\n\n[](#device-locale)\n\nThe device user’s language selection (not country) informs the value returned by [Locale.getDefault()](https://developer.android.com/reference/java/util/Locale#getDefault()). You can change the device language in the admin settings.\n\n[](#device-accessories)\n\nWhen the Stripe reader connects or disconnects from a dock, the Android operation system triggers a [configuration change](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/runtime-changes).\n\nBy default, your app’s activity is automatically recreated on a configuration change.\n\nTo disable automatic activity recreation when connecting to or disconnecting from a dock, add `android:configChanges=\"uiMode\"` in the `<activity>` entry in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file.\n\n`<activity     android:name=\".MyActivity\"     android:configChanges=\"uiMode\" />`\n\nYour activity can be notified of configuration changes by implementing [Activity::onConfigurationChanged](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity#onConfigurationChanged(android.content.res.Configuration)). This method is only called if you’ve specified configurations you want to handle with the `android:configChanges` attribute in your manifest.\n\n`class MainActivity : Activity() {     override fun onConfigurationChanged(newConfig: Configuration) {         super.onConfigurationChanged(newConfig)         // implement custom configuration change handling logic     } }`\n\n## Test your app ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nUse your S700 DevKit device to test your app in the Stripe Dashboard or using the Android Debug Bridge (`adb`).\n\nYou can connect your DevKit device to your computer using a USB-A to USB-C cable. Then, use `adb` to directly install your app’s assembled APK onto the DevKit device.\n\nThe following examples assume your application’s [package name](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/configure-app-module) is `com.example.myapp` and the [main activity](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent.html#ACTION_MAIN) is `MainActivity`.\n\nAfter installation completes, launch your app:\n\n`$ adb shell am start com.example.myapp/.MainActivity`\n\nStart admin settings:\n\n`$ adb shell am start -d \"stripe://settings/\"`\n\nIf needed, uninstall your app:\n\n`$ adb uninstall com.example.myapp`\n\nGoogle’s [Android Debug Bridge documentation](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb) provides a comprehensive guide to using `adb`.\n\n## Test payments![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nDevKit devices can process test payments using a Stripe physical test card, which you can order in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/terminal/shop/thsku_FmpZaTqwezTFvS). When [testing payments](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/references/testing#physical-test-cards), you can use decimal amounts to produce specific outcomes.\n\n#### Warning\n\nDon’t use real cards for test payments on DevKit devices.",

Do not save AccountSessions to your database as they expire relatively quickly, and cannot be used more than once.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect embedded components](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-connect-embedded-components)\n\n## [Application Fees](https://docs.stripe.com/api/application_fees)\n\nWhen you collect a transaction fee on top of a charge made for your user (using [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)), an `Application Fee` object is created in your account. You can list, retrieve, and refund application fees.\n\nRelated guide: [Collecting application fees](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges#collect-fees)\n\n## [Country Specs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/country_specs)\n\nStripe needs to collect certain pieces of information about each account created. These requirements can differ depending on the account’s country. The Country Specs API makes these rules available to your integration.\n\nYou can also view the information from this API call as [an online guide](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information).\n\n## [Person](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/create)[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/update)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/retrieve)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/list)[DELETE/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/delete)\n\n## [Transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/transfers)\n\nA `Transfer` object is created when you move funds between Stripe accounts as part of Connect.\n\nBefore April 6, 2017, transfers also represented movement of funds from a Stripe account to a card or bank account. This behavior has since been split out into a [Payout](#payout_object) object, with corresponding payout endpoints. For more information, read about the [transfer/payout split](https://docs.stripe.com/transfer-payout-split).\n\nRelated guide: [Creating separate charges and transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n\n## [Secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/secret_management)\n\nSecret Store is an API that allows Stripe Apps developers to securely persist secrets for use by UI Extensions and app backends.\n\nThe primary resource in Secret Store is a `secret`. Other apps can’t view secrets created by an app. Additionally, secrets are scoped to provide further permission control.\n\nAll Dashboard users and the app backend share `account` scoped secrets. Use the `account` scope for secrets that don’t change per-user, like a third-party API key.\n\nA `user` scoped secret is accessible by the app backend and one specific Dashboard user. Use the `user` scope for per-user secrets like per-user OAuth tokens, where different users might have different permissions.\n\nRelated guide: [Store data between page reloads](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/store-auth-data-custom-objects)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[GET/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/list)[POST/v1/apps/secrets/delete](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/delete)[GET/v1/apps/secrets/find](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/find)[POST/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/set)\n\n## [Reviews](https://docs.stripe.com/api/radar/reviews)\n\nReviews can be used to supplement automated fraud detection with human expertise.\n\nLearn more about [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar) and reviewing payments [here](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/reviews).\n\n## [Authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/update)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/list)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/approve](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/approve)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/decline](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/decline)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_create)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/capture](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_capture)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/expire](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_expire)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/finalize\\_amount](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_finalize_amount)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/increment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_increment)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/fraud\\_challenges/respond](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/respond_to_fraud_challenges)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/reverse](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_reverse)\n\n## [Cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/create)[POST/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/update)[GET/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/list)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/deliver](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_deliver)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/fail](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_fail)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/return](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_return)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/ship](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_ship)\n\n## [Physical Bundles](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/physical_bundles)\n\nA Physical Bundle represents the bundle of physical items -

For example, WisePOS E is a TerminalHardwareProduct and a WisePOS E - US and WisePOS E - UK are TerminalHardwareSKUs.\n\n## [Terminal Hardware SKU](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_skus)Preview feature\n\nA TerminalHardwareSKU represents a SKU for Terminal hardware. A SKU is a representation of a product available for purchase, containing information such as the name, price, and images.\n\n## [Transaction Entries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/transaction_entries)\n\nTransactionEntries represent individual units of money movements within a single [Transaction](#transactions).\n\n## [Scheduled Queries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/sigma/scheduled_queries)\n\nIf you have [scheduled a Sigma query](https://docs.stripe.com/sigma/scheduled-queries), you’ll receive a `sigma.scheduled_query_run.created` webhook each time the query runs. The webhook contains a `ScheduledQueryRun` object, which you can use to retrieve the query results.\n\n## [Report Types](https://docs.stripe.com/api/reporting/report_type)\n\nThe Report Type resource corresponds to a particular type of report, such as the “Activity summary” or “Itemized payouts” reports. These objects are identified by an ID belonging to a set of enumerated values. See [API Access to Reports documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/reporting/statements/api) for those Report Type IDs, along with required and optional parameters.\n\nNote that certain report types can only be run based on your live-mode data (not test-mode data), and will error when queried without a [live-mode API key](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#test-live-modes).\n\n## [Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/financial_connections/sessions)\n\nA Financial Connections Session is the secure way to programmatically launch the client-side Stripe.js modal that lets your users link their accounts.\n\n## [Verification Report](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_reports)\n\nA VerificationReport is the result of an attempt to collect and verify data from a user. The collection of verification checks performed is determined from the `type` and `options` parameters used. You can find the result of each verification check performed in the appropriate sub-resource: `document`, `id_number`, `selfie`.\n\nEach VerificationReport contains a copy of any data collected by the user as well as reference IDs which can be used to access collected images through the [FileUpload](https://docs.stripe.com/api/files) API. To configure and create VerificationReports, use the [VerificationSession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_sessions) API.\n\nRelated guide: [Accessing verification results](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verification-sessions#results).\n\n## [Crypto Onramp Quotes](https://docs.stripe.com/api/crypto/onramp_quotes)\n\nCrypto Onramp Quotes are estimated quotes for onramp conversions into all the different cryptocurrencies on different networks. The Quotes API allows you to display quotes in your product UI before directing the user to the onramp widget.\n\nRelated guide: [Quotes API](https://docs.stripe.com/crypto/quotes-api)\n\n## [Climate Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/climate/product)\n\nA Climate product represents a type of carbon removal unit available for reservation. You can retrieve it to see the current price and availability.\n\n## [Forwarding Request](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/request)\n\nInstructs Stripe to make a request on your behalf using the destination URL. The destination URL is activated by Stripe at the time of onboarding. Stripe verifies requests with your credentials provided during onboarding, and injects card details from the payment\\_method into the request.\n\nStripe redacts all sensitive fields and headers, including authentication credentials and card numbers, before storing the request and response data in the forwarding Request object, which are subject to a 30-day retention period.\n\nYou can provide a Stripe idempotency key to make sure that requests with the same key result in only one outbound request. The Stripe idempotency key provided should be unique and different from any idempotency keys provided on the underlying third-party request.\n\nForwarding Requests are synchronous requests that return a response or time out according to Stripe’s limits.\n\nRelated guide: [Forward card details to third-party API endpoints](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/forwarding).\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/create)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/retrieve)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/list)",

You can integrate either API into Stripe’s prebuilt payment platforms. Depending on your checkout flow and the level of control you require, these APIs support different use cases:\n\n*   The [Checkout Sessions API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions) allows you to model your customer’s checkout process. This includes the line items in their purchase, billing or shipping addresses, applicable tax rates, and coupons or discounts. The CheckoutSession manages creating subscriptions, calculating tax rates with Stripe Tax, or initiating payments.\n*   The [Payment Intents API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents) is a lower-level API that only focuses on modeling the payments step. Unlike the Checkout Sessions API, which requires line item details, you only pass in the final amount you want to charge. To use Stripe to calculate applicable taxes or create subscriptions, you need to integrate with the Stripe [Tax API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax/calculations) or [Subscriptions API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions).\n\n![Checkout Sessions versus Payment Intents API](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/checkout-sessions-vs-payment-intents.9395694871e31814befdc186bb6ab4d4.png)\n\nComparing the Checkout Sessions and Payment Intents APIs\n\nBecause the Checkout Sessions API uses [line\\_items](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/object#checkout_session_object-line_items), it integrates natively with other Stripe products such as Stripe Tax, Stripe Billing, and Automatic Currency Conversion. However, you can also integrate with these other products using the Payment Intents API in combination with other standalone Stripe APIs.",

  "markdown": "# Build a custom checkout page that includes Link\n\n## Integrate Link using the Payment Element or Link Authentication Element.\n\nThis guide walks you through how to accept payments with [Link](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link/what-is-link) using the [Payment Intents API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents) and either the [Payment Element](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-element) or [Link Authentication Element](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/elements/link-authentication-element).\n\nThere are three ways you can secure a customer email address for Link authentication and enrollment:\n\n*   **Pass in an email address:** You can pass an email address to the Payment Element using [defaultValues](https://docs.stripe.com/js/elements_object/create_payment_element#payment_element_create-options-defaultValues). If you’re already collecting the email address and or customer’s phone number in the checkout flow, we recommend this approach.\n*   **Collect an email address:** You can collect an email address directly in the Payment Element. If you’re not collecting the email address anywhere in the checkout flow, we recommend this approach.\n*   **Link Authentication Element:** You can use the Link Authentication Element to create a single email input field for both email collection and Link authentication. We recommend doing this if you use the [Address Element](https://docs.stripe.com/elements/address-element).\n\n![Authenticate or enroll with Link directly in the Payment Element during checkout](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/link-in-pe.2efb5138a4708b781b8a913ebddd9aba.png)\n\nCollect a customer email address for Link authentication or enrollment\n\n[](#set-up-stripe)\n\nFirst, [create a Stripe account](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register) or [sign in](https://dashboard.stripe.com/login).\n\nUse our official libraries to access the Stripe API from your application:\n\n`# Available as a gem sudo gem install stripe`\n\n`# If you use bundler, you can add this line to your Gemfile gem 'stripe'`\n\n[](#web-create-intent)\n\nStripe uses a [PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents) object to represent your intent to collect payment from a customer, tracking charge attempts and payment state changes throughout the process.\n\n![An overview diagram of the entire payment flow](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/accept-a-payment-payment-element.5cf6795a02f864923f9953611493d735.svg)\n\nYou can accept payments with Link using information your customer stores in the Link app. Because you don’t use the Link `payment_method.type`, when you receive a payment from a customer using Link in the Payment Element, the `payment_method.type` listed for the payment is `card`.\n\nTo use the Link `payment_method.type`, update your integration to set `payment_method_types` to `link`. Alternatively, you can set `automatic_payment_methods` to `enabled` and let Stripe dynamically display the most relevant payment methods to your customers.\n\nCreate a PaymentIntent on your server with an amount and currency, and `payment_method_types` set to `link` and any other payment methods you want to accept. Always decide how much to charge on the server side (a trusted environment) instead of the client. This prevents malicious customers from choosing their own prices.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/payment_intents \\   -u` \n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`: \\   -d \"amount\"=1099 \\   -d \"currency\"=\"usd\" \\   -d \"automatic_payment_methods[enabled]\"=true`\n\n### Retrieve the client secret![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe PaymentIntent includes a [client secret](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-client_secret \"PaymentIntent client secret\") that the client side uses to securely complete the payment process. You can use different approaches to pass the client secret to the client side.\n\nRetrieve the client secret from an endpoint on your server, using the browser’s `fetch` function. This approach is best if your client side is a single-page application, particularly one built with a modern frontend framework like React. Create the server endpoint that serves the client secret:\n\n`get '/secret' do   intent = # ... Create or retrieve the PaymentIntent   {client_secret: intent.client_secret}.to_json end`\n\nAnd then fetch the client secret with JavaScript on the client side:\n\n`(async () => {   const response = await fetch('/secret');   const {client_secret: clientSecret} = await response.json();   // Render the form using the clientSecret })();`\n\n[](#design-your-integration)\n\nLink authenticates a customer by using their email address. Depending on your checkout flow, you have the following options: pass an email to the Payment Element, collect it directly within the Payment Element, or use the Link Authentication Element. Of these, Stripe recommends passing a customer email address to the Payment Element if available.\n\nIf _any_ of the following apply to you:\n\n*   You want a single, optimized component for email collection and Link authentication.\n*   You need to collect a shipping address from your customer.\n\nThen use the integration flow that implements these elements: the Link Authentication Element, Payment Element and optional Address Element.\n\nA Link-enabled checkout page has the Link Authentication Element at the beginning, followed by the Address Element, and the Payment Element at the end. You can also display the Link Authentication Element on separate pages, in this same order, for multi-page checkout flows.\n\n![Create a payment form using multiple Elements](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/link-with-elements.f60af275f69b6e6e73c766d1f9928457.png)\n\nCreate a payment form using multiple Elements\n\nThe integration works as follows:\n\n[](#web-collect-payment-details)\n\nNow you can set up your custom payment form with the Elements prebuilt UI components. Your payment page address must start with `https://` rather than `http://` for your integration to work. You can test your integration without using HTTPS. [Enable HTTPS](https://docs.stripe.com/security/guide#tls) when you’re ready to accept live payments.\n\nThe Link Authentication Element renders an email address input. When Link matches a customer email with an existing Link account, it sends the customer a secure, one-time code to their phone to authenticate. If the customer successfully authenticates, Stripe displays their Link-saved addresses and payment methods automatically for them to use.\n\nThis integration also creates the Payment Element, which renders a dynamic form that allows your customer to pick a payment method type. The form automatically collects all necessary payments details for the payment method type selected by the customer. The Payment Element also handles the display of Link-saved payment methods for authenticated customers.\n\n### Set up Stripe Elements ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nInstall React Stripe.js and the Stripe.js loader from the [npm public registry](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@stripe/react-stripe-js).\n\n`npm install --save @stripe/react-stripe-js @stripe/stripe-js`\n\nOn your payment page, wrap your payment form with the `Elements` component, passing the [client secret](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-client_secret) from [the previous step](#web-create-intent). ​​If you already collect the customer’s email in another part of your form, replace your existing input with the `linkAuthenticationElement​`.\n\nIf you don’t collect email, add the `linkAuthenticationElement​` to your checkout flow. You must place the `linkAuthenticationElement` before the `ShippingAddressElement` (optional if you collect shipping addresses) and the `PaymentElement` for Link to autofill Link-saved details for your customer in the `ShippingAddressElement` and `PaymentElement`. You can also pass in the [appearance option](https://docs.stripe.com/elements/appearance-api), customizing the Elements to match the design of your site.\n\nIf you have the customer’s email, pass it to the `defaultValues` option of the `linkAuthenticationElement`. This prefills their email address and initiates the Link authentication process.\n\nIf you have other customer information, pass it to the `defaultValues.billingDetails` object for the `PaymentElement`. Prefilling as much information as possible simplifies Link account creation and reuse for your customers.\n\nThen, render the `linkAuthenticationElement` and `PaymentElement` components in your payment form:\n\n`import {loadStripe} from \"@stripe/stripe-js\"; import {   Elements,   LinkAuthenticationElement,   PaymentElement, } from \"@stripe/react-stripe-js\";  const stripe = loadStripe(`\n\n`'pk_test_TYooMQauvdEDq54NiTphI7jx'`\n\n`);  // Customize the appearance of Elements using the Appearance API. const appearance = {/* ... */};  // Enable the skeleton loader UI for the optimal loading experience. const loader = 'auto';`\n\nThe `linkAuthenticationElement`, `PaymentElement`, and `ShippingAddressElement` don’t need to be on the same page. If you have a process where customer contact information, shipping details, and payment details display to the customer in separate steps, you can display each Element in the appropriate step or page. Include the `linkAuthenticationElement` as the email input form in the contact info collection step to make sure the customer can take full advantage of the shipping and payment autofill provided by Link.\n\nIf you collect your customer’s email with the Link Authentication Element early in the checkout flow, you don’t need to show it again on the shipping or payment pages.\n\n### Retrieve an email address ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nYou can retrieve the email address details using the `onChange` prop on the `linkAuthenticationElement` component. The `onChange` handler fires whenever the user updates the email field, or when a saved customer email is autofilled.\n\n`<linkAuthenticationElement onChange={(event) => {   setEmail(event.value.email); }} />`\n\n### Prefill a customer email address ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nThe Link Authentication Element accepts an email address. Providing a customer’s email address triggers the Link authentication flow as soon as the customer lands on the payment page using the `defaultValues` option.\n\n`<linkAuthenticationElement options={{defaultValues: {email: 'foo@bar.com'}}}/>`\n\n[](#web-submit-payment)\n\nUse [stripe.confirmPayment](https://docs.stripe.com/js/payment_intents/confirm_payment) to complete the payment with details collected from your customer in the different Elements forms. Provide a [return\\_url](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-return_url) to this function to indicate where Stripe redirects the user after they complete the payment.\n\nYour user might be first redirected to an intermediate site, like a bank authorization page, before Stripe redirects them to the `return_url`.\n\nBy default, card and bank payments immediately redirect to the `return_url` when a payment is successful. If you don’t want to redirect to the `return_url`, you can use [`if_required`](https://docs.stripe.com/js/payment_intents/confirm_payment#confirm_payment_intent-options-redirect) to change the behavior.\n\n`import {loadStripe} from \"@stripe/stripe-js\"; import {   useStripe,   useElements,   Elements,   LinkAuthenticationElement,   PaymentElement,   // If collecting shipping   AddressElement, } from \"@stripe/react-stripe-js\";  const stripe = loadStripe(`\n\n`'pk_test_TYooMQauvdEDq54NiTphI7jx'`\n\n`);  const appearance = {/* ... */};  // Enable the skeleton loader UI for the optimal loading experience. const loader = 'auto';  const CheckoutPage =({clientSecret}) => (   <Elements stripe={stripe} options={{clientSecret, appearance, loader}}>     <CheckoutForm />   </Elements> );  export default function CheckoutForm() {   const stripe = useStripe();   const elements = useElements();    const handleSubmit = async (event) => {     event.preventDefault();      const {error} = await stripe.confirmPayment({       elements,       confirmParams: {         return_url: \"[https://example.com/order/123/complete](https://example.com/order/123/complete)\",       },     });      if (error) {       // handle error     }   };    return (     <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>       <h3>Contact info</h3>       <LinkAuthenticationElement />       {/* If collecting shipping */}       <h3>Shipping</h3>       <AddressElement options={{mode: 'shipping', allowedCountries: ['US']}} />       <h3>Payment</h3>       <PaymentElement />        <button type=\"submit\">Submit</button>     </form>   ); }`\n\nThe `return_url` corresponds to a page on your website that provides [the payment status](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents/verifying-status) of the `PaymentIntent` when you render the return page. When Stripe redirects the customer to the `return_url`, you can use the following URL query parameters to verify payment status. You can also append your own query parameters when providing the `return_url`. These query parameters persist through the redirect process.\n\n| Parameter | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `payment_intent` | The unique identifier for the `PaymentIntent` |\n| `payment_intent_client_secret` | The [client secret](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-client_secret) of the `PaymentIntent` object. |\n\n[](#web-post-payment)\n\nStripe sends a [payment\\_intent.succeeded](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-payment_intent.succeeded) event when the payment completes. [Use a webhook to receive these events](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks/quickstart) and run actions, like sending an order confirmation email to your customer, logging the sale in a database, or starting a shipping workflow.\n\nConfigure your integration to listen for these events rather than waiting on a callback from the client. When you wait on a callback from the client, the customer can close the browser window or quit the app before the callback executes. Setting up your integration to listen for asynchronous events enables you to accept [different types of payment methods](https://stripe.com/payments/payment-methods-guide) with a single integration.\n\nIn addition to handling the `payment_intent.succeeded` event, you can also handle two other important events when collecting payments with the Payment Element:\n\n| Event | Description | Action |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| [payment\\_intent.succeeded](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types?lang=php#event_types-payment_intent.succeeded) | Sent from Stripe when a customer has successfully completed a payment. | Send the customer an order confirmation and fulfill their order. |\n| [payment\\_intent.payment\\_failed](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types?lang=php#event_types-payment_intent.payment_failed) | Sent from Stripe when a customer attempted a payment, but the payment didn’t succeed. | If a payment transitioned from `processing` to `payment_failed`, offer the customer another attempt to pay. |\n\n[](#web-test-the-integration)\n\n#### Caution\n\nDon’t store real user data in [test mode](https://docs.stripe.com/test-mode \"test mode\") Link accounts. Treat them as if they’re publicly available, because these test accounts are associated with your publishable key.\n\nCurrently, Link only works with credit cards, debit cards, and qualified US bank account purchases. Link requires [domain registration](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/pmd-registration).\n\nYou can create test mode accounts for Link using any valid email address. The following table shows the fixed one-time passcode values that Stripe accepts for authenticating test mode accounts:\n\n| Value | Outcome |\n| --- | --- |\n| Any other 6 digits not listed below | Success |\n| 000001 | Error, code invalid |\n| 000002 | Error, code expired |\n| 000003 | Error, max attempts exceeded |\n\nFor testing specific payment methods, refer to the [Payment Element testing examples](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=web#additional-testing-resources).\n\n### Multiple funding sources![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nAs Stripe adds additional funding source support, you don’t need to update your integration. Stripe automatically supports them with the same transaction settlement time and guarantees as card and bank account payments.\n\n### Card authentication and 3D Secure![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nLink supports [3D Secure 2 (3DS2)](https://stripe.com/guides/3d-secure-2 \"3D Secure 2 (3DS2)\") authentication for card payments. 3DS2 requires customers to complete an additional verification step with the card issuer when paying. Payments that have been successfully authenticated using 3D Secure are covered by a liability shift.\n\nTo trigger 3DS2 authentication challenge flows with Link in test mode, use the following test card with any CVC, postal code, and future expiration date: .\n\nIn test mode, the authentication process displays a mock authentication page. On that page, you can either authorize or cancel the payment. Authorizing the payment simulates successful authentication and redirects you to the specified return URL. Clicking the **Failure** button simulates an unsuccessful attempt at authentication.\n\nFor more details, refer to the [3D Secure authentication page](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure).\n\n#### Note\n\nWhen testing 3DS flows, only test cards for 3DS2 will trigger authentication on Link.\n\n[](#disclose-cookies)\n\nStripe collects information on customer interactions with Elements to provide services to you, prevent fraud, and improve its services.

You can customize the on-reader checkout UI using a suite of pre-built and custom elements.\n\nThe [Stripe Terminal SDK connects to the reader](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/connect-reader?reader-type=internet) over the internet, LAN, or [handoff mode](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/features/apps-on-devices/build#discover-and-connect-a-reader). This reader is compatible with the following integrations:\n\n*   JavaScript SDK\n*   iOS SDK\n*   Android SDK\n*   React Native SDK\n*   Server-driven\n\nFor Stripe Reader S700, we recommend the [server-driven integration](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/setup-integration?terminal-sdk-platform=server-driven), which uses the Stripe API instead of a Terminal SDK. To view the reader’s parts and features, see the [Stripe Reader S700 product sheet](https://d37ugbyn3rpeym.cloudfront.net/docs/terminal/S700_Product_Sheet_legal_0240314.pdf).\n\n## Turn the reader on and off![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nConnect the reader to power by plugging the provided USB-C cable into the port on the left side of your reader. Connect the opposite end of the USB-C cable to the provided power adapter and plug it into a power outlet. The Stripe Reader S700 requires a recommended 12W of power to operate properly. Stripe power adapters and cables are recommended for the charging and operation of the S700 and its accessories. Using alternative power adapters or cables might result in failure modes including inadequate S700 charging, and might invalidate your product warranty.\n\n![Side of Stripe Reader S700](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/s700-side-view.66affe17a0aeac5999a561f44d67bfbc.png)\n\nStripe Reader S700\n\nAfter the reader is fully charged, hold down the power button on the right side until the screen turns on. After the device powers on, press the power button to sleep or wake the device. To fully power off the device, hold down the power button until the power off option appears on the screen, then select it.\n\nIn a countertop deployment, leaving the device on for extended periods is expected. With a full charge, you can expect the battery to last about 15 hours.\n\nEven when not in use, leave Stripe Reader S700 plugged in and powered on to receive automatic software updates.\n\n## Access settings ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nTo open the settings menu, swipe right from the left edge of the reader screen to reveal a **Settings** button. Tap the **Settings** button and enter the admin PIN `07139`. From here, you can update your WiFi settings or generate a pairing code for device registration. Battery status is displayed at the top right of this screen. To close the settings menu, click the back arrow in the top left corner.\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/s700-settings-button.6f47bb2572f4ac12b13286dde247ad88.png)\n\nSettings button\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/s700-admin-pin-screen.37e0ae6a621abb2c506db9ae762c8e91.png)\n\nAdmin PIN screen\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/s700-settings-menu.e03e2092089fa18470a353da3fdad707.png)\n\nSettings menu\n\n## Screen timeout![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe screen times out when the reader isn’t connected to a power source. The default timeout of 1 hour improves battery performance. To update this value, go to the [settings](#settings), select **Appearance**, then select a new screen timeout from the dropdown. The device screen turns on automatically after a device interaction occurs (such as touching the screen or picking up the device), or when the device enters the payments flow and a payment is initiated.\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/s700-settings-menu.e03e2092089fa18470a353da3fdad707.png)\n\nSettings menu\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/s700-appearance-menu.b83b814d09f1344e1407174e969def1c.png)\n\nAppearance menu\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/s700-settings-timeout.4fa38fc09ee1092d47eb737d46155a15.png)\n\nTimeout menu\n\n## Connect the reader to the internet![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nBecause the Stripe Reader S700 is a smart reader, its reader software communicates directly with Stripe. Your point of sale application communicates with the reader through either a LAN (using a Terminal SDK) or the internet (using the [server-driven integration](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/setup-integration?terminal-sdk-platform=server-driven)). When communicating with the reader through the LAN, the reader must connect to the same local network as your point of sale application. If you’re running into issues connecting your reader to the internet, follow the [troubleshooting steps](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/readers/stripe-reader-s700#troubleshooting) to diagnose the issue.\n\n### WiFi![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nTo connect to WiFi or switch networks, go to [settings](#settings), then select **WiFi settings** to choose the network and connect. Attempting to join a new network disconnects the reader from any existing wireless connection. See our [network requirements](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/network-requirements) for details about supported WiFi networks.\n\n### Ethernet and USB Peripherals![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nEthernet connectivity requires an optional hub, which provides wired 10/100 Ethernet connectivity and allows your smart reader to remain fully charged with the included charging cable. The hub also provides two USB-A ports to connect peripherals such as a barcode scanner and printer. The hub is compatible with the S700 Dock for countertop applications. You can purchase the hub and dock separately in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/terminal/shop).\n\nTo set up the hub:\n\n1.  Connect the Ethernet cable from your hub to your router.\n2.  Connect the hub to power through the built-in USB-C cable. We recommend using the power adapter included with your tripe Reader S700 to make sure the appropriate power is provided to the hub (27W) to power the reader and attached peripherals.\n3.  Connect the USB-C cable (provided with Stripe Reader S700) to the hub and reader when both cables are in place. The right-angle USB-C connector connects to the reader.\n\nTo confirm the reader’s Ethernet connectivity, verify that the reader is charging and check if the Ethernet icon is visible in the status bar.\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/wpe-battery-icon.d1e81d69ea61041f809e60d79e25be54.png)\n\nCharging icon\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/wpe-ethernet-icon.c5ae0533a503eb51ee9c8d587a854af0.png)\n\nEthernet icon\n\nThe reader obtains an IP address using DHCP. As soon as the network cable is plugged in, the reader attempts to establish communication with Stripe.\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/USB_Ethernet_Hub_with_Dock_and_S700.a26b62b93fad05b1dcc65f74341f3447.png)\n\nHub when used with Dock (sold separately)\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/USB_Ethernet_Hub_with_S700.03e29d9d225b2677b7f86da50926ec25.png)\n\nHub with peripherals. Ethernet connected and power connected to Stripe Reader S700.\n\nFor more information about these accessories, see [Stripe Reader S700 accessories](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/stripe-reader-s700/accessories).\n\n## Network priority![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe Stripe Reader S700 prioritizes connecting through Ethernet if possible. Even if previously configured for WiFi, the reader switches to using an Ethernet connection when connected to the dock with a plugged-in Ethernet cable. If you remove the reader from the dock, it switches back to the WiFi connection.\n\nThe Stripe Reader S700 resets its priority to Ethernet when rebooting. Even if previously configured for WiFi, the reader switches to Ethernet if it detects an Ethernet cable connection while starting up.\n\nIf you dock the reader, but you don’t have an Ethernet cable plugged in, it uses WiFi. Regardless of connectivity while docked, you can still connect to WiFi and manage networks on the device.\n\n## Change the UI appearance![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nBy default, the user interface of your Stripe Reader S700 reader uses a light theme.\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/s700-welcome-screen.903f1751a4041eefd1840d9a5d2f110f.png)\n\nWelcome screen\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/s700-payment-screen.4dd5fc4be4c989e6af7bd1b2a635ba5d.png)\n\nPayment screen\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/s700-processing-screen.f99410ddc0d26e095ffdda92e953e7ac.png)\n\nProcessing screen\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/s700-approved-screen.ae53ca99ba84aefbf2cb1aacf9ef1a2e.png)\n\nApproved screen\n\nYou can change the appearance of the UI to use a different theme in the settings menu.

When you purchase carbon removal, your company can help contribute to the world’s net zero carbon goals and help fund emerging carbon removal technologies.\n\nTo help you incorporate carbon removal into your climate offering, Frontier does the following for you:\n\n*   **Procures supply**: This requires establishing purchasing criteria, sourcing promising projects, and negotiating contracts.\n*   **Monitors supplier progress**: This includes monitoring supplier performance against key milestones.\n*   **Manages deliveries**: This includes validating delivery and retiring purchases.\n\n![Diagram describing the life cycle of a carbon removal order](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/frontier-diagram.9a70cf7ffa99c0589082ee922804e333.svg)\n\n## Procure supply![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nFrontier’s in-house team of experts and a group of [60+ technical reviewers](https://frontierclimate.com/who-we-are#section-technical-reviewers) source and vet all suppliers. We look for permanent carbon removal solutions that have the potential to be low-cost and high-volume in the future, even if they aren’t today.\n\nWe use these factors to make purchasing decisions:\n\n| Approach | Execution | Portfolio |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Does the carbon removal approach meet our target criteria? | Can this team deliver on the proposal, given where the technology is today? | Does this purchase help us build a diverse, risk-adjusted portfolio of carbon removal approaches? |\n\nSpecifically, Frontier focuses on technologies that meet the following criteria:\n\n| Criteria | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Durability | Store carbon permanently (>1,000 years) |\n| Physical footprint | Take advantage of carbon sinks and sources that don’t compete for arable land |\n| Cost | Have a path to being affordable at scale (<100 USD per ton) |\n| Capacity | Have a path to being a meaningful part of the carbon removal solution portfolio (>0.5 gigatons per year) |\n| Net negativity | Maximize net removal of atmospheric carbon dioxide |\n| Additionality | Result in net new carbon removed, rather than taking credit for removal that was already going to occur |\n| Verifiability | Have a published protocol that addresses key pathway uncertainties, has responded to scientific community feedback, and has a plan for independent verification of outcomes |\n| Safety and legality | Have a compelling case for why they don’t cause additional ecosystem damage or other ongoing externalities, has published ecosystem impact data and responded to feedback from the scientific community, and will actively manage the minimal remaining uncertainty within their deployments based on ongoing ecosystem monitoring |\n| Performance data | Have technology that has been validated by data obtained through a pilot deployment |\n| Community engagement | Have a community benefits plan and has proactively engaged stakeholders and incorporated feedback into their deployment plans |\n\nWe conduct diligence and sign long-term offtake agreements with the most promising suppliers that meet our criteria so that you don’t have to. Early offtakes are a unique way to buy carbon removal because they help projects start building today so that they can deliver tons in the near future.\n\nLearn more about [our available inventory](https://docs.stripe.com/climate/orders/carbon-removal-inventory).\n\n## Monitor supplier progress![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nBecause the carbon removal industry is in its early stages, it’s likely that some suppliers will be delayed or fail. Apart from conducting careful diligence, Frontier minimizes delivery delays and failures by actively monitoring progress against supplier-specific milestones, reallocating offtake agreements across suppliers as needed, and maintaining an inventory buffer.\n\n#### Note\n\nIf an order is delayed or fails, we’ll send you an email and the relevant webhook at least 60 days in advance.\n\n*   **Delays**. You’ll have the option of receiving a full refund or waiting for the tons to be delivered.\n*   **Individual supplier failures**. We’ll try to substitute your order with another similar supplier in the Frontier portfolio. Substituted carbon removal units might vary by pathway, geography, and price. If you don’t want a substitute, you can cancel the order and receive a full refund.\n\n## Manage deliveries![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nWhen Frontier receives the verified carbon removal from the supplier, the carbon removal units are retired on an independent third party registry. All deliveries are third party verified.\n\nAt the time of delivery, Frontier shares a delivery certificate and important details about the suppliers that fulfilled your order.\n\n![Preview of a carbon removal order certificate](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/frontier-certificate.377888457bcfecad08286964dd7e1751.svg)\n\nWhen possible, Frontier retires the carbon removal units on your behalf (or on behalf of your [beneficiary](https://docs.stripe.com/api/climate/order/object#climate_order_object-beneficiary_reference \"climate beneficiary\")). If we can’t name the buyer on the third party registry, we’ll retire orders in Frontier’s name.\n\nAfter delivery of your order, you can use your carbon removal units for net zero¹ or carbon neutrality claims.² You can’t make these claims prior to delivery.\n\n## Get started![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYou can purchase carbon removal programmatically using the Climate API or manually using the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/climate/orders).\n\n¹ The [Science Based Targets Initiative](https://sciencebasedtargets.org/) (SBTi) has become the de facto standard for companies setting net zero targets. SBTi [requires that,](https://sciencebasedtargets.org/resources/files/Net-Zero-Standard.pdf) to make a net zero claim, companies must (i) plan to reduce their current emissions by at least 90% relative to current levels, (ii) purchase permanent carbon removal—such as that being sold through the Climate API—on behalf of the remaining 10% of emissions, and (iii) support beyond value chain mitigation—a somewhat unclear concept that’s meant to capture all the various ways that companies can contribute to mitigating climate change or reducing its impacts outside of reducing their own emissions (or neutralizing them through permanent carbon removal purchases).\n\n² Carbon neutrality is somewhat poorly defined, but is generally claimed when a company purchases an amount of carbon credits (or carbon removal units) equal to their remaining emissions.",

[Prices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices) define how much and how frequently you charge for a product. This includes how much the product costs, what currency you accept, and whether it’s a one-time or recurring charge. If you only have a few products and prices, create and manage them in the Dashboard.\n\nThis guide uses a stock photo service as an example and charges customers a 100,000 KRW monthly subscription. To model this:\n\n1.  Navigate to the [Add a product](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/products/create) page.\n2.  Enter a **Name** for the product.\n3.  Enter **100,000** for the price.\n4.  Select **KRW** as the currency.\n5.  Click **Save product**.\n\nAfter you create the product and the price, record the price ID so you can use it in subsequent steps.

  "markdown": "# Bancontact payments with Sources | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Use Sources to accept payments using Bancontact, Belgium's most popular payment method.\n\n#### Warning\n\nWe deprecated the Sources API and plan to remove support for local payment methods. If you currently integrate with Bancontact using the Sources API, you must [migrate to the Payment Methods API](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/transitioning). We’ll send email communication with more information about this end of support.\n\nFor information about integrating Bancontact with the current APIs, see [Bancontact payments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/bancontact).\n\nStripe users in Europe and the United States can accept [Bancontact](https://www.bancontact.com/) payments from customers in Belgium using [Sources](https://docs.stripe.com/sources).\n\nDuring the payment process, a [Source](https://docs.stripe.com/api#sources) object is created and your customer is redirected to their bank’s website or mobile application to authorize the payment. After completing this, your integration uses the source to make a charge request and complete the payment.\n\nBancontact is a [push](https://docs.stripe.com/sources#pull-or-push-of-funds)\\-based, [single-use](https://docs.stripe.com/sources#single-use-or-reusable) and [synchronous](https://docs.stripe.com/sources#synchronous-or-asynchronous-confirmation) method of payment. This means your customer takes action to send the amount to you through a [redirect](https://docs.stripe.com/sources#flow-for-customer-action) and there is immediate confirmation about the success or failure of a payment.\n\n[\n\n## Create a Source object![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n\n\n](#create-source)\n\nA `Source` object is either created client-side using [Stripe.js](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/elements) or server-side using the [Source creation endpoint](https://docs.stripe.com/api#create_source), with the following parameters:\n\n| Parameter | Value |\n| --- | --- |\n| `type` | **bancontact** |\n| `amount` | A positive integer in the [smallest currency unit](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#zero-decimal) representing the amount to charge the customer (for example, **1099** for a 10.99 EUR payment). The charge amount must be at least 1 EUR or its equivalent in the given currency. |\n| `bancontact[preferred_language]` (optional) | The preferred language of the Bancontact authorization page that the customer is redirected to. Supported values are: **en**, **de**, **fr**, or **nl**. |\n| `currency` | **eur** (Bancontact must always use Euros) |\n| `owner[name]` | The full name of the account holder. |\n| `redirect[return_url]` | The URL the customer should be redirected to after the authorization process. |\n| `statement_descriptor` (optional) | A custom statement descriptor for the payment. |\n\nTo create a source with [Stripe.js](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/elements), first include the library within your website and set your [publishable API key](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys). Once included, use the following `createSource` method to create a source client-side:\n\n`stripe.createSource({   type: 'bancontact',   amount: 1099,   currency: 'eur',   owner: {     name: 'Jenny Rosen',   },   redirect: {     return_url: '__TOKEN_PLACEHOLDER_0__',   }, }).then(function(result) {   // handle result.error or result.source });`\n\nUsing either method, Stripe returns a `Source` object containing the relevant details for the method of payment used. Information specific to Bancontact is provided within the `bancontact` subhash.\n\n`{   \"id\": \"src_16xhynE8WzK49JbAs9M21jaR\",   \"object\": \"source\",   \"amount\": 1099,   \"client_secret\": \"src_client_secret_UfwvW2WHpZ0s3QEn9g5x7waU\",   \"created\": 1445277809,   \"currency\": \"eur\",   \"statement_descriptor\": null,   \"flow\": \"redirect\",   \"livemode\": true,`\n\n### Source creation in mobile applications![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nIf you’re building an iOS or Android app, you can implement sources using our mobile SDKs. Refer to our sources documentation for [iOS](https://docs.stripe.com/mobile/ios/sources) or [Android](https://docs.stripe.com/mobile/android/sources) to learn more.\n\n### Optional: Providing a custom statement descriptor ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nBancontact requires a [statement descriptor](https://support.stripe.com/questions/when-i-charge-a-customer-what-will-they-see-on-their-card-statements) before the customer is redirected to authenticate the payment. By default, your Stripe account’s statement descriptor is used (you can review this in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/public)). You can provide a custom descriptor by specifying `statement_descriptor` when creating a source. Bancontact statement descriptors support a maximum of 35 characters.\n\n`stripe.createSource({   type: 'bancontact',   amount: 1099,   currency: 'eur',   statement_descriptor: 'ORDER AT11990',   owner: {     name: 'Jenny Rosen',   },   redirect: {     return_url: '__TOKEN_PLACEHOLDER_0__',   }, }).then(function(result) {   // handle result.error or result.source });`\n\nProviding a custom statement descriptor within a subsequent charge request has no effect.\n\n### Error codes![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nSource creation for Bancontact payments may return any of the following errors:\n\n| Error | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `payment_method_not_available` | The payment method is currently not available. You should invite your customer to fallback to another payment method to proceed. |\n| `processing_error` | An unexpected error occurred preventing us from creating the source. The source creation should be retried. |\n| `invalid_owner_name` | The owner name is invalid. It must be at least three characters in length. |\n\n[\n\n## Have the customer authorize the payment![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n\n\n](#customer-action)\n\nWhen creating a source, its status is initially set to `pending` and cannot yet be used to make a charge request. Your customer must authorize a Bancontact payment to make the source chargeable. To allow your customer to authorize the payment, redirect them to the URL provided within the`redirect[url]` attribute of the `Source` object.\n\nAfter the authorization process, your customer is redirected back to the URL provided as a value of `redirect[return_url]`. This happens regardless of whether authorization was successful or not. If the customer has authorized the payment, the `Source` object’s status is updated to `chargeable` and it is ready to use in a charge request. If your customer declines the payment, the status transitions to `failed`.\n\nStripe populates the `redirect[return_url]` with the following GET parameters when returning your customer to your website:\n\n*   `source`: a string representing the original ID of the `Source` object\n*   `livemode`: indicates if this is a live payment, either `true` or `false`\n*   `client_secret`: used to confirm that the returning customer is the same one who triggered the creation of the source (source IDs are not considered secret)\n\nYou may include any other GET parameters you may need when specifying `redirect[return_url]`. Do not use the above as parameter names yourself as these would be overridden with the values we populate.\n\n### Mobile applications![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nTo integrate Bancontact within a mobile application, provide your application URI scheme as the `redirect[return_url]` value. By doing so, your customers are returned to your app after completing authorization. Refer to our Sources documentation for [iOS](https://docs.stripe.com/mobile/ios/sources) or [Android](https://docs.stripe.com/mobile/android/sources) to learn more.\n\nIf you are integrating without using our mobile SDKs, the redirect URL must be opened using the device’s native browser. The use of in-app web views and containers can prevent your customer from completing authentication—resulting in a lower conversion rate.\n\n### Testing the redirect process![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nWhen creating a `Source` object using your test API keys, you can follow the URL returned in the `redirect[url]` field. This leads to a Stripe page that displays information about the API request, and where you can either authorize or cancel the payment. Authorizing the payment redirects you to the URL specified in `redirect[return_url]`.\n\nAlternatively, to accelerate testing, use the following value for `owner[email]`, where `xxx_` is any prefix of your choice (these patterns are significant only in testmode):\n\n| Email Address | Effect |\n| --- | --- |\n| `xxx_chargeable@example.com` | The source will be created as `pending`, but automatically transition to `chargeable` within seconds of its creation. |\n\n[\n\n## Charge the Source![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n\n\n](#charge-request)\n\nOnce the customer has authenticated the payment, the source’s `status` transitions to `chargeable` and it can be used to make a charge request. This transition happens asynchronously and may occur after the customer was redirected back to your website.\n\nSome customers using Bancontact assume that the order process is complete once they have authenticated the payment and received confirmation from their bank. This results in customers who close their browser instead of following the redirect and returning to your app or website.\n\nFor these reasons it is essential that your integration rely on [webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks \"webhook\") to determine when the source becomes chargeable in order to create a charge. Please refer to our [best practices](https://docs.stripe.com/sources/best-practices) for more details on how to best integrate payment methods using webhooks.\n\n### Webhooks![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe following webhook events are also sent to notify you about changes to the source’s status:\n\n| Event | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `source.chargeable` | A `Source` object becomes `chargeable` after a customer has authenticated and verified a payment. |\n| `source.failed` | A `Source` object failed to become chargeable as your customer declined to authenticate the payment. |\n| `source.canceled` | A `Source` object expired and cannot be used to create a charge. |\n\n### Make a charge request using the source![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nOnce the source is chargeable, from your `source.chargeable` webhook handler, you can make a charge request using the source ID as the value for the `source` parameter to complete the payment.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/charges \\   -u` \n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`: \\   -d amount=\"1099\" \\   -d currency=\"eur\" \\   -d source=src_18eYalAHEMiOZZp1l9ZTjSU0`\n\nBancontact Sources are [single-use](https://docs.stripe.com/sources#single-use-or-reusable) and cannot be used for recurring or additional payments.\n\nRefer to our [Sources & Customers](https://docs.stripe.com/sources/customers) guide for more information on how single-use Sources interact with [Customers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers \"Customers\").\n\n[\n\n## Confirm that the charge has succeeded![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n\n\n](#charge-confirmation)\n\nSince Bancontact is a [synchronous](https://docs.stripe.com/sources#synchronous-or-asynchronous-confirmation) payment method and the customer has already authenticated the payment as part of the redirect, unless there is an unexpected error, the [Charge](https://docs.stripe.com/api#charge_object) will immediately succeed.\n\nYou will also receive the following webhook event as the charge is created:\n\n| Event | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `charge.succeeded` | The charge succeeded and the payment is complete. |\n\nWe recommend that you rely on the `charge.succeeded` webhook event to notify your customer that the payment process has been completed and their order is confirmed. Please refer to our [best practices](https://docs.stripe.com/sources/best-practices) for more details on how to best integrate payment methods using webhooks.\n\n### Disputed payments![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe risk of fraud or unrecognized payments is extremely low with Bancontact as the customer must authenticate the payment with their bank. As such, there is no dispute process that can result in a chargeback and funds withdrawn from your Stripe account.\n\n### Refunds![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nPayments made with Bancontact can only be submitted for refund within 180 days from the date of the original charge. After 180 days, it is no longer possible to refund the charge.\n\n### Source expiration![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nA source must be used within six hours of becoming `chargeable`. If it is not, its status is automatically transitioned to `canceled` and your integration receives a `source.canceled` webhook event. Additionally, `pending` sources are canceled after one hour if they are not used to authenticate a payment.\n\nOnce a source is canceled, the customer’s authenticated payment is refunded automatically—no money is moved into your account. For this reason, make sure the order is canceled on your end and the customer is notified once you receive the `source.canceled` event.",

  "markdown": "# Copy PAN data across Stripe accounts\n\n## Securely copy sensitive primary account number data within Stripe.\n\nStripe’s self-serve data copy service allows you to copy customer and payment data from one Stripe account to another Stripe account in the Dashboard.\n\nA data copy involves two parties: the sender account and the recipient account.\n\n*   **Sender account**: The Stripe account currently storing the customer data. This is the account to copy the data from.\n*   **Recipient account**: The Stripe account where you want to store the customer data. This is the account to copy the data to.\n\nBefore beginning the copying process, the sender and the recipient must provide their account IDs to each other. If you’re the sender account, work with a user of the recipient account to share account IDs. If you’re the recipient account, work with a user of the sender account to share account IDs. Find your account ID by going to the [User settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/user) in the Dashboard while logged into your account.\n\n## Data copying considerations ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nConsider the following when copying data to a new account:\n\n*   We can only copy data from one account to another. We can’t merge or move the data. After it’s complete, the copied data exists on both the destination and source accounts.\n    \n*   We only copy the raw [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object) objects and associated payment data objects. The supported payment methods include:\n    \n    *   Cards stored as [Card](https://docs.stripe.com/api/cards/object) objects\n    *   Cards stored as [Source](https://docs.stripe.com/api/sources/object) objects\n    *   Cards stored as [Payment method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods/object) objects\n    *   US ACH records stored as [Bank account](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customer_bank_accounts/object) objects\n*   We can’t copy Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA), BACs, or ACH records stored as payment method objects at this time.\n    \n*   We can’t copy individual [Charges](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/object), [PaymentIntents](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object), [Invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/object), [Plans](https://docs.stripe.com/api/plans/object), [Subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/object), [Coupons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/coupons/object), [Events](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/object), Logs, [Guest customers](https://support.stripe.com/questions/guest-customer-faq), or any other Stripe objects.\n    \n*   The copy operation doesn’t change customer IDs, resulting in the same IDs for customers in both the destination and source account data.\n    \n*   The copy process assigns new object IDs of the same payment type to payment data. For example, the process assigns a new card object ID to all card objects and new payment method object IDs to all payment method objects. After the copy process is complete, Stripe creates and uploads a CSV mapping file to the **Documents** section of the recipient’s Dashboard. The mapping file is available to the recipient only. The mapping file contains the following headers:\n    \n    *   `customer_id_old`\n    *   `source_id_old`\n    *   `customer_id_new`\n    *   `source_id_new`\n    \n    Customer IDs don’t change during the copying process, so `customer_id_old` and `customer_id_new` have the same value after the copy finishes. `source_id_old` is the old payment method ID from the sharing account, and `source_id_new` is the new payment method ID from the recipient account.\n    \n*   Source account data remains intact. We recommend keeping the original source account as a backup for your data.\n    \n*   The recipient account must be an activated account. To activate the account, log in to the Dashboard and follow the prompts at the top-left of the home screen to activate payments.\n    \n*   You can’t copy deleted customers from the sharing account to the recipient account. After you delete a Customer, there’s no way to restore that customer.\n    \n*   If you delete a customer in the recipient account, a second copy doesn’t restore that customer.\n    \n*   During a second copy involving the same accounts and same customers, previously-copied Customer objects aren’t duplicated. The second copy copies over brand new Stripe Customer objects or new payment methods only for previously-copied Customer objects. If you delete a customer in the account, re-copying that customer from the sharing account doesn’t restore that customer.\n    \n*   The copy includes only Stripe Customer objects (`cus_xxx`). We can’t copy Guest (`gcus_xxxx`) customers—see [Guest customers](https://support.stripe.com/questions/guest-customer-faq) to learn more. Sender accounts must have Customer objects stored to process a data copy.\n    \n*   Accounts can perform up to 50 copies per day. Stripe limits copies to unauthorized accounts to one copy until the recipient account authorizes the first copy request.\n    \n*   If any expired cards are included in the records that you copy over to the destination account, there’s the possibility that [Card Account Updater](https://stripe.com/guides/optimizing-authorization-rates#card-account-updater) (CAU)—if turned on for the destination account—will communicate with the card networks to automatically update these cards. This can result in additional CAU fees for the destination account. To avoid the possibility of CAU fees related to a self-serve copy, the destination account team must work with the source account team to make sure that no expired cards are included in the copy data set.\n    \n\n## Full or partial copy ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nYou can perform a full or partial copy. A full copy sends all customers from the sender account. A partial copy sends a subset of customers from the sender account.\n\nA partial copy entails sending a subset of customers from the sender account to the recipient account. There are two ways to complete a partial copy:\n\n*   **Select customers in the Dashboard**: Recommended for copies of less than 15 customers\n*   **Upload a CSV file with a list of customer IDs**: Recommended for copies of more than 15 customers\n\nYou need to complete three steps for a full data copy:\n\n1.  The sender shares their customer data with the recipient.\n2.  The recipient authorizes and accepts the customer data from the sender.\n3.  The copying process finishes.\n\n1.  The sender logs into their [Stripe account](https://dashboard.stripe.com/login) and navigates to the [Customers](https://dashboard.stripe.com/customers) page.\n2.  They click **Copy customers**.\n3.  In the **Copy Method** field, they click **Copy all customers**.\n4.  They enter the account ID (`acct_xxxx`) of the recipient account and click **Continue**. If they haven’t previously shared customers with this recipient account, they receive a message stating that the recipient needs to authorize your request before the copy occurs.\n5.  They click **Confirm**.\n6.  After successfully sharing the data with the recipient, the sender can see the pending copy request at the top of their Customers page.\n\nThe recipient logs into their [Stripe account](https://dashboard.stripe.com/login) and navigates to the [Customers page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/customers), where they see a banner at the top advising that the sender wants to share their data. The recipient clicks **Authorize and Accept**.\n\n## The copying process finishes![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nAfter the sender completes the previous steps, the copy begins processing. The sender and recipient can see the in-progress copy banner at the top of the Customers page in the Dashboard.\n\nMost data copies finish within 72 hours, after the sender shares the customer data with the recipient and the recipient authorizes and accepts the customer data from the sender. Copies of fewer than 10,000 customers typically complete within a couple of hours.\n\nWhen the copying process is complete, the sender and recipient can see the completed copy banner at the top of the Customers page in the Dashboard. The recipient has the option to download the mapping file.\n\n## Copy into or out of a Connect account![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nIf the sender account is a Connect account without access to the Stripe Dashboard, reach out to your contact at the Platform to let them know you need a data copy. The Platform account owner or Data Migration Specialist needs to follow these steps:\n\nPartial copy with customer selection isn’t available for Connect accounts.\n\n1.  The Platform account owner or Data Migration Specialist logs into their Stripe account and navigates to the [Connect](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/accounts/overview) page.\n2.  The sender locates and selects the correct Connect account where the customers are stored.\n3.  They navigate to the Customers section within the Connect account.\n4.  They click **Copy customers**.\n5.  In the **Copy Method** field, they click **Copy all customers**.\n6.  They enter the account ID (format: acct\\_xxxx) of the recipient account and click **Continue**. If they haven’t previously shared customers with this recipient account, they receive a message stating that the recipient needs to authorize your request before the copy occurs.\n7.  They click **Confirm**. After successfully sharing the data with the recipient, they can see the pending copy request at the top of the Customers page within the Connect account.\n8.  The recipient follows standard steps for authorizing and accepting customer data.\n\nIf the recipient account is a Connect account that doesn’t have access to the Stripe Dashboard, reach out to your contact at the Platform to let them know you need a data copy.\n\nThe Platform account owner, Admin, or Data Migration Specialist need to authorize and accept customer data from the sender after the sender shares it.\n\nTo authorize the data, the recipient logs into the Platform Stripe account, navigates to the Connect page, locates the Connect account where the customers were shared, and clicks **Authorize and Accept** on the banner in the Customers section.\n\nIf your customers are stored in a Platform account that you don’t own, inform your contact at the Platform that you need a data copy. Direct them to follow the steps to share your customers with the recipient account. Platform accounts typically store customers for several unrelated Connected accounts. Make sure the Platform account shares only your customers, by following the steps to do a partial copy.\n\n## Status page![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nIf you’re an account owner or data migration specialist, you can view in-progress and completed copies by going to the Customers page and selecting **Copy customers** then **Status page**. You can toggle between **Shared** data and **Received** data.\n\nFor all other roles, you can view in-progress and complete copies on the [copy status page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/copy-status).\n\n### Shared![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nOn the Shared tab, you can see copies where your account was the sender account, sharing your customers to other accounts.\n\n**In progress** copies are copies that are currently processing or where the sender account has initiated the copy, but the recipient hasn’t authorized and accepted it. For **Pending** copies, the recipient needs to authorize and accept the copy to proceed. Most **In progress** copies finish within 72 hours. Copies of fewer than 10,000 customers typically complete within a couple of hours.\n\n**Previously shared** copies are copies that were successful or canceled from your account to another.\n\n### Received![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nOn the Received tab, you can see copies where your account was the recipient account, receiving customers from other accounts.\n\n**In progress** copies are copies that are currently processing or where the sender account has initiated the copy, but you as the recipient haven’t authorized and accepted it. For **Pending** copies, you need to authorize and accept the copy to proceed. Most **In progress** copies in this state finish within 72 hours. Copies of fewer than 10,000 customers typically complete within a couple of hours.\n\n**Previously shared with you** copies are copies that were successful or canceled from another account to your account.\n\n**Sharing permissions** are the accounts that have previously shared their customers with you. For any future copies from these accounts to yours, the sender account still needs to share customer data with you, and you still need to accept the data. Authorized accounts see your business name when they enter your account ID during the sharing step.\n\n**View all** navigates to the Authorized accounts page, which shows the accounts authorized to send you their data. You still need to accept the data copy requests from these accounts, but these accounts now have the ability to see your business name when they enter your account ID during the sharing step. You can revoke permission from any accounts in this list, which prevents them from seeing your business name during the sharing process. When revoked, future copy requests must be authorized and accepted. Only account owners, admins, and data migration specialists can add and revoke authorized accounts.\n\n## Permissions restrictions![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nOnly the account owner or a Data Migration Specialist can perform actions from the sender account. Only the account owner, an account admin, or a Data Migration Specialist can perform actions from the recipient account.\n\nLearn how to [add a team member as a Data Migration Specialist](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/teams/roles).\n\n## India account considerations![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nData copies aren’t permitted between India Stripe accounts and accounts outside of India. There are regulations in India that require local storage of certain payments data. As part of our continued investment in India and to meet these requirements, we’re updating our systems and have reviewed the data migrations we offer to Stripe users. The data storage requirements prevent us from proceeding with the data copy you’ve requested. If you attempt to complete a copy between an India Stripe account and an account outside of India, you receive an error message that says copying isn’t permissible.\n\n#### Note\n\n## Get Stripe support![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nIf you run into issues or have any questions when completing the data copy, contact the Data Migration Team with this [intake form](https://support.stripe.com/contact/email?topic=migrations). You must be logged in to your Stripe account before clicking this link.\n\nIn the intake form, for migration type, select **Tell us about your other data migration use case**, and fill out the form accordingly. If you’ve already initiated a data copy, provide the migration request ID associated with the copy request. The migration request ID is in the pending banner or the status page.",

  "markdown": "# Build a custom checkout page that includes Link\n\n## Integrate Link using the Payment Element or Link Authentication Element.\n\nThis guide walks you through how to accept payments with [Link](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link/what-is-link) using the [Payment Intents API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents) and either the [Payment Element](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-element) or [Link Authentication Element](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/elements/link-authentication-element).\n\nThere are three ways you can secure a customer email address for Link authentication and enrollment:\n\n*   **Pass in an email address:** You can pass an email address to the Payment Element using [defaultValues](https://docs.stripe.com/js/elements_object/create_payment_element#payment_element_create-options-defaultValues). If you’re already collecting the email address and or customer’s phone number in the checkout flow, we recommend this approach.\n*   **Collect an email address:** You can collect an email address directly in the Payment Element. If you’re not collecting the email address anywhere in the checkout flow, we recommend this approach.\n*   **Link Authentication Element:** You can use the Link Authentication Element to create a single email input field for both email collection and Link authentication. We recommend doing this if you use the [Address Element](https://docs.stripe.com/elements/address-element).\n\n![Authenticate or enroll with Link directly in the Payment Element during checkout](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/link-in-pe.2efb5138a4708b781b8a913ebddd9aba.png)\n\nCollect a customer email address for Link authentication or enrollment\n\n[](#set-up-stripe)\n\nFirst, [create a Stripe account](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register) or [sign in](https://dashboard.stripe.com/login).\n\nUse our official libraries to access the Stripe API from your application:\n\n`# Available as a gem sudo gem install stripe`\n\n`# If you use bundler, you can add this line to your Gemfile gem 'stripe'`\n\n[](#web-create-intent)\n\nStripe uses a [PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents) object to represent your intent to collect payment from a customer, tracking charge attempts and payment state changes throughout the process.\n\n![An overview diagram of the entire payment flow](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/accept-a-payment-payment-element.5cf6795a02f864923f9953611493d735.svg)\n\nYou can accept payments with Link using information your customer stores in the Link app. Because you don’t use the Link `payment_method.type`, when you receive a payment from a customer using Link in the Payment Element, the `payment_method.type` listed for the payment is `card`.\n\nTo use the Link `payment_method.type`, update your integration to set `payment_method_types` to `link`. Alternatively, you can set `automatic_payment_methods` to `enabled` and let Stripe dynamically display the most relevant payment methods to your customers.\n\nCreate a PaymentIntent on your server with an amount and currency, and `payment_method_types` set to `link` and any other payment methods you want to accept. Always decide how much to charge on the server side (a trusted environment) instead of the client. This prevents malicious customers from choosing their own prices.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/payment_intents \\   -u` \n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`: \\   -d \"amount\"=1099 \\   -d \"currency\"=\"usd\" \\   -d \"automatic_payment_methods[enabled]\"=true`\n\n### Retrieve the client secret![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe PaymentIntent includes a [client secret](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-client_secret \"PaymentIntent client secret\") that the client side uses to securely complete the payment process. You can use different approaches to pass the client secret to the client side.\n\nRetrieve the client secret from an endpoint on your server, using the browser’s `fetch` function. This approach is best if your client side is a single-page application, particularly one built with a modern frontend framework like React. Create the server endpoint that serves the client secret:\n\n`get '/secret' do   intent = # ... Create or retrieve the PaymentIntent   {client_secret: intent.client_secret}.to_json end`\n\nAnd then fetch the client secret with JavaScript on the client side:\n\n`(async () => {   const response = await fetch('/secret');   const {client_secret: clientSecret} = await response.json();   // Render the form using the clientSecret })();`\n\n[](#design-your-integration)\n\nLink authenticates a customer by using their email address. Depending on your checkout flow, you have the following options: pass an email to the Payment Element, collect it directly within the Payment Element, or use the Link Authentication Element. Of these, Stripe recommends passing a customer email address to the Payment Element if available.\n\nLink authentication in the Payment Element allows your customers to enter an email address directly in the Payment Element with no additional integration work required.\n\nIn this flow, your customer enters their email address and authenticates or enrolls with Link directly in the Payment Element during checkout. If a customer hasn’t enrolled with Link and they choose a supported payment method in the Payment Element, they’re prompted to save their details using Link. For those who have already enrolled, Link automatically populates their payment information.\n\n[](#web-collect-payment-details)\n\nNow you can set up your custom payment form with the Elements prebuilt UI components. Your payment page address must start with `https://` rather than `http://` for your integration to work. You can test your integration without using HTTPS. [Enable HTTPS](https://docs.stripe.com/security/guide#tls) when you’re ready to accept live payments.\n\nThe Payment Element renders a prefilled customer contact form that includes the phone number and email address. It also renders a dynamic form that allows your customer to pick a payment method type. This form automatically collects all necessary payments details for the payment method type selected by the customer.\n\nWhat’s more, the Payment Element handles the display of Link-saved payment methods for authenticated customers. For this integration, you must leave Link turned on in your [Payment methods settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods).\n\n### Set up Stripe Elements ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nInstall React Stripe.js and the Stripe.js loader from the [npm public registry](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@stripe/react-stripe-js):\n\n`npm install --save @stripe/react-stripe-js @stripe/stripe-js`\n\n### Build the payment form ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nOn your payment page, wrap your payment form with the `Elements` component, passing the [client secret](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-client_secret).\n\nIf you have other customer information, pass it to the `defaultValues.billingDetails` object for the `PaymentElement`. Prefilling as much information as possible simplifies Link account creation and reuse for your customers. You can also pass in the [appearance object](https://docs.stripe.com/js/elements_object/update#elements_update-options-appearance), customizing the Elements to match the design of your site.\n\nThen, render `PaymentElement` in your payment form. You need to pass in the [defaultValues](https://docs.stripe.com/js/elements_object/create_payment_element#payment_element_create-options-defaultValues) option with at least the customer’s email address to prefill their data for Link.\n\n`import {loadStripe} from \"@stripe/stripe-js\"; import {   Elements,   PaymentElement, } from \"@stripe/react-stripe-js\";  const stripe = loadStripe(`\n\n`'pk_test_TYooMQauvdEDq54NiTphI7jx'`\n\n`);  // Customize the appearance of Elements using the Appearance API. const appearance = {/* ... */};  const CheckoutPage = ({clientSecret}) => (   <Elements stripe={stripe} options={{clientSecret, appearance}}>     <CheckoutForm />   </Elements> );  export default function CheckoutForm() {   return (     <form>       <h3>Payment</h3>        // Create the Payment Element       <PaymentElement/>       <button type=\"submit\">Submit</button>     </form>   ); }`\n\n[](#web-submit-payment)\n\nUse [stripe.confirmPayment](https://docs.stripe.com/js/payment_intents/confirm_payment) to complete the payment with details collected from your customer in the different Elements forms. Provide a [return\\_url](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-return_url) to this function to indicate where Stripe redirects the user after they complete the payment.\n\nYour user might be first redirected to an intermediate site, like a bank authorization page, before Stripe redirects them to the `return_url`.\n\nBy default, card and bank payments immediately redirect to the `return_url` when a payment is successful. If you don’t want to redirect to the `return_url`, you can use [`if_required`](https://docs.stripe.com/js/payment_intents/confirm_payment#confirm_payment_intent-options-redirect) to change the behavior.\n\n`import {loadStripe} from \"@stripe/stripe-js\"; import {   useStripe,   useElements,   Elements,   LinkAuthenticationElement,   PaymentElement,   // If collecting shipping   AddressElement, } from \"@stripe/react-stripe-js\";  const stripe = loadStripe(`\n\n`'pk_test_TYooMQauvdEDq54NiTphI7jx'`\n\n`);  const appearance = {/* ... */};  // Enable the skeleton loader UI for the optimal loading experience. const loader = 'auto';  const CheckoutPage =({clientSecret}) => (   <Elements stripe={stripe} options={{clientSecret, appearance, loader}}>     <CheckoutForm />   </Elements> );  export default function CheckoutForm() {   const stripe = useStripe();   const elements = useElements();    const handleSubmit = async (event) => {     event.preventDefault();      const {error} = await stripe.confirmPayment({       elements,       confirmParams: {         return_url: \"[https://example.com/order/123/complete](https://example.com/order/123/complete)\",       },     });      if (error) {       // handle error     }   };    return (     <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>       <h3>Contact info</h3>       <LinkAuthenticationElement />       {/* If collecting shipping */}       <h3>Shipping</h3>       <AddressElement options={{mode: 'shipping', allowedCountries: ['US']}} />       <h3>Payment</h3>       <PaymentElement />        <button type=\"submit\">Submit</button>     </form>   ); }`\n\nThe `return_url` corresponds to a page on your website that provides [the payment status](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents/verifying-status) of the `PaymentIntent` when you render the return page. When Stripe redirects the customer to the `return_url`, you can use the following URL query parameters to verify payment status. You can also append your own query parameters when providing the `return_url`. These query parameters persist through the redirect process.\n\n| Parameter | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `payment_intent` | The unique identifier for the `PaymentIntent` |\n| `payment_intent_client_secret` | The [client secret](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-client_secret) of the `PaymentIntent` object. |\n\n[](#web-post-payment)\n\nStripe sends a [payment\\_intent.succeeded](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-payment_intent.succeeded) event when the payment completes. [Use a webhook to receive these events](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks/quickstart) and run actions, like sending an order confirmation email to your customer, logging the sale in a database, or starting a shipping workflow.\n\nConfigure your integration to listen for these events rather than waiting on a callback from the client. When you wait on a callback from the client, the customer can close the browser window or quit the app before the callback executes. Setting up your integration to listen for asynchronous events enables you to accept [different types of payment methods](https://stripe.com/payments/payment-methods-guide) with a single integration.\n\nIn addition to handling the `payment_intent.succeeded` event, you can also handle two other important events when collecting payments with the Payment Element:\n\n| Event | Description | Action |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| [payment\\_intent.succeeded](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types?lang=php#event_types-payment_intent.succeeded) | Sent from Stripe when a customer has successfully completed a payment. | Send the customer an order confirmation and fulfill their order. |\n| [payment\\_intent.payment\\_failed](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types?lang=php#event_types-payment_intent.payment_failed) | Sent from Stripe when a customer attempted a payment, but the payment didn’t succeed. | If a payment transitioned from `processing` to `payment_failed`, offer the customer another attempt to pay. |\n\n[](#web-test-the-integration)\n\n#### Caution\n\nDon’t store real user data in [test mode](https://docs.stripe.com/test-mode \"test mode\") Link accounts. Treat them as if they’re publicly available, because these test accounts are associated with your publishable key.\n\nCurrently, Link only works with credit cards, debit cards, and qualified US bank account purchases. Link requires [domain registration](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/pmd-registration).\n\nYou can create test mode accounts for Link using any valid email address. The following table shows the fixed one-time passcode values that Stripe accepts for authenticating test mode accounts:\n\n| Value | Outcome |\n| --- | --- |\n| Any other 6 digits not listed below | Success |\n| 000001 | Error, code invalid |\n| 000002 | Error, code expired |\n| 000003 | Error, max attempts exceeded |\n\nFor testing specific payment methods, refer to the [Payment Element testing examples](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=web#additional-testing-resources).\n\n### Multiple funding sources![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nAs Stripe adds additional funding source support, you don’t need to update your integration. Stripe automatically supports them with the same transaction settlement time and guarantees as card and bank account payments.\n\n### Card authentication and 3D Secure![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nLink supports [3D Secure 2 (3DS2)](https://stripe.com/guides/3d-secure-2 \"3D Secure 2 (3DS2)\") authentication for card payments. 3DS2 requires customers to complete an additional verification step with the card issuer when paying. Payments that have been successfully authenticated using 3D Secure are covered by a liability shift.\n\nTo trigger 3DS2 authentication challenge flows with Link in test mode, use the following test card with any CVC, postal code, and future expiration date: .\n\nIn test mode, the authentication process displays a mock authentication page. On that page, you can either authorize or cancel the payment. Authorizing the payment simulates successful authentication and redirects you to the specified return URL. Clicking the **Failure** button simulates an unsuccessful attempt at authentication.\n\nFor more details, refer to the [3D Secure authentication page](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure).\n\n#### Note\n\nWhen testing 3DS flows, only test cards for 3DS2 will trigger authentication on Link.\n\n[](#disclose-cookies)\n\nStripe collects information on customer interactions with Elements to provide services to you, prevent fraud, and improve its services. This includes using cookies and IP addresses to identify which Elements a customer saw during a single checkout session.

The next command from the previously-connected SDK fails with a reader error, and that app’s `onUnexpectedReaderDisconnect` method is called. | The incoming connection fails with a reader error. The existing SDK-to-reader connection does not break and the command in progress continues. |\n\nFor the least-disruptive connection experience in multi-reader environments, we recommend setting `failIfInUse` to `true` on your application’s initial connection attempt. Then, allow your users to retry the connection with `failIfInUse` set to `false` if the connection fails the first time. With this setup, one of your users can’t accidentally interrupt a transaction by inadvertently connecting to an in-use reader, but can still connect if needed.\n\n### Handle disconnects ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nYour app must implement the `UnexpectedReaderDisconnect` callback to handle when a reader is disconnected.\n\nWhen you implement this callback, display a UI that notifies your user of the disconnected reader. You can call `discoverReaders` to scan for readers and initiate reconnection. Your app can attempt to automatically reconnect to the disconnected reader or display a UI that prompts your user to reconnect to a different reader.\n\nThe reader can disconnect from your app if it loses connection to the network. To simulate an unexpected disconnect, power off the reader.\n\n`class ReaderActivity : AppCompatActivity(), TerminalListener {    // ...    Terminal.getInstance().setTerminalListener(this)    // TerminalListener   override fun onUnexpectedReaderDisconnect(reader: Reader) {     // Consider displaying a UI to notify the user and start rediscovering readers   } }`\n\n### Automatic reconnection![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nStripe Terminal doesn’t automatically reconnect to a reader when your application starts. Instead, you can build a reconnection flow by storing reader IDs and attempting to connect to a known reader on startup.\n\n1.  When you successfully connect to a reader, save its serial number in a persistent data storage location, such as the [Shared Preferences API](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/shared-preferences) (Android).\n2.  When your app launches, check that persistent store for a saved serial number. If one is found, call the `discoverReaders` method so your application can try to find that reader again.\n3.  If the saved serial number matches any of the discovered readers, try connecting to that reader with the matching reader object returned from the call to `discoverReaders`. If the previously connected reader isn’t found, stop the discovery process.\n\nDisplay some UI during the discovery and connection process to indicate that an automatic reconnection is taking place.",

  "markdown": "# Collect card payments while offline\n\nThe Terminal SDK allows your application to continue collecting payments using a smart reader without an Internet connection.\n\nIf you’re using a separate POS device with a Stripe smart reader, you still need a functioning local network to allow your POS device to communicate with the smart reader. Operating offline with smart readers is for scenarios where your POS and reader can’t communicate with Stripe, such as during an ISP outage. If you need to be able to operate offline without a local network, consider Stripe Terminal’s [mobile readers](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/bluetooth-readers).\n\nYou can also operate offline with an [Apps on Devices](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/features/apps-on-devices/overview) integration. Since your POS application runs directly on the smart reader, you don’t need a local network to collect payments. However, you still need to be on a local network when your reader first boots up, even if the network doesn’t have access to the Internet.\n\n#### Warning\n\nWhen operating offline, payment information is collected at the time of sale, and authorization is only attempted after connectivity is restored and the payment is forwarded. You, as the user, assume all decline risk of the transaction. If the issuer declines the offline transaction, there’s no way to recover the funds, and you might not receive payment from the customer for goods or services already provided.\n\nTo reduce the chances of an issuer decline, you’re encouraged to:\n\n*   Reestablish internet connectivity as soon as possible to record the payments to Stripe.\n*   Restrict transactions if they exceed a certain amount.\n*   [Fail all offline payments](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/features/operate-offline/collect-card-payments#managing-risk-while-offline) if the SDK has stored a set of transactions whose sum exceeds a certain amount.\n\nOffline payments follow the same steps as online payments: create, collect, process, and capture the payment. Your device can transition from online to offline at any step in the process.\n\n1.  [Enable offline mode](#enable-offline-mode)\n2.  [Connect to a reader while offline](#connect-while-offline)\n3.

To request access, please email [stripe-terminal-betas@stripe.com](mailto:stripe-terminal-betas@stripe.com). After we enable the changes for your account and you’ve enabled the feature using the Configuration API, you must disconnect and reconnect to your reader using the SDK for the updated configuration to take effect.\n\nTo use offline mode, your application needs to consume version `3.2.0` or later of the Terminal Android SDK.\n\nUse a [Configuration](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/configuration) object to enable offline mode for the [Stripe Reader S700](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/readers/stripe-reader-s700), [BBPOS WisePOS E](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/readers/bbpos-wisepos-e). devices at your `Location`.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/terminal/configurations \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d \"offline[enabled]\"=true`\n\nAfter you enable offline mode on a `Configuration` object, you can [assign it](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/fleet/configurations-overview?dashboard-or-api=api#create-a-configuration-for-an-individual-location) to a `Location`. You can also enable offline mode by default for all `Locations` by updating the [default](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/fleet/configurations-overview?dashboard-or-api=api#retrieve-the-account-default-configuration) `Configuration` object for your account. Configuration API changes can take several minutes to propagate to your SDK and reader, and require you to disconnect from and reconnect to your reader to take effect.\n\n[](#connect-while-offline)\n\nTo collect payments with a smart reader while offline, you must have previously connected to that reader at the same `Location` while online, on the same local network, within the last 30 days. The reader stores the `Location` information locally after connecting online, and it derives configuration information from that `Location` while operating offline.\n\nYour reader and POS device must be on the same local network used to connect online. You can’t switch networks while offline.\n\n[\n\n## Handle offline events![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n\n\n](#handle-offline-events)\n\nImplement the `OfflineListener` interface and pass it to Terminal to notify your application of offline-related events. You must set `OfflineListener` before collecting payments offline.\n\n``import com.stripe.stripeterminal.external.OfflineMode import com.stripe.stripeterminal.external.callable.OfflineListener import com.stripe.stripeterminal.external.models.*  @OptIn(OfflineMode::class) class CustomOfflineListener: OfflineListener {    override fun onOfflineStatusChange(offlineStatus: OfflineStatus)        // Check the value of `offlineStatus` and update your UI accordingly. For instance,        // you can check the SDK's network status at `offlineStatus.sdk.networkStatus`.        //        // You can also check the SDK's current offline status using        // `Terminal::offlineStatus`.    }     override fun onPaymentIntentForwarded(paymentIntent: PaymentIntent, e: TerminalException?) {        // The PaymentIntent was successfully forwarded, or an error occurred.        // Reconcile any local state using the backend-generated `PaymentIntent::id`        // and the metadata you supplied when creating the payment intent.        //        // Note that the `PaymentIntent::id` may still be null if creating the        // PaymentIntent in the backend failed.    }     override fun onForwardingFailure(e: TerminalException) {        // A non-specific error occurred while forwarding a PaymentIntent.        // Check the error message and your integration implementation to        // troubleshoot.    } }``\n\n`Terminal.initTerminal(    context = applicationContext,    logLevel = LogLevel.VERBOSE,    tokenProvider = TokenProvider(),    listener = TerminalEventListener(),    offlineListener = CustomOfflineListener(), ) // ...`\n\n[](#create-payment-intent)\n\nTo support operating offline, you must use the SDK’s `createPaymentIntent` to create PaymentIntent objects.\n\nWhile operating offline, `PaymentIntent` objects have a null `id`. We recommend adding a custom identifier to the PaymentIntent’s [metadata](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents#storing-information-in-metadata) to help reconcile `PaymentIntent` objects created offline. You can set up a [webhook](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks) endpoint to receive `PaymentIntent` events when offline payments are forwarded to Stripe, and use your identifier to associate them with a `PaymentIntent` ID.\n\n``import android.util.Log import androidx.fragment.app.Fragment import com.stripe.stripeterminal.Terminal import com.stripe.stripeterminal.external.OfflineMode import com.stripe.stripeterminal.external.callable.PaymentIntentCallback import com.stripe.stripeterminal.external.models.* import java.util.UUID  private const val TAG = \"ShoppingCartFragment\"  class ShoppingCartFragment : Fragment() {    // Action for a \"Checkout\" button    @OptIn(OfflineMode::class)    private fun onCheckout(cart: Cart) {        // Build up parameters for creating a `PaymentIntent`        val params = PaymentIntentParameters.Builder()            .setAmount(cart.total)            .setCurrency(cart.currency)            .setMetadata(mapOf(\"unique-id\" to UUID.randomUUID().toString()))            .build()         // Your app might want to prevent offline payments for too large an amount.        // Here, we require a network connection if the payment if the amount is over 1000 usd.        // Otherwise, we allow collecting offline if the network connection is unavailable.        val offlineBehavior = if (cart.total > 1000000) { OfflineBehavior.REQUIRE_ONLINE }          else { OfflineBehavior.PREFER_ONLINE }        val createConfig = CreateConfiguration(offlineBehavior)        val createPaymentCallback: PaymentIntentCallback = object : PaymentIntentCallback {            override fun onSuccess(paymentIntent: PaymentIntent) {                Log.d(TAG, \"createPaymentIntent succeeded\")                // If the `PaymentIntent` was created offline, its `id` field will be null.                if (paymentIntent.id != null) {                    Log.d(TAG, \"created online\")                } else {                     Log.d(TAG, \"created offline\")                }                // ... Collect a PaymentMethod            }             override fun onFailure(e: TerminalException) {                Log.e(TAG, \"createPaymentIntent failed\", e)                // Handle offline-specific errors in your application (for example,                // `offlineBehavior` was set to REQUIRE_ONLINE and the SDK is offline).            }        }        Terminal.getInstance().createPaymentIntent(params, createPaymentCallback, createConfig)    } }``\n\n#### Managing risk while offline![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe `Terminal.createPaymentIntent` accepts a `CreateConfiguration` parameter. By default, if you’re operating offline, the Terminal reader stores all offline payments, then forwards them to Stripe’s backend when connectivity is restored. You can pass a `CreateConfiguration` object with `offlineBehavior` set to `REQUIRE_ONLINE` to fail the current transaction if you’re operating offline. You might want to disallow transactions above a certain amount or disallow all offline transactions if the reader has stored a set of transactions whose sum exceeds a certain amount.\n\nThe SDK exposes two properties to help you manage risk:\n\n1.  `Terminal.offlineStatus.reader.offlinePaymentsCount`\n2.  `Terminal.offlineStatus.reader.offlinePaymentAmountsByCurrency`\n\n#### Managing latency while offline![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nBy default, the Terminal SDK automatically determines whether to collect payments online or offline based on your network connectivity. However, you might want to operate offline despite having an active network connection – for example, if you need to collect transactions quickly and your network connection is slow. You can pass a `CreateConfiguration` object with `offlineBehavior` set to `FORCE_OFFLINE` to collect the payment offline regardless of connectivity. Payments collected offline while the Terminal reader has an active network connection are forwarded in the background.\n\n[](#collect-payment-method)\n\nSwiping cards isn’t supported while offline. Tapping cards is also not supported in markets where [Strong Customer Authentication](https://docs.stripe.com/strong-customer-authentication \"Strong Customer Authentication\") is required. Your smart reader automatically displays the available payment options to the customer. Using the `updatePaymentIntent` parameter in `CollectConfiguration` is disabled when offline mode is enabled unless `offlineBehavior` is set to `REQUIRE_ONLINE`.\n\n#### Note\n\nPayment liability is your responsibility when operating your reader offline. Because magnetic stripe data is easy to spoof, Stripe disallows this option while operating offline.\n\n`import android.util.Log import androidx.fragment.app.Fragment import com.stripe.stripeterminal.Terminal import com.stripe.stripeterminal.external.OfflineMode import com.stripe.stripeterminal.external.callable.PaymentIntentCallback import com.stripe.stripeterminal.external.models.*  private const val TAG = \"ShoppingCartFragment\"  class ShoppingCartFragment : Fragment() {     // Action for a \"Checkout\" button     @OptIn(OfflineMode::class)     private fun onCheckout(cart: Cart) {         // SNIP: Create PaymentIntent         val collectPaymentCallback: PaymentIntentCallback = object : PaymentIntentCallback {             override fun onSuccess(paymentIntent: PaymentIntent) {                 Log.d(TAG, \"collectPaymentMethod succeeded\")                 // ... Confirm the payment             }              override fun onFailure(e: TerminalException) {                 // Handle offline-specific errors in your application (for example,                 // unsupported payment method).                 Log.d(TAG, \"collectPaymentMethod failed:\", e)             }         }         val collectConfig = CollectConfiguration.Builder().build()         Terminal.getInstance().collectPaymentMethod(paymentIntent, collectPaymentCallback, collectConfig)     } }`\n\n[](#confirm-payment)\n\nThis step is similar to [confirming payments while online](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/collect-card-payment?terminal-sdk-platform=android#confirm-payment). The primary difference is that your integration must handle offline-specific error cases, such as when the transaction exceeds the Stripe-enforced offline maximum of 10,000 USD or equivalent in your operating currency.\n\nIn some cases, the SDK might create a `PaymentIntent` online, but confirm it while offline. When this happens, the `PaymentIntent` might have a non-null `stripeId`. You can check `offlineDetails.storedAt` to determine if it was confirmed offline.\n\n``import android.util.Log import androidx.fragment.app.Fragment import com.stripe.stripeterminal.Terminal import com.stripe.stripeterminal.external.OfflineMode import com.stripe.stripeterminal.external.callable.PaymentIntentCallback import com.stripe.stripeterminal.external.models.*  private const val TAG = \"ShoppingCartFragment\"  class ShoppingCartFragment : Fragment() {     // Action for a \"Checkout\" button     @OptIn(OfflineMode::class)     private fun onCheckout(cart: Cart) {         // SNIP: Create PaymentIntent, and collect payment method.         val confirmPaymentIntentCallback: PaymentIntentCallback = object : PaymentIntentCallback {             override fun onSuccess(paymentIntent: PaymentIntent) {                 Log.d(TAG, \"confirmPaymentIntent succeeded\")                 // If the `PaymentIntent` was confirmed offline, `offlineDetails.storedAt` will be defined                 if (confirmResult.offlineDetails.storedAt != null) {                     Log.d(TAG, \"confirmed offline\");                 } else {                     Log.d(TAG, \"confirmed online\");                 }             }              override fun onFailure(e: TerminalException) {                 // Handle offline-specific errors in your application (for example,                 // unsupported payment method).                 Log.e(TAG, \"confirmPaymentIntent failed:\", e)             }         }         Terminal.getInstance().confirmPaymentIntent(paymentIntent, confirmPaymentIntentCallback)     } }``\n\n#### Providing receipts![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYou might require information about the card used to complete a payment while offline. For example, you might need to generate a receipt for customers who require one at the time of purchase.\n\nIf the PaymentIntent is confirmed offline, retrieve its [OfflineCardPresentDetails](https://stripe.dev/stripe-terminal-android/external/com.stripe.stripeterminal.external.models/-offline-card-present-details/index.html) from the `paymentIntent.offlineDetails.offlineCardPresentDetails` property.\n\nThis hash contains a [ReceiptDetails](https://stripe.dev/stripe-terminal-android/external/com.stripe.stripeterminal.external.models/-receipt-details/index.html) property you can use to generate a receipt, as well as other card details like the cardholder name and card brand.\n\nNot all receipt details are available while operating offline. [Prebuilt email receipts](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/features/receipts#prebuilt) are only sent after connectivity is restored and the payment is successfully captured.\n\n[](#wait-for-forward)\n\nWhen network connectivity is restored, the reader automatically begins forwarding the stored offline payments.\n\nIf you disconnect or power off your smart reader too soon, your payments might not be forwarded. You can query `Terminal.offlineStatus.reader.networkStatus` to make sure your reader is online and can forward payments, and `Terminal.offlineStatus.reader.offlinePaymentsCount` to check how many payments the Terminal reader has to be forwarded.\n\nIf your smart reader becomes damaged or otherwise can’t take payments, your stored payments can often still be forwarded. Make sure to connect the smart reader to your POS and re-establish Internet access to allow it to re-connect to Stripe.\n\n[](#capture-payment)\n\n#### Note\n\nWhile offline, you can create PaymentIntents with `captureMethod` set to `automatic`. Once you confirm these PaymentIntents, they have a `SUCCEEDED` status instead of `REQUIRES_CAPTURE` . Stripe automatically captures the payments after you forward them.\n\nPayments that are successfully forwarded and authorized require capture from your backend or application:\n\n*   To capture payments from your backend, use [webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks) to listen for PaymentIntents with a `requires_capture` status.\n*   To capture payments from your application, wait for your application to receive calls to `OfflineListener::onPaymentIntentForwarded` for each PaymentIntent as the reader forwards it. A PaymentIntent is ready to capture if its status is `REQUIRES_CAPTURE` .\n\nIf your application determines when to capture a PaymentIntent after `confirmPaymentIntent`, they’re ready to capture when the status is `REQUIRES_CAPTURE` , and the `offlineDetails` is null or has a `requiresUpload` of `false` .\n\nCapture a payment after `confirmPaymentIntent`, if it’s confirmed online:\n\n``import android.util.Log import androidx.fragment.app.Fragment import com.stripe.stripeterminal.Terminal import com.stripe.stripeterminal.external.OfflineMode import com.stripe.stripeterminal.external.callable.PaymentIntentCallback import com.stripe.stripeterminal.external.models.*  private const val TAG = \"ShoppingCartFragment\"  class ShoppingCartFragment : Fragment() {     // Action for a \"Checkout\" button     @OptIn(OfflineMode::class)     private fun onCheckout(cart: Cart) {         // SNIP: Create PaymentIntent, and collect payment method.         val callback: PaymentIntentCallback = object : PaymentIntentCallback {             override fun onSuccess(paymentIntent: PaymentIntent) {                 Log.d(TAG, \"confirmPaymentIntent succeeded\")                 if (paymentIntent.status == PaymentIntentStatus.REQUIRES_CAPTURE) {                     val offlineDetails = paymentIntent.offlineDetails                     if (offlineDetails?.requiresUpload == true) {                         // Offline payment, wait for `onPaymentIntentForwarded` (see snippet below)                     } else {                         // Online payment, can be captured now                     }                 } else {                     // handle other paymentIntent.status results here                 }             }              override fun onFailure(e: TerminalException) {                 // Handle offline-specific errors in your application (for example,                 // unsupported payment method).                 Log.e(TAG, \"confirmPaymentIntent failed:\", e)             }         }          Terminal.getInstance().confirmPaymentIntent(paymentIntent, callback)     } }``\n\nCapture an offline payment after the reader forwards it in your `OfflineListener::onPaymentIntentForwarded`:\n\n`import com.stripe.stripeterminal.external.OfflineMode import com.stripe.stripeterminal.external.callable.OfflineListener import com.stripe.stripeterminal.external.models.*  @OptIn(OfflineMode::class) class CustomOfflineListener : OfflineListener {    // ...    override fun onPaymentIntentForwarded(paymentIntent: PaymentIntent, e: TerminalException?) {        if (e != null) {            // Handle the error appropriate for your application        } else if (paymentIntent.status == PaymentIntentStatus.REQUIRES_CAPTURE) {            // The paymentIntent is ready to be captured        } else {            // Handle the paymentIntent.status as appropriate.        }    }    // ... }`",

We recommend that you configure your payment methods from the Stripe Dashboard using the instructions in [Accept a payment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=web&ui=stripe-hosted).\n\nIf you want to continue manually configuring the payment methods you present to your customers with Checkout, use this guide. Otherwise, update your integration to [configure payment methods in the Dashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/dashboard-payment-methods).\n\nAlipay is a [single-use](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#usage) payment method where customers are required to [authenticate](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#customer-actions) their payment. Customers pay by redirecting from your website or app, authorize the payment through Alipay, then return to your website or app where you get [immediate notification](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#payment-notification) on whether the payment succeeded or failed.\n\n[](#compatibility)\n\nTo support Alipay payments, a Checkout Session must satisfy all of the following conditions:\n\n*   [Prices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices \"Prices\") for all line items must be in the same currency.\n    *   If you have line items in different currencies, create separate Checkout Sessions for each currency.\n*   You can only use one-time line items.\n\nRecurring [subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/creating \"subscriptions\") plans aren’t supported.\n\n[](#accept-a-payment)\n\n#### Note\n\nBuild an integration to [accept a payment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment?integration=checkout) with Checkout before using this guide.\n\nThis guide describes how to enable Alipay and shows the differences between accepting a card payment and using Alipay.\n\n### Enable Alipay as a payment method![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nWhen creating a new [Checkout Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions), you need to:\n\n1.  Add `Alipay` to the list of `payment_method_types`.\n2.  Make sure all `line_items` use the same currency.\n\n`Stripe::Checkout::Session.create({   mode: 'payment',   payment_method_types: ['card'],   payment_method_types: ['card', 'alipay'],   line_items: [{     price_data: {       currency: 'usd',       product_data: {         name: 'T-shirt',       },       unit_amount: 2000,     },     quantity: 1,   }],   success_url: '[https://example.com/success](https://example.com/success)',   cancel_url: '[https://example.com/cancel](https://example.com/cancel)', })`\n\n### Fulfill your orders![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nAfter accepting a payment, learn how to [fulfill orders](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/fulfillment).\n\n[](#test-integration)\n\nWhen testing your Checkout integration, select Alipay as the payment method and click the **Pay** button.\n\n[\n\n## Handle refunds and disputes![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n\n\n](#refunds-and-disputes)\n\nThe refund period for Alipay is up to 90 days after the original payment.\n\nAlipay has no dispute process—customers authenticate with their Alipay account.",

Use both the Mobile Payment Element and the Customer Sheet to provide customers a consistent end-to-end solution for saved payment methods.\n\n![Screenshot of Customer Sheet presenting multiple saved payment methods in an iOS app.](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/ios-landing.6c4969968fd6efe3d39fe673628f8284.png)\n\nCustomerAdapter uses Customer Ephemeral Keys and serves as a bridge to help users of legacy products (such as the Basic Integration) adopt CustomerSheet more quickly. If you’re starting a new integration, we recommend adopting CustomerSession over Customer Ephemeral Keys.\n\n[](#ios-setup)\n\nFirst, you need a Stripe account. [Register now](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register).\n\nThe [Stripe iOS SDK](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-ios) is open source, [fully documented](https://stripe.dev/stripe-ios/index.html), and compatible with apps supporting iOS 13 or above.\n\nTo install the SDK, follow these steps:\n\n1.  In Xcode, select **File** > **Add Packages…** and enter `https://github.com/stripe/stripe-ios-spm` as the repository URL.\n2.  Select the latest version number from our [releases page](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-ios/releases).\n3.  Add the **StripePaymentSheet** product to the [target of your app](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift_packages/adding_package_dependencies_to_your_app).\n\nConfigure the SDK with your Stripe [publishable key](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys) on app start. This enables your app to make requests to the Stripe API.\n\n`import UIKit import StripePaymentSheet  @main class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {      func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {         StripeAPI.defaultPublishableKey =` \n\n`\"pk_test_TYooMQauvdEDq54NiTphI7jx\"`\n\n        `// do any other necessary launch configuration         return true     } }`\n\n#### Note\n\nUse your [test mode](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#obtain-api-keys) keys while you test and develop, and your [live mode](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#test-live-modes) keys when you publish your app.\n\n[](#ios-enable-payment-methods)\n\nView your [payment methods settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) and enable the payment methods you want to support. You need at least one payment method enabled to create a [SetupIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_intents \"Setup Intents API\").\n\nBy default, Stripe enables cards and other prevalent payment methods that can help you reach more customers, but we recommend turning on additional payment methods that are relevant for your business and customers. See [Payment method integration options](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/integration-options#payment-method-product-support) for product and payment method support, and our [pricing page](https://stripe.com/pricing/local-payment-methods) for fees.\n\n#### Note\n\nAt this time, CustomerSheet only supports cards and US bank accounts.\n\n[](#ios-add-endpoints)\n\nCreate two endpoints on your server: one for fetching a Customer’s ephemeral key, and one to create a [SetupIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_intents) for saving a new payment method to the [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers).\n\n1.  Create an endpoint to return a [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers) ID and an associated ephemeral key. You can view the API version used by the SDK [here](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-ios/blob/master/StripeCore/StripeCore/Source/API%20Bindings/STPAPIClient.swift#L233).\n\n`# Create a Customer (skip this and get the existing Customer ID if this is a returning customer) curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/customers \\   -u` \n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`: \\   -X \"POST\" curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/ephemeral_keys \\   -u sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc  : \\   -X \"POST\" \\   -d \"customer\"=\"{{CUSTOMER_ID}}\" \\`\n\n1.  Create an endpoint to return a [SetupIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_intents) configured with the [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers) ID.\n\n`# Create a Customer (skip this and get the existing Customer ID if this is a returning customer) curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/customers \\   -u` \n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`: \\   -X \"POST\" curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/setup_intents \\   -u sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc  : \\   -d \"customer\"=\"{{CUSTOMER_ID}}\" \\`\n\nIf you only plan to use the payment method for future payments when your customer is present during the checkout flow, set the [usage](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_intents/object#setup_intent_object-usage) parameter to on\\_session to improve authorization rates.\n\n[](#ios-customer-adapter)\n\nA `StripeCustomerAdapter` enables a `CustomerSheet` to communicate with Stripe. On the client, configure a `StripeCustomerAdapter` with providers that make requests to these endpoints on your server.\n\n`import StripePaymentSheet  let customerAdapter = StripeCustomerAdapter(customerEphemeralKeyProvider: {     let json = await myBackend.getCustomerEphemeralKey()     return CustomerEphemeralKey(customerId: json[\"customerId\"]!, ephemeralKeySecret: json[\"ephemeralKeySecret\"]!) }, setupIntentClientSecretProvider: {     let json = await myBackend.getSetupIntentForCustomer()     return json[\"setupIntentClientSecret\"]! })`\n\n[](#ios-configure-wallet-element)\n\nNext, configure the Customer Sheet with your `StripeCustomerAdapter` and a [`CustomerSheet.Configuration`](https://stripe.dev/stripe-ios/stripepaymentsheet/documentation/stripepaymentsheet/customersheet/configuration/).\n\n`var configuration = CustomerSheet.Configuration()  // Configure settings for the CustomerSheet here. For example: configuration.headerTextForSelectionScreen = \"Manage your payment method\"  let customerSheet = CustomerSheet(configuration: configuration, customer: customerAdapter)`\n\n[](#ios-present-wallet-element)\n\nPresent the Customer Sheet. When the customer dismisses the sheet, the Customer Sheet calls the completion block with a `CustomerSheet.SheetResult`.\n\n`import StripePaymentSheet  customerSheet.present(from: self, completion: { result in   switch result {   case .canceled(let paymentOption), .selected(let paymentOption):     // Configure your UI based on the payment option     self.paymentLabel.text = paymentOption?.displayData().label ?? \"None\"      // Optional: Send the selected payment method ID to your backend for advanced use cases     // like charging a customer when not present in your app     if let paymentOption = paymentOption {       switch paymentOption {       case .paymentMethod(let paymentMethod, let paymentOptionDisplayData):         MyBackend.setDefaultPaymentMethod(paymentMethod.stripeId)       case .applePay(paymentOptionDisplayData: let paymentOptionDisplayData):         MyBackend.setDefaultPaymentMethodIsApplePay()       }     }   case .error(let error):     // Show the error in your UI   } })`\n\n*   If the customer selects a payment method, the result is `.selected(PaymentOptionSelection?)`. The associated value is the selected [`PaymentOptionSelection`](https://stripe.dev/stripe-ios/stripepaymentsheet/documentation/stripepaymentsheet/customersheet/paymentoptionselection), or `nil` if the user deleted the previously-selected payment method. You can find the full payment method details in the PaymentOptionSelection’s `paymentMethod` associated value.\n*   If the user cancels the sheet, the result is `.canceled`. The associated value is the original payment method selected prior to opening the customer sheet, as long as that payment method is still available.\n*   If an error occurs, the result is `.error(Error)`.\n\nLearn more about how to [enable Apple Pay](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=ios&mobile-ui=payment-element#ios-apple-pay).",

  "markdown": "# India network tokenization | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Learn how the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) card on file tokenization guidelines affect you and how to use Stripe Managed Customer Consent collection.\n\nThe Reserve Bank of India (RBI) issued a [directive](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=11822&Mode=0) to the issuing banks and card networks for the non-storage of card credentials by Payment Aggregators, Payment Gateways, and Merchants in the India payments ecosystem. The RBI mandates card on file (CoF) tokenization through the card networks. This means:\n\n*   To store an India-issued customer card for future use for domestic India merchants, Stripe must tokenize the card with the card network (Visa/Mastercard).\n*   Customers must provide explicit consent to allow the tokenization and storage of the card on Stripe’s system.\n*   For users who don’t want to build their own custom checkout flow for collecting customer consent, Stripe provides a Stripe-managed customer consent flow by default.\n\nMerchants, Payment Aggregators (PAs), Payment Gateways (PGs), and acquiring banks can no longer store customer card information. Network tokenization and issuer tokenization is the only applicable way forward for the industry and the RBI.\n\n## Regulatory requirements![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYou must adhere to these requirements to implement tokenization:\n\n*   Scope a Token to a Merchant, Customer Card, and Token Requestor.\n*   Take explicit user consent and Additional Factor of Authentication before generating a Token.\n*   As the Merchant, you’re required to give the customer an option to de-register their Token from the Merchant platform.\n*   During transactions, make available to a Merchant only the last 4 digits of the customer card, Issuer Bank name, and card network (visible on the Stripe Dashboard for payments).\n\n#### Note\n\nThis applies only to India domestic merchants for domestic transactions. International merchants on Stripe aren’t contracted with Stripe India or bound by these requirements. Cards won’t be automatically tokenized.\n\n## Tokenize customer cards![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nTokenization minimally impacts the end customer. To convert their cards into a token, a customer must give you consent during payment for a transaction. This applies to new and saved card consent flows.\n\nYou can use Stripe Managed Customer Consent to collect customer consent on your behalf. Stripe will automatically prompt the customer for consent before proceeding to 3D Secure authentication.\n\nIf you want to create a custom consent flow, you can opt out of Stripe Managed Customer Consent. To do so, navigate to [Card Storage Consent](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/card_storage_consent) under Compliance in the Dashboard.\n\nIf you opt out, you must collect customer consent and only save card details for future use on the `Customer` object if the cardholder gives consent in your checkout consent flow.\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/customer-consent-modal.f76e495163cda39ce68fc98fb900b99c.png)\n\nStripe Managed Consent Collection Experience\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/dashboard-toggle.519b55eff7a68a73d02a4ec549343209.png)\n\nOpting out of Stripe Managed Consent Collection\n\nCustomers who have tokenized their cards will see only the last 4 digits of their saved cards.\n\n## Collect card information for customers that opt out of tokenization![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nCustomers who choose not to tokenize their cards must enter their 16 digit card number, expiry, and CVC for all card transactions.\n\nIf you have a direct API integration and don’t currently collect CVC in your checkout flow, you must add it to your integration to continue accepting payments. When you’re collecting payment method details, populate the [CVC field](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods/create#create_payment_method-card-cvc).\n\n## More information![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nFor more details on the updated requirements to have a compliant integration with Stripe, see [Saving cards in India](https://support.stripe.com/questions/guide-for-saving-cards-in-india).\n\nContact us at [support.stripe.com](https://support.stripe.com/) if you have any questions or need help with understanding how to comply with the regulations.",

The following table describes other important fields to consider when importing subscriptions.\n\n| Field | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| [customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscription_schedules/object#subscription_schedule_object-customer) | Make sure that you’ve properly mapped the customer ID from your source data to the new customer ID in Stripe. |\n| [phases.items.price](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscription_schedules/object#subscription_schedule_object-phases-items-price) | Make sure that you’ve mapped the price ID from your source data to the new price ID in Stripe. |\n| [current\\_phase.start\\_date](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscription_schedules/object#subscription_schedule_object-current_phase-start_date) | Make sure that the subscription schedule you define in Stripe lines up with and maintains continuity from your original source data. For example, if a customer has 6 months left on a yearly subscription in your source system, make sure that `billing_cycle_anchor` and `start_date` reflect the correct mid-cycle term. |\n| Third-party metadata | Import any additional data fields from your source data, which might include product names, plan names, and third-party application IDs. |\n| Tax settings | Include any tax IDs, VAT IDs, or other tax information. |\n\n#### Prepare legacy prices![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nIf you created placeholders for [legacy prices](#legacy-prices), you need to map those prices to the subscriptions and customers you’re importing. For each subscription with a legacy price, use the [price\\_data](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/create#create_subscription-items-price_data) parameter of the [Subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions#subscriptions) API to pass in information about the price and subscription. The required fields are:\n\n| Parameter | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| [currency](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/create#create_subscription-items-price_data-currency) | Currency of the price, in three-letter ISO format. |\n| [product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/create#create_subscription-items-price_data-product) | ID of the placeholder product. You can use this for all of the legacy prices. |\n| [recurring](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/create#create_subscription-items-price_data-recurring) | Information about the amount and frequency of the recurring price. |\n| [recurring.interval](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/create#create_subscription-items-price_data-recurring) | Frequency of the interval-`day`, `week`, `month`, or `year`. |\n| [recurring.interval\\_count](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/create#create_subscription-items-price_data-recurring-interval_count) | Number of intervals between billings. For example, setting `interval=day` and `interval_count=30` means that you bill the customer every 30 days. The maximum interval is 1 year (1 year, 12 months, or 52 weeks). |\n| [recurring.unit\\_amount\\_decimal](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/create#create_subscription-items-price_data-unit_amount_decimal) | Same as [unit\\_amount](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/create#create_subscription-items-price_data-unit_amount), but allows you to specify more granular decimal amounts in cents, up to 12 decimals. You can only set one of `unit_amount` and `unit_amount_decimal`. |\n\n### Import subscription data into Stripe![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nAfter you’ve prepared your source data, you can start importing subscriptions into Stripe.\n\n#### Test mode ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nUse [test mode](https://docs.stripe.com/test-mode \"test mode\") to run through the pricing model import process at least once before running the import in live mode. You need to remap your script:\n\n*   If you wipe the data in test mode and rerun the import.\n*   When you move to live mode, because the price IDs are different in test mode and live mode.\n\nIn test mode, you can use [test clocks](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/testing/test-clocks) to simulate subscriptions advancing through time. This allows you to see how the migrated subscriptions work in production.\n\n#### Create subscriptions![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nWhile you can use the [Subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions) API to create subscriptions, we recommend using the [Subscription Schedules](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscription_schedules) API. With this API, you can schedule subscriptions to start in the future. For example, it’s the only way to start monthly subscriptions more than 30 days in advance. The ability to start subscriptions in the future also allows you to review the import before you start to bill your customers in production.\n\nAdditionally, the Subscription Schedules API provides `phases`, which provide much more flexibility in defining settings such as tax behavior, collection method, and coupon usage within more granular intervals. You can also define different behavior for different intervals. For example, you could apply a coupon only for the first 3 months of a yearly subscription.\n\nHere’s how to create subscriptions that start on June 1, 2022 at 12:00 AM UTC.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/subscription_schedules \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d customer=  {{CUSTOMER_ID}}   \\  -d \"default_settings[billing_cycle_anchor]\"=phase_start \\  -d \"phases[0][items][0][price]\"=  {{PRICE_ID}}   \\  -d start_date=1654066801`",
