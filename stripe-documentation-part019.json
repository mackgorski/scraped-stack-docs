    "markdown": "# How UI extensions work | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Learn the UI extensions system and its parts, and get a high-level understanding of how you can extend the Stripe Dashboard.\n\nStripe Apps UI extensions let you render your own UI into Stripe’s products using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/). These tools should be familiar if you’ve developed in React. But because they run within a secure sandbox embedded on another web page, they differ from standard browser-based React applications in several ways.\n\n## Overview![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nUI extensions are written in TypeScript and use React to create UI using [Stripe’s UI toolkit](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/components). Unlike other React environments, UI extensions don’t support arbitrary HTML. Instead, they exclusively use UI components provided by Stripe. The structure of a UI extension involves some key directories and files:\n\n*   `stripe-app.json`: The [app manifest](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/reference/app-manifest \"app manifest\"). It describes how apps interact with Stripe, including what permissions they need, whether they have a UI extension, and—if so—where that extension appears in Stripe’s UI.\n*   `package.json`: NPM package metadata. The UI extensions are regular [NPM packages](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-packages-and-modules). You can manage dependencies using [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).\n*   `src`: The actual TypeScript source code for the UI extension. By default, the CLI places a generic view in `src/views` with a corresponding entry in `stripe-app.json`.\n\nDeveloping a UI extension relies on the Stripe CLI app plugin. The CLI takes care of initializing apps with the correct structure, configuring the app manifest, running a development server, and bundling the app appropriately for submission to Stripe.\n\n### Developing a UI extension![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n*   As the app developer, you write views, which are React components registered to appear whenever a specific [viewport](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/reference/viewports) appears on the screen. For example, to make a view appear whenever a user is viewing an invoice details page, register it to the viewport `stripe.dashboard.invoice.detail`.\n*   When you’re ready to upload your app, CLI commands help you bundle up your code, upload it to Stripe, and host your app on Stripe’s CDN.\n*   When your app’s UI extension gets initialized, Stripe downloads the app’s code into a sandboxed iframe.\n*   When a user goes to a page that has a particular viewport (for example, `/invoices/inv_1283`):\n    *   Stripe defines the UI extension’s view inside the sandbox with the context provided by the viewport.\n    *   Stripe passes the view to the Dashboard to be displayed to users.\n    *   When users interact with the UI extension (for example, by clicking a button), event handlers in the UI extension sandbox receive the event and can update the view.\n\n![System diagram of Stripe App UI extension](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/extensions-structure.d6d4d0512ef2194eda5c7ffd214e894e.jpg)\n\n## Views and viewports![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nTo display UI to users of an app, create a React view and register it with a viewport.\n\nViews are React components that the app exports. Viewports are identifiers that indicate where the view displays. When you upload an app, all views exported by the app register with the associated viewport.\n\nViews automatically register with viewports when you run `stripe apps add view`. Behind the scenes, this adds an entry to the [app manifest](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/reference/app-manifest \"app manifest\").\n\n`{   //... other manifest properties   \"ui_extension\": {     \"views\": [       {           \"viewport\": \"stripe.dashboard.invoice.detail\", // See all valid values at stripe.com/docs/stripe-apps/reference/viewports           \"component\": \"NameOfComponent\" // This is provided by you       }       // ... additional views     ]   } }`\n\n## Lifecycle of a UI extension![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nUI extensions run in an invisible, sandboxed iframe that asynchronously sends UI updates to the Stripe Dashboard, which then displays the UI updates. A single sandbox can accommodate multiple views at the same time.\n\nThe lifecycle of the sandbox and the views it powers works like this:\n\n*   The Dashboard loads the UI extension sandbox, which happens between when the Dashboard loads and when the user opens the app.\n*   When a view needs to be displayed, the Dashboard waits for the sandbox to be initialized, and then directs the sandbox to mount the correct view and passes in the [appropriate context](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/reference/extensions-sdk-api#props).\n*   When the user dismisses the view (for example, when they close the app drawer), the view unmounts. Unmounting the view removes it from the DOM and from the sandboxed React tree.\n*   The sandbox might stay running or shut down depending on resource usage. The only guarantee is that the Dashboard makes a best-effort attempt to allow [useEffect](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html) and other cleanup handlers to run before terminating the sandbox.\n\n![Lifecyle of a Stripe Apps UI extension](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/extensions-lifecycle.0fef55cf88daa063de38151596ad17e5.jpg)\n\nLifecyle of a Stripe Apps UI extension\n\n## Sandbox limitations![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nBecause of the unique sandbox environment where UI extension code runs, a Stripe Apps UI extension can’t do everything that a regular React app running in a full browser context can do.\n\n### Main differences between Stripe Apps and regular React apps![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n1.  Stripe Apps don’t have direct access to the DOM. They run in an iframe with a separate DOM that’s invisible from the Dashboard.\n2.  The Dashboard proxies and serializes all data to the app. UI toolkit components only accept serializable data.\n3.  The Dashboard also proxies and serializes all _props_ to the app, so functions passed to or triggered by UI toolkit components are asynchronous.\n\n### React and JavaScript limitations![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe restrictions below affect what you can do with React and JavaScript when developing your app. The React tree doesn’t render to the DOM until the Stripe Dashboard host environment deserializes and evaluates it. The DOM for the app updates, and the instance of React in the Dashboard manages data input.\n\n#### Global document and window objects are limited![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe DOM environment that the UI extension code is running in is locked down by the [sandboxed iframe](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe#attr-sandbox). This means that top-level APIs like [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage), [indexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/web/api/indexeddb), and [BroadcastChannel](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/web/api/broadcastchannel) are unavailable. Any DOM API that relies on the [same-origin policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy) doesn’t work as expected because sandboxed iframes have a `null` origin.\n\n#### React ref props are unsupported![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nUI components don’t support React `ref` props because the React tree is serialized and passed to the Stripe Dashboard to be rendered. The DOM that the components are eventually rendered into is inaccessible from the sandboxed App code.\n\n#### Apps can’t control the React version![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe default `package.json` file generated with each Stripe app has a `dependency` entry for `react`, but changing this version has no effect on the version of React that renders your app. The Stripe Dashboard uses its version of React (currently version 17) to render all apps. The `react` dependency in the local `package.json` only performs type checking and unit testing and you shouldn’t change it (unless instructed by Stripe) to ensure compatibility.\n\n#### Use uncontrolled components for interactions![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe Dashboard serializes and proxies all data input to the app, which results in input lag while using React [controlled components](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html#controlled-components). This lag is perceptible by the user and can potentially overwrite characters that they typed in the meantime. It also results in the cursor skipping to the end of a text input if they try to edit text at the beginning.\n\nTo reduce lag in your app, use user inputs in an uncontrolled manner:\n\n`import {useState} from 'react'; import {TextArea} from '@stripe/ui-extension-sdk/ui';  const App = () => {   const defaultValue = 'Initial TextArea value';   const [text, setText] = useState(defaultValue);   return (     <>       <TextArea         label=\"Message\"         // This doesn't work ❌         // Attempting to edit text at the beginning skips the cursor to the end         value={text}         onChange={e => setText(e.target.value)}       />       <TextArea         label=\"Message\"         // This will work ✅         defaultValue={defaultValue}         onChange={e => setText(e.target.value)}       />     </>   ); };`\n\n### UI component restrictions![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe restrictions below apply to [UI components](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/components). While your extension runs in an isolated environment, UI components render directly in the Dashboard. The SDK informs the Dashboard to render UI toolkit components, which results in the following limitations.\n\n#### Components can’t stop event propagation![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nBecause event handlers are called asynchronously, the event has already propagated by the time the app’s event handler is called. As a result, the app can’t stop event propagation or bubbling.\n\n#### Components only accept serializable data types as props![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nUI components only accept serializable data types. Passing unserializable data types like `Map` or `Set` as a prop to a UI Toolkit component throws an error.\n\nUse only simple types, functions, or React events as props. Supported types are:\n\n*   Strings, numbers, `true`, `false`, `null`, and `undefined`\n*   Objects whose keys and values are all simple types\n*   Arrays whose values are all simple types\n*   Functions, but they become asynchronous when proxied. Any functions passed as arguments or returned are also subject to the type limitations\n*   React events\n\n#### Components don’t support render functions![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nReact renders synchronously, but functions passed to UI components become asynchronous after the Dashboard proxies them to the app. Functions that generate markup passed to a UI component don’t finish rendering in time for React to use their results. As a result, no UI components accept render functions.\n\nThis means that the following patterns don’t work:\n\n`// This doesn't work ❌ <ItemProvider>   {(data) => (     <Item data={data} />   )} </ItemProvider>`\n\n`// This doesn't work ❌ <Item renderFooter={() => <div>footer</div>} />`\n\n#### JSX can only be passed to non-children props as a single node![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nUI components support props that take a single React element:\n\n`// This will work ✅ <Item footer={<div>footer</div>} />`\n\nMore complex JSX data structures are unsupported, however:\n\n`// This doesn't work ❌ <Item footer={[<div>one</div>, <div>two</div>]} />`\n\n`// This doesn't work ❌ <Item footer={{   one: <div>one</div>,   two: <div>two</div> }} />`\n\nIf you need to pass multiple React elements to a UI component, wrap them in a fragment:\n\n`// This works ✅ <Item footer={   <>     <div>one</div>     <div>two</div>   </> }/>`\n\nA similar constraint applies to `children`. Arrays and objects containing JSX are unsupported, but multiple React elements are allowed:\n\n`// This works ✅ <Item>   <div>one</div>   <div>two</div> </Item>`\n\n## Installing NPM Packages![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThere aren’t any restrictions on adding third-party NPM packages to Stripe Apps; feel free to install packages as you see fit. However, not all packages work as expected given the [sandbox limitations](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/how-ui-extensions-work#sandbox-limitations) of UI extensions.\n\nUsing a utility library like `lodash` is fine, because `lodash` doesn’t require DOM access:\n\n`import { Box, Button } from \"@stripe/ui-extension-sdk/ui\"; import { useState } from \"react\"; import kebabCase from \"lodash/kebabCase\";  const text = \"A note to the user\";  const App = () => {   const [isKebabCase, setIsKebabCase] = useState(false);   return (     <>       {/* This will work ✅ */}       <Box>{isKebabCase ? kebabCase(text) : text}</Box>       <Button         onPress={() => {           setIsKebabCase(!isKebabCase);         }}       >         Toggle kebab-case       </Button>     </>   ); };`\n\nUsing a form library like `react-hook-form` won’t work because `react-hook-form` uses Refs to manage form state:\n\n`import { TextField } from \"@stripe/ui-extension-sdk/ui\"; import { useForm } from \"react-hook-form\";  const App = () => {   const { register } = useForm();   const { onChange, name, ref } = register(\"firstName\");   return (     <TextField       label=\"First name\"       placeholder=\"Enter your name\"       name={name}       onChange={onChange}       // This doesn't work ❌       ref={ref}     />   ); };`",

They can have one of five sizes:\n\n*   `xsmall`: `12px`\n*   `small`: `16px`\n*   `medium`: `20px` (default)\n*   `large`: `32px`\n*   `xlarge`: `64px`\n\n`<Icon name=\"konbini\" size=\"xsmall\" /> <Icon name=\"konbini\" size=\"small\" /> <Icon name=\"konbini\" size=\"medium\" /> <Icon name=\"konbini\" size=\"large\" /> <Icon name=\"konbini\" size=\"xlarge\" />`\n\n## Color and fill![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYou can give the `Icon` component color with the `fill` property of the `css` prop.\n\n`<Icon name=\"cancelCircle\" css={{fill: 'critical'}} />`\n\n### Default color behavior![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nBy default, icons are the same color as the text around them.\n\n`<Inline css={{color: 'attention'}}>   <Icon name=\"mobile\" /> new messages </Inline>`\n\n## Accessibility![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nBy default, there is an `aria-hidden` attribute on icons ([read more about ARIA](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA)). In the rare situations the icon has semantic value to screen-reader users, you can manually set `aria-hidden={false}`. In these situations it’s often a good idea to add an `aria-label` as well. In general, it’s better to have text labels rather than making visual-only icons important for a workflow.\n\n`<Icon icon={addCircle} aria-hidden={false} aria-label=\"Add another item\" />`\n\n## Icons in Button and Badge components![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYou can place an `Icon` component inside of a `Button` or `Badge` component.\n\n`<Button>   <Icon name=\"mobile\" size=\"xsmall\" />   <Inline>New messages</Inline> </Button> <Badge type=\"positive\">   <Icon name=\"mobile\" size=\"xsmall\" />   New messages </Badge>`\n\n## Icon reference![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)",

If you’re starting a new integration, we recommend adopting CustomerSession over Customer Ephemeral Keys.\n\n[](#ios-setup)\n\nFirst, you need a Stripe account. [Register now](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register).\n\nThe [Stripe iOS SDK](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-ios) is open source, [fully documented](https://stripe.dev/stripe-ios/index.html), and compatible with apps supporting iOS 13 or above.\n\nTo install the SDK, follow these steps:\n\n1.  In Xcode, select **File** > **Add Packages…** and enter `https://github.com/stripe/stripe-ios-spm` as the repository URL.\n2.  Select the latest version number from our [releases page](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-ios/releases).\n3.  Add the **StripePaymentSheet** product to the [target of your app](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift_packages/adding_package_dependencies_to_your_app).\n\nConfigure the SDK with your Stripe [publishable key](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys) on app start. This enables your app to make requests to the Stripe API.\n\n`import UIKit import StripePaymentSheet  @main class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {      func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {         StripeAPI.defaultPublishableKey =` \n\n`\"pk_test_TYooMQauvdEDq54NiTphI7jx\"`\n\n        `// do any other necessary launch configuration         return true     } }`\n\n#### Note\n\nUse your [test mode](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#obtain-api-keys) keys while you test and develop, and your [live mode](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#test-live-modes) keys when you publish your app.\n\n[](#ios-enable-payment-methods)\n\nView your [payment methods settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) and enable the payment methods you want to support. You need at least one payment method enabled to create a [SetupIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_intents \"Setup Intents API\").\n\nBy default, Stripe enables cards and other prevalent payment methods that can help you reach more customers, but we recommend turning on additional payment methods that are relevant for your business and customers. See [Payment method integration options](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/integration-options#payment-method-product-support) for product and payment method support, and our [pricing page](https://stripe.com/pricing/local-payment-methods) for fees.\n\n#### Note\n\nAt this time, CustomerSheet only supports cards and US bank accounts.\n\n[](#ios-add-endpoints)\n\nCreate two endpoints on your server: one for fetching a Customer’s ephemeral key, and one to create a [SetupIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_intents) for saving a new payment method to the [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers).\n\n1.  Create an endpoint to return a [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers) ID and an associated ephemeral key. You can view the API version used by the SDK [here](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-ios/blob/master/StripeCore/StripeCore/Source/API%20Bindings/STPAPIClient.swift#L233).\n\n`# Create a Customer (skip this and get the existing Customer ID if this is a returning customer) curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/customers \\   -u` \n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`: \\   -X \"POST\" curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/ephemeral_keys \\   -u sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc  : \\   -X \"POST\" \\   -d \"customer\"=\"{{CUSTOMER_ID}}\" \\`\n\n1.

On the client, configure a `StripeCustomerAdapter` with providers that make requests to these endpoints on your server.\n\n`import StripePaymentSheet  let customerAdapter = StripeCustomerAdapter(customerEphemeralKeyProvider: {     let json = await myBackend.getCustomerEphemeralKey()     return CustomerEphemeralKey(customerId: json[\"customerId\"]!, ephemeralKeySecret: json[\"ephemeralKeySecret\"]!) }, setupIntentClientSecretProvider: {     let json = await myBackend.getSetupIntentForCustomer()     return json[\"setupIntentClientSecret\"]! })`\n\n[](#ios-configure-wallet-element)\n\nNext, configure the Customer Sheet with your `StripeCustomerAdapter` and a [`CustomerSheet.Configuration`](https://stripe.dev/stripe-ios/stripepaymentsheet/documentation/stripepaymentsheet/customersheet/configuration/).\n\n`var configuration = CustomerSheet.Configuration()  // Configure settings for the CustomerSheet here. For example: configuration.headerTextForSelectionScreen = \"Manage your payment method\"  let customerSheet = CustomerSheet(configuration: configuration, customer: customerAdapter)`\n\n[](#ios-present-wallet-element)\n\nPresent the Customer Sheet. When the customer dismisses the sheet, the Customer Sheet calls the completion block with a `CustomerSheet.SheetResult`.\n\n`import StripePaymentSheet  customerSheet.present(from: self, completion: { result in   switch result {   case .canceled(let paymentOption), .selected(let paymentOption):     // Configure your UI based on the payment option     self.paymentLabel.text = paymentOption?.displayData().label ?? \"None\"      // Optional: Send the selected payment method ID to your backend for advanced use cases     // like charging a customer when not present in your app     if let paymentOption = paymentOption {       switch paymentOption {       case .paymentMethod(let paymentMethod, let paymentOptionDisplayData):         MyBackend.setDefaultPaymentMethod(paymentMethod.stripeId)       case .applePay(paymentOptionDisplayData: let paymentOptionDisplayData):         MyBackend.setDefaultPaymentMethodIsApplePay()       }     }   case .error(let error):     // Show the error in your UI   } })`\n\n*   If the customer selects a payment method, the result is `.selected(PaymentOptionSelection?)`. The associated value is the selected [`PaymentOptionSelection`](https://stripe.dev/stripe-ios/stripepaymentsheet/documentation/stripepaymentsheet/customersheet/paymentoptionselection), or `nil` if the user deleted the previously-selected payment method. You can find the full payment method details in the PaymentOptionSelection’s `paymentMethod` associated value.\n*   If the user cancels the sheet, the result is `.canceled`. The associated value is the original payment method selected prior to opening the customer sheet, as long as that payment method is still available.\n*   If an error occurs, the result is `.error(Error)`.\n\nLearn more about how to [enable Apple Pay](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=ios&mobile-ui=payment-element#ios-apple-pay).",

    "markdown": "# Elements Appearance API | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\nThe [mobile Payment Element](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=react-native&mobile-ui=payment-element) supports visual customization, which allows you to match the design of your app. The layout stays consistent, but you can modify colors, fonts, and more by using the [`appearance`](http://todo.com/) parameter when you call [`initPaymentSheet()`](https://stripe.dev/stripe-react-native/api-reference/index.html#initPaymentSheet).\n\n1.  Start by customizing the [font](#fonts-react-native)\n2.  Customize [colors](#colors-react-native) to match your app\n3.  Customize [shapes](#shapes-react-native) like the border radius\n4.  Fine-tune [specific components](#specific-ui-components-react-native)\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/ios-appearance-before-after-example.ad6a9aad238be9b198e9ebbc77ebe1d4.png)\n\n`// The following code creates the appearance shown in the screenshot above const customAppearance = {  font: {    family:      Platform.OS === 'android' ?

On iOS, the value of `family` should be the “PostScript name” found in Font Book. On Android, copy the `.ttf` or `.otf` file from `android/app/src/main/assets/font/<your-font>` to `android/app/src/main/res/font/<your-font>` and use the name of the font file (containing only lowercase, alphanumeric characters). The mobile Payment Element uses the font family of your custom font, but determines sizes and weights itself.\n\nTo increase or decrease the size of text, set `scale`. We multiply font sizes by this value before displaying them. This is useful if your custom font is slightly larger or smaller than the system font.\n\n`const { error } = await initPaymentSheet({  ...  appearance: {    font: {      family: Platform.OS === 'android' ? 'avenirnextregular' : 'AvenirNext-Regular',      scale: 1.15,    },  }, });`\n\n[](#colors-react-native)\n\nCustomize the colors in the mobile Payment Element by modifying the color categories defined in [`GlobalColorConfig`](https://stripe.dev/stripe-react-native/api-reference/modules/PaymentSheet.html#GlobalColorConfig). Each color category determines the color of one or more components in the UI. For example, `primary` defines the color of the **Pay** button and selected items like the **Save this card** checkbox. Refer to the diagram below to see some of the UI elements associated with each color category.\n\n#### Note\n\nTo support dark mode, pass maps for both `light` and `dark` colors to [`colors`](https://stripe.dev/stripe-react-native/api-reference/modules/PaymentSheet.html#AppearanceParams).\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/react-native-appearance-colors.2e9b577269f6771c61c7a6e068eb8980.png)\n\n[](#specific-ui-components-react-native)\n\nThe sections above describe customization options that affect the mobile Payment Element broadly, across multiple UI components. We also provide customization options specifically for the primary button (for example, the **Pay** button). Refer to the [`PrimaryButtonConfig`](https://stripe.dev/stripe-react-native/api-reference/modules/PaymentSheet.html#PrimaryButtonConfig) for the full list of customization options.\n\nCustomization options for specific UI components take precedence over other values. For example, `primaryButton.shapes.borderRadius` overrides the value of `shapes.borderRadius`.\n\n#### Note\n\n[Let us know](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-react-native/issues/new/choose) if you think we need to add more customization options.",

    "markdown": "# Apple Pay | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Allow customers to securely make payments using Apple Pay on their iPhone, iPad, or Apple Watch.\n\nApple Pay is compatible with most Stripe products and features. Stripe users can accept [Apple Pay](https://stripe.com/apple-pay) in iOS applications in iOS 9 and above, and on the web in Safari starting with iOS 10 or macOS Sierra. There are no additional fees to process Apple Pay payments, and [pricing](https://stripe.com/pricing) is the same as for other card transactions.\n\nApple Pay is available to cardholders at participating banks in supported countries. For more information, refer to Apple’s [participating banks](https://support.apple.com/en-us/ht204916) documentation.\n\n![Apple pay payment flow animation showing the Stripe checkout page, the Apple Pay button, and the confirmation dialog in test mode.](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/apple-pay.3447ce2deeaab40d6d231eed4dc34644.gif)\n\n## Using Stripe and Apple Pay versus in-app purchases![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nFor sales of physical goods, services, and certain other things, your app can accept Apple Pay or any other Stripe-supported payment method. Those payments are processed through Stripe, and you only need to pay Stripe’s [processing fees](https://stripe.com/pricing). However, sales of digital products, content, and certain other things must use Apple’s [in-app purchases](https://developer.apple.com/in-app-purchase). Those payments are processed by Apple and are subject to their transaction fees.\n\nFor more information about which sales must use in-app purchases, see the Apple [App Store Review Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#payments).\n\n## Accept Apple Pay ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nStripe offers a variety of methods to add Apple Pay as a payment method. For integration details, select the method you prefer:\n\nYou can use the Stripe [React Native SDK](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-react-native), to accept both Apple Pay and traditional credit card payments. Before starting, you need to enroll in the [Apple Developer Program](https://developer.apple.com/programs/) and [set up Stripe on your server and in your app](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=react-native&mobile-ui=payment-element#react-native-setup). Next, follow these steps:\n\n1.  [Register for an Apple Merchant ID](#merchantid)\n2.  [Create a new Apple Pay certificate](#csr)\n3.  [Integrate with Xcode](#xcode-pay)\n4.  [Set your Apple Merchant ID in StripeProvider](#set-merchantid)\n5.  [Check if Apple Pay is supported](#check-if-apple-pay-supported)\n6.  [Present the payment sheet](#present-payment-sheet)\n7.  [Submit the payment to Stripe](#handle-payment)\n\n[](#merchantid)\n\nObtain an Apple Merchant ID by [registering for a new identifier](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/add/merchant) on the Apple Developer website.\n\nFill out the form with a description and identifier. Your description is for your own records and you can modify it in the future. Stripe recommends using the name of your app as the identifier (for example, `merchant.com.{{YOUR_APP_NAME}}`).\n\n[](#csr)\n\nCreate a certificate for your app to encrypt payment data.\n\nGo to the [iOS Certificate Settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/ios_certificates) in the Dashboard, click **Add new application**, and follow the guide.\n\nDownload a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) file to get a secure certificate from Apple that allows you to use Apple Pay.\n\nOne CSR file must be used to issue exactly one certificate. If you switch your Apple Merchant ID, you must go to the [iOS Certificate Settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/ios_certificates) in the Dashboard to obtain a new CSR and certificate.\n\n[](#xcode-pay)\n\nAdd the Apple Pay capability to your app. In Xcode, open your project settings, click the **Signing & Capabilities** tab, and add the **Apple Pay** capability. You might be prompted to log in to your developer account at this point. Select the merchant ID you created earlier, and your app is ready to accept Apple Pay.\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/xcode.a701d4c1922d19985e9c614a6f105bf1.png)\n\nEnable the Apple Pay capability in Xcode\n\n[](#set-merchantid)\n\nIn the `StripeProvider` component, specify the Apple Merchant ID that you successfully registered for:\n\n`import { StripeProvider } from '@stripe/stripe-react-native';  function App() {   return (     <StripeProvider       publishableKey=\"`\n\n`pk_test_TYooMQauvdEDq54NiTphI7jx`\n\n`\"       merchantIdentifier=\"merchant.com.{{YOUR_APP_NAME}}\"     >       // Your app code here     </StripeProvider>   ); }`\n\n[](#check-if-apple-pay-supported)\n\nBefore displaying Apple Pay as a payment option in your app, determine if the user’s device supports Apple Pay and that they have a card added to their wallet:\n\n`import { PlatformPayButton, isPlatformPaySupported } from '@stripe/stripe-react-native';  function PaymentScreen() {   const [isApplePaySupported, setIsApplePaySupported] = useState(false);    useEffect(() => {     (async function () {       setIsApplePaySupported(await isPlatformPaySupported());     })();   }, [isPlatformPaySupported]);    // ...    const pay = async () => {     // ...   };    // ...    return (     <View>       {isApplePaySupported && (         <PlatformPayButton           onPress={pay}           type={PlatformPay.ButtonType.Order}           appearance={PlatformPay.ButtonStyle.Black}           borderRadius={4}           style={{             width: '100%',             height: 50,           }}         />       )}     </View>   ); }`\n\n[\n\n## Create the Payment Intent![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n\n\n](#handle-payment)\n\n### Server-side ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nMake an endpoint that creates a PaymentIntent with an [amount](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-amount) and [currency](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-currency). Always decide how much to charge on the server side, a trusted environment, as opposed to the client side. This prevents malicious customers from choosing their own prices.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/payment_intents \\   -u` \n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`: \\   -d \"amount\"=1099 \\   -d \"currency\"=\"usd\"`\n\n### Client-side![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nCreate a method that requests a PaymentIntent from your server:\n\n``function PaymentScreen() {   // ...   const fetchPaymentIntentClientSecret = async () => {     const response = await fetch(`${API_URL}/create-payment-intent`, {       method: 'POST',       headers: {         'Content-Type': 'application/json',       },       body: JSON.stringify({         some: 'value',       }),     });     const { clientSecret } = await response.json();      return clientSecret;   };   // ... }``\n\n### Troubleshooting ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nIf you’re seeing errors from the Stripe API when attempting to create tokens, you most likely have a problem with your Apple Pay Certificate. You’ll need to generate a new certificate and upload it to Stripe, as described on this page. Make sure you use a CSR obtained from your Dashboard and not one you generated yourself. Xcode often incorrectly caches old certificates, so in addition to generating a new certificate, Stripe recommends creating a new Apple Merchant ID as well.\n\nIf you receive the error:\n\n> You haven’t added your Apple merchant account to Stripe\n\nit’s likely your app is sending data encrypted with a previous (non-Stripe) CSR/Certificate. Make sure any certificates generated by non-Stripe CSRs are revoked under your Apple Merchant ID. If this doesn’t resolve the issue, delete the merchant ID in your Apple account and re-create it. Then, create a new certificate based on the same (Stripe-provided) CSR that was previously used. You don’t need to upload this new certificate to Stripe. When finished, toggle the Apple Pay Credentials off and on in your app to ensure they refresh properly.\n\n[](#present-payment-sheet)\n\nIn your [`PlatformPayButton`’s](https://stripe.dev/stripe-react-native/api-reference/index.html#PlatformPayButton) `onPress` prop, call `confirmPlatformPayPayment` to open an Apple Pay sheet. To display the customer’s cart items on the payment sheet, pass the items as an argument:\n\n`import { confirmPlatformPayPayment } from '@stripe/stripe-react-native';  function PaymentScreen() {   // ... see above    const pay = async () => {     const clientSecret = await fetchPaymentIntentClientSecret()     const { error } = await confirmPlatformPayPayment(       clientSecret,       {         applePay: {           cartItems: [             {               label: 'Example item name',               amount: '14.00',               paymentType: PlatformPay.PaymentType.Immediate,             },             {               label: 'Total',               amount: '12.75',               paymentType: PlatformPay.PaymentType.Immediate,             },           ],           merchantCountryCode: 'US',           currencyCode: 'USD',           requiredShippingAddressFields: [             PlatformPay.ContactField.PostalAddress,           ],           requiredBillingContactFields: [PlatformPay.ContactField.PhoneNumber],         },       }     );     if (error) {       // handle error     } else {       Alert.alert('Success', 'Check the logs for payment intent details.');       console.log(JSON.stringify(paymentIntent, null, 2));     }   };    // ... see above }`\n\n## Testing Apple Pay![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nStripe test card information can’t be saved to Wallet in iOS. Instead, Stripe recognizes when you’re using your test [API keys](https://docs.stripe.com/keys) and returns a successful test card token for you to use. This allows you to make test payments using a live card without it being charged.",

Internally, it uses the [native iOS](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-ios) and [Android](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-android) SDKs. To install Stripe’s React Native SDK, run one of the following commands in your project’s directory (depending on which package manager you use):\n\n`yarn add @stripe/stripe-react-native`\n\nNext, install some other necessary dependencies:\n\n*   For iOS, navigate to the **ios** directory and run `pod install` to ensure that you also install the required native dependencies.\n*   For Android, there are no more dependencies to install.\n\n### Stripe initialization![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nTo initialize Stripe in your React Native app, either wrap your payment screen with the `StripeProvider` component, or use the `initStripe` initialization method. Only the API [publishable key](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#obtain-api-keys) in `publishableKey` is required. The following example shows how to initialize Stripe using the `StripeProvider` component.\n\n`import { StripeProvider } from '@stripe/stripe-react-native';  function App() {   return (     <StripeProvider       publishableKey=`\n\n`\"pk_test_TYooMQauvdEDq54NiTphI7jx\"`\n\n      `urlScheme=\"your-url-scheme\" // required for 3D Secure and bank redirects       merchantIdentifier=\"merchant.com.{{YOUR_APP_NAME}}\" // required for Apple Pay     >       // Your app code here     </StripeProvider>   ); }`\n\n#### Note\n\nUse your API keys for [test mode](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#obtain-api-keys) while you test and develop, and your [live mode](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#test-live-modes) keys when you publish your app.\n\n[](#react-native-enable-payment-methods)\n\nView your [payment methods settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) and enable the payment methods you want to support. You need at least one payment method enabled to create a [PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents \"Payment Intents API\").\n\nBy default, Stripe enables cards and other prevalent payment methods that can help you reach more customers, but we recommend turning on additional payment methods that are relevant for your business and customers. See [Payment method integration options](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/integration-options#payment-method-product-support) for product and payment method support, and our [pricing page](https://stripe.com/pricing/local-payment-methods) for fees.\n\n[](#react-native-add-server-endpoint)\n\n#### Note\n\nThis integration uses three Stripe API objects:\n\n1.  [PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents): Stripe uses this to represent your intent to collect payment from a customer, tracking your charge attempts and payment state changes throughout the process.\n    \n2.  (Optional) [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers): To set up a payment method for future payments, you must attach it to a [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers \"Customers\"). Create a Customer object when your customer creates an account with your business. If your customer is making a payment as a guest, you can create a Customer object before payment and associate it with your own internal representation of the customer’s account later.\n    \n3.  (Optional) Customer Ephemeral Key: Information on the Customer object is sensitive, and can’t be retrieved directly from an app. An Ephemeral Key grants the SDK temporary access to the Customer.\n    \n\n#### Note\n\nIf you never save cards to a Customer and don’t allow returning Customers to reuse saved cards, you can omit the Customer and Customer Ephemeral Key objects from your integration.\n\nFor security reasons, your app can’t create these objects. Instead, add an endpoint on your server that:\n\n1.  Retrieves the Customer, or creates a new one.\n2.  Creates an Ephemeral Key for the Customer.\n3.  Creates a PaymentIntent with the [amount](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-amount), [currency](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-currency), and [customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-customer). You can also optionally include the `automatic_payment_methods` parameter. Stripe enables its functionality by default in the latest version of the API.\n4.  Returns the Payment Intent’s [client secret](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-client_secret \"PaymentIntent client secret\"), the Ephemeral Key’s `secret`, the Customer’s [id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-id), and your [publishable key](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys) to your app.\n\nThe payment methods shown to customers during the checkout process are also included on the PaymentIntent. You can let Stripe pull payment methods from your Dashboard settings or you can list them manually. Regardless of the option you choose, know that the currency passed in the PaymentIntent filters the payment methods shown to the customer. For example, if you pass `eur` on the PaymentIntent and have OXXO enabled in the Dashboard, OXXO won’t be shown to the customer because OXXO doesn’t support `eur` payments.\n\nUnless your integration requires a code-based option for offering payment methods, Stripe recommends the automated option. This is because Stripe evaluates the currency, payment method restrictions, and other parameters to determine the list of supported payment methods. Payment methods that increase conversion and that are most relevant to the currency and customer’s location are prioritized.\n\n#### Note\n\nTest a running implementation of this endpoint on [Glitch](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/remix/stripe-mobile-payment-sheet-automatic).\n\nYou can manage payment methods from the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods). Stripe handles the return of eligible payment methods based on factors such as the transaction’s amount, currency, and payment flow. The PaymentIntent is created using the payment methods you configured in the Dashboard. If you don’t want to use the Dashboard or if you want to specify payment methods manually, you can list them using the `payment_method_types` attribute.\n\n`# Create a Customer (use an existing Customer ID if this is a returning customer) curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/customers \\   -u` \n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n``: \\   -X \"POST\"  # Create an Ephemeral Key for the Customer curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/ephemeral_keys \\   -u sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc  : \\   -H \"Stripe-Version: 2024-06-20\" \\   -X \"POST\" \\   -d \"customer\"=\"{{CUSTOMER_ID}}\" \\  # Create a PaymentIntent curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/payment_intents \\   -u sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc  : \\   -X \"POST\" \\   -d \"customer\"=\"{{CUSTOMER_ID}}\" \\   -d \"amount\"=1099 \\   -d \"currency\"=\"eur\" \\   # In the latest version of the API, specifying the `automatic_payment_methods` parameter   # is optional because Stripe enables its functionality by default.   -d \"automatic_payment_methods[enabled]\"=true \\``\n\n[](#react-native-collect-payment-details)\n\nBefore displaying the mobile Payment Element, your checkout page should:\n\n*   Show the products being purchased and the total amount\n*   Collect any required shipping information\n*   Include a checkout button to present Stripe’s UI\n\nIn the checkout of your app, make a network request to the backend endpoint you created in the previous step and call `initPaymentSheet` from the `useStripe` hook.\n\n``export default function CheckoutScreen() {   const { initPaymentSheet, presentPaymentSheet } = useStripe();   const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);    const fetchPaymentSheetParams = async () => {     const response = await fetch(`${API_URL}/payment-sheet`, {       method: 'POST',       headers: {         'Content-Type': 'application/json',       },     });     const { paymentIntent, ephemeralKey, customer} = await response.json();      return {       paymentIntent,       ephemeralKey,       customer,     };   };    const initializePaymentSheet = async () => {     const {       paymentIntent,       ephemeralKey,       customer,       publishableKey,     } = await fetchPaymentSheetParams();      const { error } = await initPaymentSheet({       merchantDisplayName: \"Example, Inc.\",       customerId: customer,       customerEphemeralKeySecret: ephemeralKey,       paymentIntentClientSecret: paymentIntent,       // Set `allowsDelayedPaymentMethods` to true if your business can handle payment       //methods that complete payment after a delay, like SEPA Debit and Sofort.       allowsDelayedPaymentMethods: true,       defaultBillingDetails: {         name: 'Jane Doe',       }     });     if (!error) {       setLoading(true);     }   };    const openPaymentSheet = async () => {     // see below   };    useEffect(() => {     initializePaymentSheet();   }, []);    return (     <Screen>       <Button         variant=\"primary\"         disabled={!loading}         title=\"Checkout\"         onPress={openPaymentSheet}       />     </Screen>   ); }``\n\nWhen your customer taps the **Checkout** button, call `presentPaymentSheet()` to open the sheet. After the customer completes the payment, the sheet is dismissed and the promise resolves with an optional `StripeError<PaymentSheetError>`.\n\n``export default function CheckoutScreen() {   // continued from above    const openPaymentSheet = async () => {     const { error } = await presentPaymentSheet();      if (error) {       Alert.alert(`Error code: ${error.code}`, error.message);     } else {       Alert.alert('Success', 'Your order is confirmed!');     }   };    return (     <Screen>       <Button         variant=\"primary\"         disabled={!loading}         title=\"Checkout\"         onPress={openPaymentSheet}       />     </Screen>   ); }``\n\nIf there is no error, inform the user they’re done (for example, by displaying an order confirmation screen).\n\nSetting `allowsDelayedPaymentMethods` to true allows [delayed notification](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#payment-notification) payment methods like US bank accounts. For these payment methods, the final payment status isn’t known when the `PaymentSheet` completes, and instead succeeds or fails later. If you support these types of payment methods, inform the customer their order is confirmed and only fulfill their order (for example, ship their product) when the payment is successful.\n\n[](#react-native-set-up-return-url)\n\nWhen a customer exits your app, for example to authenticate in Safari or their banking app, provide a way for them to automatically return to your app afterward. Many payment method types **require** a return URL, so if you fail to provide it, we can’t present those payment methods to your user, even if you’ve enabled them.\n\nTo provide a return URL, [configure a custom URL scheme or universal link](https://reactnative.dev/docs/linking) and set up your root component to forward the URL to the Stripe SDK.\n\n#### Note\n\n`import React, { useEffect, useCallback } from 'react'; import { Linking } from 'react-native'; import { useStripe } from '@stripe/stripe-react-native';  export default function MyApp() {   const { handleURLCallback } = useStripe();    const handleDeepLink = useCallback(     async (url: string | null) => {       if (url) {         const stripeHandled = await handleURLCallback(url);         if (stripeHandled) {           // This was a Stripe URL - you can return or add extra handling here as you see fit         } else {           // This was NOT a Stripe URL – handle as you normally would         }       }     },     [handleURLCallback]   );    useEffect(() => {     const getUrlAsync = async () => {       const initialUrl = await Linking.getInitialURL();       handleDeepLink(initialUrl);     };      getUrlAsync();      const deepLinkListener = Linking.addEventListener(       'url',       (event: { url: string }) => {         handleDeepLink(event.url);       }     );      return () => deepLinkListener.remove();   }, [handleDeepLink]);    return (     <View>       <AwesomeAppComponent />     </View>   ); }`\n\nAdditionally, set the `returnURL` when you call the `initPaymentSheet` method:\n\n`await initPaymentSheet({   ...   returnURL: 'your-app://stripe-redirect',   ... });`\n\nFor more information on native URL schemes, refer to the [Android](https://developer.android.com/training/app-links/deep-linking) and [iOS](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/allowing_apps_and_websites_to_link_to_your_content/defining_a_custom_url_scheme_for_your_app) docs.\n\n[](#react-native-fulfillment)\n\nStripe sends a [payment\\_intent.succeeded](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-payment_intent.succeeded) event when the payment completes. Use the [Dashboard webhook tool](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks) or follow the [webhook guide](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks/quickstart) to receive these events and run actions, such as sending an order confirmation email to your customer, logging the sale in a database, or starting a shipping workflow.\n\nListen for these events rather than waiting on a callback from the client. On the client, the customer could close the browser window or quit the app before the callback executes, and malicious clients could manipulate the response. Setting up your integration to listen for asynchronous events is what enables you to accept [different types of payment methods](https://stripe.com/payments/payment-methods-guide) with a single integration.\n\nIn addition to handling the `payment_intent.succeeded` event, we recommend handling these other events when collecting payments with the Payment Element:\n\n| Event | Description | Action |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| [payment\\_intent.succeeded](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types?lang=php#event_types-payment_intent.succeeded) | Sent when a customer successfully completes a payment. | Send the customer an order confirmation and fulfill their order. |\n| [payment\\_intent.processing](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types?lang=php#event_types-payment_intent.processing) | Sent when a customer successfully initiates a payment, but the payment has yet to complete. This event is most commonly sent when the customer initiates a bank debit. It’s followed by either a `payment_intent.succeeded` or `payment_intent.payment_failed` event in the future. | Send the customer an order confirmation that indicates their payment is pending. For digital goods, you might want to fulfill the order before waiting for payment to complete. |\n| [payment\\_intent.payment\\_failed](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types?lang=php#event_types-payment_intent.payment_failed) | Sent when a customer attempts a payment, but the payment fails. | If a payment transitions from `processing` to `payment_failed`, offer the customer another attempt to pay. |\n\n[](#react-native-test)\n\n| Card number | Scenario | How to test |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|     | The card payment succeeds and doesn’t require authentication. | Fill out the credit card form using the credit card number with any expiration, CVC, and postal code. |\n|     | The card payment requires [authentication](https://docs.stripe.com/strong-customer-authentication \"Strong Customer Authentication\"). | Fill out the credit card form using the credit card number with any expiration, CVC, and postal code. |\n|     | The card is declined with a decline code like `insufficient_funds`. | Fill out the credit card form using the credit card number with any expiration, CVC, and postal code. |\n|     | The UnionPay card has a variable length of 13-19 digits. | Fill out the credit card form using the credit card number with any expiration, CVC, and postal code. |\n\nSee [Testing](https://docs.stripe.com/testing) for additional information to test your integration.",

    "markdown": "# Google Pay | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Learn how to accept payments using Google Pay.\n\nGoogle Pay allows customers to make payments in your app or website using any credit or debit card saved to their Google Account, including those from Google Play, YouTube, Chrome, or an Android device. Use the Google Pay API to request any credit or debit card stored in your customer’s Google account.\n\nGoogle Pay is fully compatible with Stripe’s products and features (for example, recurring payments), allowing you to use it in place of a traditional payment form whenever possible. Use it to accept payments for physical goods, donations, [subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/creating \"subscriptions\"), and so on.\n\n## Using Stripe and Google Pay versus the Google Play billing system![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nFor sales of physical goods and services, your app can accept Google Pay or any other Stripe-supported payment method. Those payments are processed through Stripe, and you only need to pay Stripe’s [processing fees](https://stripe.com/pricing). However, in-app purchases of digital products and content must use the [Google Play billing system](https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing). Those payments are processed by Google and are subject to their transaction fees.\n\nFor more information about which purchases must use the Google Play billing system, see Google Play’s [developer terms](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/10281818).\n\nStripe’s React Native SDK is the fastest and easiest way to start accepting Google Pay in your React Native apps. The [`PlatformPayButton`](https://stripe.dev/stripe-react-native/api-reference/index.html#PlatformPayButton) component wraps Google’s required UI, and you can use the `confirmPlatformPayPayment` and `createPlatformPayPaymentMethod` methods to seamlessly collect or create payments in your app with minimal setup.\n\n[](#react-native-setup)\n\n### Server-side ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nThis integration requires endpoints on your server that talk to the Stripe API.

Only the API [publishable key](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#obtain-api-keys) in `publishableKey` is required. The following example shows how to initialize Stripe using the `StripeProvider` component.\n\n`import { StripeProvider } from '@stripe/stripe-react-native';  function App() {   return (     <StripeProvider       publishableKey=`\n\n`\"pk_test_TYooMQauvdEDq54NiTphI7jx\"`\n\n      `urlScheme=\"your-url-scheme\" // required for 3D Secure and bank redirects       merchantIdentifier=\"merchant.com.{{YOUR_APP_NAME}}\" // required for Apple Pay     >       // Your app code here     </StripeProvider>   ); }`\n\n#### Note\n\nUse your API keys for [test mode](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#obtain-api-keys) while you test and develop, and your [live mode](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#test-live-modes) keys when you publish your app.\n\n[](#react-native-create-enable-google-pay)\n\nTo use Google Pay, first enable the Google Pay API by adding the following to the `<application>` tag of your **AndroidManifest.xml**:\n\n`<application>   ...   <meta-data     android:name=\"com.google.android.gms.wallet.api.enabled\"     android:value=\"true\" /> </application>`\n\nFor more details, see Google Pay’s [Set up Google Pay API](https://developers.google.com/pay/api/android/guides/setup) for Android.\n\n[](#react-native-create-payment-intent)\n\nFirst, create a `PaymentIntent` on your server and specify the amount to collect and the currency. If you already have an integration using the [Payment Intents API](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents), add `card` to the list of [payment method types](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-payment_method_types) for your `PaymentIntent` (this is also the default payment method if none are provided):\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/payment_intents \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d \"payment_method_types[]\"=card \\  -d amount=1099 \\  -d currency=usd`\n\nA PaymentIntent includes a [client secret](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-client_secret \"PaymentIntent client secret\"). You can use the client secret in your React Native app to securely complete the payment process instead of passing back the entire PaymentIntent object. In your app, request a PaymentIntent from your server and store its client secret.\n\n[](#react-native-init)\n\nFirst, check whether or not the device supports Google Pay by calling `isPlatformPaySupported`.\n\n`import { usePlatformPay } from '@stripe/stripe-react-native';  function PaymentScreen() {   const { isPlatformPaySupported } = usePlatformPay();    React.useEffect(() => {     (async function () {       if (!(await isPlatformPaySupported({ googlePay: {testEnv: true} }))) {         Alert.alert('Google Pay is not supported.');         return;       }     })();   }, []);    ...    return (     <View >       ...     </View>   ); }`\n\n[](#react-native-present)\n\nAfter you know Google Pay is available and your app has obtained a `PaymentIntent` or `SetupIntent` client secret, call `confirmPlatformPayPayment`. When confirming a `SetupIntent`, use `confirmPlatformPaySetupIntent` instead.\n\n``import {PlatformPayButton, usePlatformPay} from '@stripe/stripe-react-native';  function PaymentScreen() {   const {     isPlatformPaySupported,     confirmPlatformPayPayment,   } = usePlatformPay();    React.useEffect(() => {     ... // see above   }, []);    const fetchPaymentIntentClientSecret = async () => {     // Fetch payment intent created on the server, see above     const response = await fetch(`${API_URL}/create-payment-intent`, {       method: 'POST',       headers: {         'Content-Type': 'application/json',       },       body: JSON.stringify({         currency: 'usd',       }),     });     const { clientSecret } = await response.json();      return clientSecret;   };    const pay = async () => {     const clientSecret = await fetchPaymentIntentClientSecret();      const { error } = await confirmPlatformPayPayment(       clientSecret,       {         googlePay: {           testEnv: true,           merchantName: 'My merchant name',           merchantCountryCode: 'US',           currencyCode: 'USD',           billingAddressConfig: {             format: PlatformPay.BillingAddressFormat.Full,             isPhoneNumberRequired: true,             isRequired: true,           },         },       }     );      if (error) {       Alert.alert(error.code, error.message);       // Update UI to prompt user to retry payment (and possibly another payment method)       return;     }     Alert.alert('Success', 'The payment was confirmed successfully.');   };    return (     <View >       <PlatformPayButton         type={PlatformPay.ButtonType.Pay}         onPress={pay}         style={{           width: '100%',           height: 50,         }}       />     </View>   ); }``\n\n[](#going-live-react-native)\n\nFollow [Google’s instructions](https://developers.google.com/pay/api/android/guides/test-and-deploy/request-prod-access) to request production access for your app. Choose the integration type **Gateway** when prompted, and provide screenshots of your app for review.\n\nAfter your app has been approved, test your integration in production by using `testEnv: false`, and launching Google Pay from a signed, release build of your app. Remember to use your live mode [API keys](https://docs.stripe.com/keys). You can use a `PaymentIntent` with [`capture_method` = `manual`](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-capture_method) to process a transaction without capturing the payment.",

Fine-tune [specific components](#specific-ui-components-android)\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/android-appearance-before-after-example.acf584a69eb99f47fe0b5ffab24818b8.png)\n\n`// The following code creates the appearance shown in the screenshot above val appearance = PaymentSheet.Appearance(    colorsLight = PaymentSheet.Colors(        primary = Color(red = 36, green = 36, blue = 47),        surface = Color.White,        component = Color(red = 243, green = 248, blue = 245),        componentBorder = Color.Transparent,        componentDivider = Color.Black,        onComponent = Color.Black,        subtitle = Color.Black,        placeholderText = Color(red = 115, green = 117, blue = 123),        onSurface = Color.Black,        appBarIcon = Color.Black,        error = Color.Red,    ),    shapes = PaymentSheet.Shapes(        cornerRadiusDp = 12.0f,        borderStrokeWidthDp = 0.5f    ),    typography = PaymentSheet.Typography.default.copy(        fontResId = R.font.avenir_next    ),    primaryButton = PaymentSheet.PrimaryButton(    shape = PaymentSheet.PrimaryButtonShape(        cornerRadiusDp = 20f    ), )  // ...  paymentSheet.presentWithPaymentIntent(    clientSecret,    PaymentSheet.Configuration(        merchantDisplayName = merchantName,        appearance = appearance    ) )`\n\n[\n\n## Fonts![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n\n\n](#fonts-android)\n\nCustomize the font by setting [`typography.fontResId`](https://stripe.dev/stripe-android/paymentsheet/com.stripe.android.paymentsheet/-payment-sheet/-typography/index.html#-786783041%2FProperties%2F2002900378) to your custom font’s resource ID. The mobile Payment Element uses the font family of your custom font, but determines sizes and weights itself.\n\nTo increase or decrease the size of text, set [`typography.sizeScaleFactor`](https://stripe.dev/stripe-android/paymentsheet/com.stripe.android.paymentsheet/-payment-sheet/-typography/index.html#1477076499%2FProperties%2F2002900378). We multiply font sizes by this value before displaying them. This is useful if your custom font is slightly larger or smaller than the system font.\n\n`val appearance = PaymentSheet.Appearance(   // …   typography = PaymentSheet.Typography.default.copy(     sizeScaleFactor = 1.15f, // Increase the size of all text by 1.15x     fontResId = R.font.myFont ) val configuration = PaymentSheet.Configuration(   // …   appearance = appearance )`\n\n[\n\n## Colors![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n\n\n](#colors-android)\n\nCustomize the colors in the mobile Payment Element by modifying the color categories defined in [`PaymentSheet.Colors`](https://stripe.dev/stripe-android/paymentsheet/com.stripe.android.paymentsheet/-payment-sheet/-colors/index.html). Each color category determines the color of one or more components in the UI. For example, [`primary`](https://stripe.dev/stripe-android/paymentsheet/com.stripe.android.paymentsheet/-payment-sheet/-colors/index.html#1242160296%2FProperties%2F2002900378) defines the color of the **Pay** button and selected items like the **Save this card** checkbox. Refer to the diagram below to see some of the UI elements associated with each color category.\n\n#### Note\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/android-appearance-colors.bf8f8a6f253d483a4ed77dc359b7ac87.png)\n\n[\n\n## Specific UI components![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n\n\n](#specific-ui-components-android)\n\nThe sections above describe customization options that affect the mobile Payment Element broadly, across multiple UI components. We also provide customization options specifically for the primary button (for example, the **Pay** button). Refer to [Appearance.PrimaryButton](https://stripe.dev/stripe-android/paymentsheet/com.stripe.android.paymentsheet/-payment-sheet/-primary-button/index.html) for the full list of customization options.\n\nCustomization options for specific UI components take precedence over other values. For example, `appearance.primaryButton.shapes.cornerRadius` overrides the value of `appearance.shapes.cornerRadius`.\n\n#### Note\n\n[Let us know](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-android/issues/new/choose) if you think we need to add more customization options.",

You can use the Customer Sheet UI outside of a checkout flow, and the appearance and styling is customizable to match the appearance and aesthetic of your app. Customers can add and remove payment methods, which get saved to the customer object, and set their default payment method stored locally on the device. Use both the Mobile Payment Element and the Customer Sheet to provide customers a consistent end-to-end solution for saved payment methods.\n\n![Screenshot of Customer Sheet presenting multiple saved payment methods in an iOS app.](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/ios-landing.6c4969968fd6efe3d39fe673628f8284.png)",

    "markdown": "# Google Pay | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Learn how to accept payments using Google Pay.\n\nGoogle Pay allows customers to make payments in your app or website using any credit or debit card saved to their Google Account, including those from Google Play, YouTube, Chrome, or an Android device. Use the Google Pay API to request any credit or debit card stored in your customer’s Google account.\n\nGoogle Pay is fully compatible with Stripe’s products and features (for example, recurring payments), allowing you to use it in place of a traditional payment form whenever possible. Use it to accept payments for physical goods, donations, [subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/creating \"subscriptions\"), and so on.\n\n## Using Stripe and Google Pay versus the Google Play billing system![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nFor sales of physical goods and services, your app can accept Google Pay or any other Stripe-supported payment method. Those payments are processed through Stripe, and you only need to pay Stripe’s [processing fees](https://stripe.com/pricing). However, in-app purchases of digital products and content must use the [Google Play billing system](https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing). Those payments are processed by Google and are subject to their transaction fees.\n\nFor more information about which purchases must use the Google Play billing system, see Google Play’s [developer terms](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/10281818).\n\n## Accept a payment using Google Pay in your Android app ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\n`GooglePayLauncher`, part of the Stripe Android SDK, is the fastest and easiest way to start accepting Google Pay in your Android apps.\n\n[](#html-js-prerequisites)\n\nTo support Google Pay in Android, you need the following:\n\n*   A `minSdkVersion` of `19` or higher.\n*   A `compileSdkVersion` of `28` or higher.\n\nAdditionally, if you wish to test with your own device, you need to [add a payment method to your Google Account](https://support.google.com/wallet/answer/12058983?visit_id=637947092743186187-653786796&rd=1).\n\n[](#setup)\n\nTo use Google Pay, first enable the Google Pay API by adding the following to the `<application>` tag of your **AndroidManifest.xml**:\n\n`<application>   ...   <meta-data     android:name=\"com.google.android.gms.wallet.api.enabled\"     android:value=\"true\" /> </application>`\n\nThis guide assumes you’re using the latest version of the Stripe Android SDK.\n\n`dependencies {     implementation 'com.stripe:stripe-android:20.48.0' }`\n\nFor more details, see Google Pay’s [Set up Google Pay API](https://developers.google.com/pay/api/android/guides/setup) for Android.\n\n[](#button)\n\nAdd the Google Pay button to your app by following [Google’s tutorial](https://developers.google.com/pay/api/android/guides/tutorial#add-button). This ensures you’re using the correct assets.\n\n[](#instantiate)\n\nNext, create an instance of [GooglePayLauncher](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-android/blob/master/payments-core/src/main/java/com/stripe/android/googlepaylauncher/GooglePayLauncher.kt) in your `Activity` or `Fragment`. This must be done in `Activity#onCreate()`.\n\n`GooglePayLauncher.Config` exposes both required and optional properties that configure `GooglePayLauncher`. See `GooglePayLauncher.Config` for more details on the configuration options.\n\n``import com.google.android.gms.wallet.button.PayButton  class CheckoutActivity : AppCompatActivity() {     // fetch client_secret from backend     private lateinit var clientSecret: String      private lateinit var googlePayButton: PayButton      override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {         super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)         setContentView(R.layout.checkout_activity)          PaymentConfiguration.init(this, PUBLISHABLE_KEY)          googlePayButton = /* TODO: Initialize button by following Google's guide. */          val googlePayLauncher = GooglePayLauncher(             activity = this,             config = GooglePayLauncher.Config(                 environment = GooglePayEnvironment.Test,                 merchantCountryCode = \"US\",                 merchantName = \"Widget Store\"             ),             readyCallback = ::onGooglePayReady,             resultCallback = ::onGooglePayResult         )          googlePayButton.setOnClickListener {             // launch `GooglePayLauncher` to confirm a Payment Intent             googlePayLauncher.presentForPaymentIntent(clientSecret)         }     }      private fun onGooglePayReady(isReady: Boolean) {         // implemented below     }      private fun onGooglePayResult(result: GooglePayLauncher.Result) {         // implemented below     } }``\n\nAfter instantiating `GooglePayLauncher`, the `GooglePayLauncher.ReadyCallback` instance is called with a flag indicating whether Google Pay is available and ready to use. This flag can be used to update your UI to indicate to your customer that Google Pay is ready to be used.\n\n`import com.google.android.gms.wallet.button.PayButton  class CheckoutActivity : AppCompatActivity() {     // continued from above      private lateinit var googlePayButton: PayButton      private fun onGooglePayReady(isReady: Boolean) {         googlePayButton.isEnabled = isReady     } }`\n\n[](#launch-google-pay)\n\nAfter Google Pay is available and your app has obtained a `PaymentIntent` or `SetupIntent` client secret, launch `GooglePayLauncher` using the appropriate method. When confirming a `PaymentIntent`, use `GooglePayLauncher#presentForPaymentIntent(clientSecret)`. When confirming a `SetupIntent`, use `GooglePayLauncher#presentForSetupIntent(clientSecret)`.\n\n``import com.google.android.gms.wallet.button.PayButton  class CheckoutActivity : AppCompatActivity() {     // fetch client_secret from backend     private lateinit var clientSecret: String      private lateinit var googlePayButton: PayButton      override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {         super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)          // instantiate `googlePayLauncher`          googlePayButton.setOnClickListener {             // launch `GooglePayLauncher` to confirm a Payment Intent             googlePayLauncher.presentForPaymentIntent(clientSecret)         }     } }``\n\n[\n\n## Handle the result![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n\n\n](#handle-result)\n\nFinally, implement `GooglePayLauncher.ResultCallback` to handle the result of the `GooglePayLauncher` operation.\n\nThe result can be `GooglePayLauncher.Result.Completed`, `GooglePayLauncher.Result.Canceled`, or `GooglePayLauncher.Result.Failed`.\n\n``class CheckoutActivity : AppCompatActivity() {     // continued from above      private fun onGooglePayResult(result: GooglePayLauncher.Result) {         when (result) {             GooglePayLauncher.Result.Completed -> {                 // Payment succeeded, show a receipt view             }             GooglePayLauncher.Result.Canceled -> {                 // User canceled the operation             }             is GooglePayLauncher.Result.Failed -> {                 // Operation failed; inspect `result.error` for the exception             }         }     } }``\n\n[](#going-live)\n\nFollow [Google’s instructions](https://developers.google.com/pay/api/android/guides/test-and-deploy/request-prod-access) to request production access for your app. Choose the integration type **Gateway** when prompted, and provide screenshots of your app for review.\n\nAfter your app has been approved, test your integration in production by setting the environment to `GooglePayEnvironment.Production`, and launching Google Pay from a signed, release build of your app. Remember to use your live mode [API keys](https://docs.stripe.com/keys). You can use a `PaymentIntent` with [`capture_method` = `manual`](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-capture_method) to process a transaction without capturing the payment.\n\n## Creating a PaymentMethod![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nIf you confirm your payment on your server, you can use `GooglePayPaymentMethodLauncher` to only collect a `PaymentMethod` instead of confirm payment.\n\n``import com.google.android.gms.wallet.button.PayButton  class CheckoutActivity : AppCompatActivity() {     private lateinit var googlePayButton: PayButton      override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {         super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)         setContentView(R.layout.checkout_activity)          PaymentConfiguration.init(this, PUBLISHABLE_KEY)          googlePayButton = /* TODO: Initialize button by following Google's guide. */          val googlePayLauncher = GooglePayPaymentMethodLauncher(             activity = this,             config = GooglePayPaymentMethodLauncher.Config(                 environment = GooglePayEnvironment.Test,                 merchantCountryCode = \"FR\",                 merchantName = \"Widget Store\"             ),             readyCallback = ::onGooglePayReady,             resultCallback = ::onGooglePayResult         )          googlePayButton.setOnClickListener {             googlePayLauncher.present(                 currencyCode = \"EUR\",                 amount = 2500             )         }     }      private fun onGooglePayReady(isReady: Boolean) {         googlePayButton.isEnabled = isReady     }      private fun onGooglePayResult(         result: GooglePayPaymentMethodLauncher.Result     ) {         when (result) {             is GooglePayPaymentMethodLauncher.Result.Completed -> {                 // Payment details successfully captured.                 // Send the paymentMethodId to your server to finalize payment.                 val paymentMethodId = result.paymentMethod.id             }             GooglePayPaymentMethodLauncher.Result.Canceled -> {                 // User canceled the operation             }             is GooglePayPaymentMethodLauncher.Result.Failed -> {                 // Operation failed; inspect `result.error` for the exception             }         }     } }``",

By default, the autocomplete is enabled with a Stripe provided Google Maps API key if any of the following conditions are met:\n\n*   In a single page checkout flow where the [Payment Element](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-element) is mounted in the same elements group as the Address Element.\n*   In a checkout flow that uses the Address Element in an active [Link](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link) session.\n\nTo enable autocomplete in the Address Element for all other scenarios, you can use the [`autocomplete`](https://docs.stripe.com/js/elements_object/create_address_element#address_element_create-options-autocomplete) option with `mode` set to `google_maps_api`. Set the `apiKey` to be your own [Google Maps API key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key#create-api-keys) that’s configured to allow the [Places API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/places#add-places-api-to-the-api-keys-api-restrictions-list) usage.

If you’re not sure if your business is a prohibited business, or have questions about how these requirements apply to you, please [contact support](https://support.stripe.com/contact/login).\n\n## Get started ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nYou don’t have to integrate Alipay and other payment methods individually. If you use our front-end products, Stripe automatically determines the most relevant payment methods to display. Go to the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) and enable Alipay. To get started with one of our hosted UIs, follow a quickstart:\n\n*   [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/quickstart): Our prebuilt, hosted checkout page.\n*   [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/quickstart): Our drop-in UI components.\n\n[Payment Links](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links) also supports adding Alipay from the Dashboard.\n\nIf you prefer to manually list payment methods, learn how to [manually configure Alipay as a payment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/alipay/accept-a-payment).\n\n## Disputed payments ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nAlipay payments have a low risk of fraud or unrecognized payments because the customer must authenticate the payment, so no dispute process exists that could create chargebacks and withdraw funds from your Stripe account. If an Alipay user contacts them about a problem with a transaction, they might direct that user to you for a resolution.\n\n## Refunds ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nYou can refund Alipay payments up to 90 days after the original payment. Refunds for Alipay payments are asynchronous and take up to 5 minutes to complete. Stripe notifies you of the final refund status using the `charge.refund.updated` [webhook](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks \"webhook\") event. When a refund succeeds, the status of the [Refund](https://docs.stripe.com/api/refunds/object) object transitions to `succeeded`. If a refund fails, the status of the Refund object transitions to `failed` and Stripe returns the amount to your Stripe balance. At this point, you need to arrange an alternative way of providing your customer with a refund.\n\n## Supported currencies![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYou can create Alipay payments in the currencies that map to your country. The default local currency for Alipay is `cny` and customers also see their purchase amount in `cny`.\n\n| Currency | Country |\n| --- | --- |\n| `cny` | Any country |\n| `aud` | Australia |\n| `cad` | Canada |\n| `eur` | Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland |\n| `gbp` | United Kingdom |\n| `hkd` | Hong Kong |\n| `jpy` | Japan |\n| `myr` | Malaysia |\n| `nzd` | New Zealand |\n| `sgd` | Singapore |\n| `usd` | United States |\n\nIf you have a bank account in another currency and would like to create an Alipay payment in that currency, you can [contact support](https://support.stripe.com/email). Support for additional currencies is provided on a case-by-case basis.",

It allows your customer to [authenticate and approve](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#customer-actions) payments using the MobilePay app.\n\nWhen your customer pays with MobilePay, Stripe performs a card transaction using the card data we receive from MobilePay. The processing of the card transaction is invisible to your integration, and Stripe [immediately notifies you](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#payment-notification) whether the payment succeeded or failed.\n\n*   **Customer locations**\n    \n    Denmark and Finland\n    \n*   **Presentment currency**\n    \n    DKK, EUR, NOK, SEK\n    \n*   **Payment confirmation**\n    \n    Customer-initiated\n    \n*   **Payment method family**\n    \n    Digital wallet\n    \n*   **Recurring payments**\n    \n    No\n    \n*   **Payout timing**\n    \n    [Standard payout timing](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts#payout-speed) applies\n    \n*   **Connect support**\n    \n    Yes\n    \n*   **Dispute support**\n    \n    Yes\n    \n*   **Manual capture support**\n    \n    Yes\n    \n*   **Refunds / Partial refunds**\n    \n    Yes / yes\n    \n\n## Payment flows ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nCustomers pay with MobilePay by using one of the following methods:\n\nCustomers follow a mobile redirect from your website or mobile app to the MobilePay app where they authorize the payment, then return to your website or mobile app.\n\n## Get started ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nYou don’t have to integrate MobilePay and other payment methods individually. If you use our front-end products, Stripe automatically determines the most relevant payment methods to display. Go to the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) and enable MobilePay. To get started with one of our hosted UIs, follow a quickstart:\n\n*   [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/quickstart): Our prebuilt, hosted checkout page.\n*   [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/quickstart): Our drop-in UI components.\n\n### Other payment products![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe following Stripe products also let you add MobilePay from the Dashboard:\n\n*   [Payment Links](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links)\n\nYou can also [manually configure MobilePay as a payment method](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/mobilepay/accept-a-payment).\n\n## MobilePay with Connect ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nYou can use [Stripe Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/overview) with MobilePay to process payments. Connect users can use MobilePay with the following charge types:\n\n*   [Direct](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges)\n*   [Destination](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges)\n*   [Separate charges and transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n\n### Enable MobilePay for connected accounts![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nConnected accounts with access to the full Stripe Dashboard can enable MobilePay in their [Payment methods settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods). To check which accounts have enabled MobilePay, use the `capabilities` hash in our [accounts webhooks or APIs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-capabilities-mobilepay_payments) to see if the `mobilepay_payments` capability is set to `active`.\n\nFor connected accounts that don’t have access to the full Stripe Dashboard, see [enable payment methods for your connected accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-capabilities). The name of the connected account is the name customers see during checkout and in the MobilePay app.\n\n## Refunds![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nMobilePay supports full and partial refunds. You can also issue multiple partial refunds up to the amount of the original charge.\n\n## Disputed payments![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nMobilePay allows transaction disputes. Customers can open disputes directly with their cards issuer for cases of suspected fraud, double payments, or a difference between an order and a transaction amount. You can submit evidence to contest a dispute directly. The dispute process is the same as that for card payments. Learn how to [manage disputes](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/responding).\n\n## Card transaction retries![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nMobilePay allows customers to retry payments in-app before marking a payment as failed and redirecting to your website. When a card transaction fails, the customer can retry a payment using a different card, which might result in a successful payment.\n\n## 3D Secure authentication![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nCertain cards or banks might require an additional card authentication step to process the MobilePay transaction.\n\nWhen this occurs, the customer is presented with a WebView dialog in the MobilePay application, prompting them to authorize the payment. The need to perform a [3D Secure challenge](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure \"3D Secure (3DS)\") is invisible to your integration and there are no extra integration steps for you to handle.\n\nThe expected impact varies, depending on customer country and card network:\n\n| Country | Card brand | Payments requiring 3DS step-up |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Denmark | Visa | ~1% |\n| Denmark | Mastercard | ~1.5% |\n| Finland | Visa | ~5% |\n| Finland | Mastercard | ~7% |\n\n### Liability shift![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n[Liability shift](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure/authentication-flow#disputed-payments) doesn’t apply to MobilePay payments unless [3D Secure authentication](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure \"3D Secure (3DS)\") has taken place. MobilePay doesn’t allow you the option to enforce 3D Secure authentication on the underlying card payment.\n\n## Prohibited business categories ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nIn addition to the categories of [businesses restricted from using Stripe](https://stripe.com/restricted-businesses), the following categories are specifically prohibited from using MobilePay:\n\n*   Cryptocurrencies\n*   Stock trade\n*   Gambling\n*   Betting\n*   Bonds\n*   Money transfers\n*   Debt collection\n*   Multi-level marketing and pyramid schemes\n\nFor more information about MobilePay eligibility for your account, review your [Payment methods settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) in the Dashboard.\n\n## Current limitations![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n### Account icons![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe MobilePay transaction confirmation page displays the default Stripe account icon instead of a configurable custom logo. Stripe will notify you when feature improvements become available so you can update your account configuration as needed.\n\n![A screenshot of a successful MobilePay payment.](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/mobilepay-no-merchant-logo.f6f41b7fecbbd48cfabcbff85521ec6d.png)\n\nAn example confirmation page for a successful MobilePay payment.\n\n### Manual captures![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nAt this time, MobilePay only supports automatic captures and [manual captures of the full amount](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/place-a-hold-on-a-payment-method). Stripe will notify you as feature improvements become available for manual captures of partial amounts.\n\n### Dankort support![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nStripe currently doesn’t have support for the Dankort card network. If a customer chooses to pay with a Dankort-branded card, Stripe processes the payment on the Visa and Mastercard networks instead.\n\n## Fees![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nStripe receives card data from MobilePay to process card transactions using Stripe’s Visa and Mastercard integrations. Because MobilePay payments are card transactions, you incur the following fees for each successful transaction:\n\n*   Stripe processing fees associated with the card transaction\n*   Applicable taxes\n*   MobilePay transaction processing fee\n*   An additional monthly membership fee (applicable only to businesses registered in Denmark)\n\nThe MobilePay transaction fee isn’t subtracted immediately from the transaction. Instead, Stripe bills them once a day.\n\n### Stripe processing fees and taxes![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nAfter a successful transaction, Stripe automatically deducts the Stripe transaction fees and applicable taxes from the original transaction amount and provides the remaining amount on your Stripe balance. These fees are identical to a standard card transaction.\n\nMobilePay is subject to the [standard payout schedule applicable to your country](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts).\n\n### MobilePay processing fee![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe MobilePay processing fee isn’t presented within the net amount of a successful transaction. Instead, Stripe bills the MobilePay processing fee once a day, at which point we automatically deduct the sum that you owe from your [Stripe balance](https://dashboard.stripe.com/balance).\n\n### MobilePay monthly processing fee![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nMobilePay charges a fixed 35 DKK monthly membership fee to all businesses registered in Denmark that use its services. Stripe bills this fee once a month (if applicable), at which point we automatically deduct the sum that you owe from your [Stripe balance](https://dashboard.stripe.com/balance).\n\nThe incurred MobilePay fees are listed as a separate entry on your monthly tax invoice. You can find your monthly invoices in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/documents).",

This demo includes an example of a connected account onboarding experience and account management for Rocket Rides, an on-demand marketplace.\n\nYou can find the demo’s [complete source code](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-connect-rocketrides) on GitHub.\n\n![Rocket Rides, a demo of Stripe Connect with Express connected accounts](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/rocket-rides-new.e01ced22698d7f5d3d1c915f26175dcd.png)\n\n## Before you begin![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nTo create Express connected accounts, you must meet all of these requirements:\n\n*   **Minimum API version**: Express connected accounts require API version 2017-05-25 or later. [Capabilities](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-capabilities) require API version 2019-02-19 or later.\n*   **Platform in a supported country**: Platforms in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, the United Kingdom, and the United States can create Express accounts for most countries [Stripe supports](https://stripe.com/global). For information about country-specific restrictions, or to request notification when Express accounts become available in your country, [contact us](mailto:connect@stripe.com).\n*   **Countries that don’t support self-serve**: Due to restrictions that apply when using Connect in the [United Arab Emirates](https://support.stripe.com/questions/connect-availability-in-the-uae) and [Thailand](https://support.stripe.com/questions/stripe-thailand-support-for-marketplace), platform users in these countries can’t self-serve Express connected accounts. To begin onboarding for Express connected accounts in these countries, [contact us](https://stripe.com/contact/sales).\n*   **Platforms in the UAE**: Platforms in the UAE can only use Express connected accounts based in the UAE with the following charge types: [destination\\_charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges) and [separate charges and transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers). Destination charges using the [on\\_behalf\\_of](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-on_behalf_of) attribute are not yet supported for UAE platforms.\n*   **Vetting for fraud**: Because your platform is responsible for losses incurred by Express connected accounts, you must closely examine all accounts that sign up through your platform for potential fraud. Refer to our [risk management best practices guide](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/risk-management/best-practices#fraud) for more information.\n*   **Platform profile**: You need to complete your [platform’s profile](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/registration).\n\n## Onboarding Express connected accounts outside of your platform’s country ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nYou can enable onboarding on a per-country basis in the [Connect Settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/applications/settings) section of your Dashboard.\n\nThe Express account onboarding flow is currently localized in English, French, Spanish, Bulgarian, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Estonian, Finnish, German, Greek, Hungarian, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Latvian, Lithuanian, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Slovak, Slovenian, Swedish, and Thai.\n\nKeep the following in mind when onboarding accounts globally:\n\n*   **International business:** Your platform is responsible for understanding the implications of doing business internationally, such as tax and financial reporting.\n*   **Charge flows:** Be sure to review your options for [creating charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/charges) based on the countries you intend to operate in.\n*   **Service agreement type:** Your platform can create connected accounts under the [recipient service agreement](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/service-agreement-types#recipient) to enable [cross-border transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-capabilities#transfers-cross-border). Such accounts have restricted access to capabilities.\n\n[](#configure-onboarding)\n\nBefore onboarding your first account, go to the [Connect settings page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/applications/settings) to customize the visual appearance of the form with your brand’s name, color, and icon. Connect Onboarding requires this information.\n\n[](#create-account)\n\nUse the [Create Account](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/create) API to create a connected account with `type` set to `express`. You can prefill any information, but at a minimum, you must specify the `type`. The country of the account defaults to the same country as your platform, and the account confirms the selection during onboarding.\n\n#### Note\n\nThis example includes only some of the fields you can set when creating an account. For a full list of the fields you can set, such as `address` and `website_url`, see the [Create Account API reference](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/create).\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/accounts \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d type=express`\n\nIf you know the country and [capabilities](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-capabilities) for your connected account, you can provide that information when you create the account. Connect Onboarding then collects the requirements for those capabilities. To reduce onboarding effort, request only the capabilities you need.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/accounts \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d country=US \\  -d type=express \\  -d \"capabilities[card_payments][requested]\"=true \\  -d \"capabilities[transfers][requested]\"=true \\  -d business_type=individual \\   --data-urlencode \"business_profile[url]\"=\"[https://example.com](https://example.com/)\"`\n\nIf you’ve already collected information for your connected accounts, you can prefill that information on the account object. You can prefill any account information, including personal and business information, external account information, and so on.\n\nConnect Onboarding doesn’t ask for the prefilled information. However, it does ask the account holder to confirm the prefilled information before accepting the [Connect service agreement](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/service-agreement-types).\n\nWhen you onboard an account without its own website and your platform provides it with a personal URL, prefill its `business_profile.url`. If the account doesn’t have a URL, you can prefill its `business_profile.product_description` instead.\n\nWhen testing your integration, prefill account information using [test data](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/testing).\n\nIf you omit `capabilities`, Connect Onboarding uses the settings in the [Configuration settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/applications/settings/express) section of the Stripe Dashboard to automatically request capabilities based on the account’s country.\n\n[](#create-link)\n\n[Create an Account Link](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_links/create) with the following parameters:\n\n*   `account` - use the account ID returned by the API from the previous step\n*   `refresh_url`\n*   `return_url`\n*   `type` = `account_onboarding`\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/account_links \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d account=  {{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}   \\   --data-urlencode refresh_url=\"[https://example.com/reauth](https://example.com/reauth)\" \\   --data-urlencode return_url=\"[https://example.com/return](https://example.com/return)\" \\  -d type=account_onboarding`\n\n[](#redirect-link)\n\nAn [Account Link](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_links/object) contains a `url`. Redirect the account to this link to send your account into the onboarding flow. Each [Account Link](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_links) URL can only be used once because it grants access to the account holder’s personal information. Authenticate the account in your application before redirecting them to this URL.\n\nBefore creating the first account link for an Express connected account, prefill any [Know Your Customer](https://support.stripe.com/questions/know-your-customer) (KYC) information. After you create an account link for an Express connected account, you can’t read or update its KYC information.\n\n#### Security tip\n\nDon’t email, text, or otherwise send account link URLs outside of your platform application. Instead, provide them to the authenticated account holder within your application.\n\n[](#return-user)\n\nConnect Onboarding requires you to pass both a `return_url` and `refresh_url` to handle all cases where the connected account is redirected to your platform. It’s important that you implement these correctly to provide the best experience for your connected account.\n\n#### Note\n\nYou can use HTTP for your `return_url` and `refresh_url` while in test mode (for example, to test with localhost), but live mode only accepts HTTPS. Be sure to swap testing URLs for HTTPS URLs before going live.\n\n#### return\\_url![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nStripe issues a redirect to this URL when the connected account completes the Connect Onboarding flow. This doesn’t mean that all information has been collected or that there are no outstanding requirements on the account. This only means the flow was entered and exited properly.\n\nNo state is passed through this URL. After a connected account is redirected to your `return_url`, check the state of the `details_submitted` parameter on their account by doing either of the following:\n\n*   Listen to `account.updated` events with a [Connect webhook](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/webhooks).\n*   [Retrieve](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/retrieve) the account with the API.\n\n#### refresh\\_url![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYour connected account is redirected to the `refresh_url` in these cases:\n\n*   The link is expired (a few minutes passed after the link was created).\n*   They already visited the URL (they refreshed the page or clicked back or forward in the browser).\n*   Your platform can no longer access the account.\n*   The account has been rejected.\n\nSet up your `refresh_url` to trigger a method on your server to call [Account Links](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_links) again with the same parameters, and redirect the connected account to the Connect Onboarding flow to create a seamless experience.\n\n[\n\n## Handle connected accounts that have not completed onboarding![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n\n\n](#handle-users-not-completed-onboarding)\n\nA connected account that’s redirected to your `return_url` might not have completed the onboarding process. [Retrieve](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/retrieve) their account and check for `charges_enabled`. If the account isn’t fully onboarded, provide UI prompts to allow them to continue onboarding later.

    "markdown": "# Designing an integration | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Learn what choices you need to make to integrate subscriptions into your business.\n\nBefore you start building your [subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/creating \"subscriptions\") integration, you need to choose the right integration path, especially if you’re not writing the code yourself and need to collaborate with others. Use this guide to help you decide on the best way to build your integration, and follow the links to in-depth, step-by-step guides.\n\nThis guide is for users who aren’t necessarily writing code, but want to learn about the high-level subscription integration process so that they can create plans and organize resources.\n\nIf you already know how you’re going to build your integration, or if you want to start coding right away, see our [integration builder](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/quickstart).\n\n[](#subscription-models)\n\nYou need to understand the available subscription models to help you make later choices, such as which pricing model and payment form to use. First, consider your business model:\n\n*   If you want customers to pay, then provision access to your service, click the **pay up front** tab below to learn more.\n*   If you want to collect payment details, then offer customers a free trial period before billing them, click the **free trial** tab below to learn more.\n*   If you want to provide users access to your service without asking them for any payment information (a _freemium_ model), click the **freemium** tab below to learn more.\n\n![Pay-up-front subscription model](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/sub_model_pay_up_front.6b48054ef005d5ea359d56a3a07b6085.svg)\n\nPay-up-front model\n\nIn the pay-up-front model, you collect payment details and charge customers before provisioning access to your service. After the initial charge, you continue to charge customers the same fixed price for the same service at regular intervals. In this model, you use the Dashboard or [Subscriptions API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions) manage customer subscriptions. If you want to allow customers to modify their subscriptions directly, you need to integrate the [customer portal](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management).\n\nFor example, a photo hosting company that offers basic and premium service levels and charges customers on a monthly basis might have this setup:\n\n*   One product for the basic option\n*   One product for the premium option\n*   One price for the basic option (15 USD per month)\n*   One price for the premium option (25 USD per month)\n\nA typical flow for this model would look like the following:\n\n1.  The customer chooses their plan (basic or premium).\n2.  You collect payment information.\n3.  You provision access to your service. You know when to do this by monitoring [webhook events](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks).\n4.  You continue to provision access for customers throughout the lifecycle of the subscription. Check regularly to make sure you’re not providing access if a customer’s payment has failed.\n\nSee the [integration guide](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/build-subscriptions) to learn how to build an integration with a low-code approach that uses a prebuilt and hosted page from [Stripe Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout) or a custom version with [Stripe Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/elements).\n\n[](#collect-payment-info)\n\nIf you don’t want to write a lot of code, use [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout), Stripe’s prebuilt, hosted payment page. See the [subscriptions with Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/build-subscriptions?ui=stripe-hosted) integration guide to get started.\n\nIf you want a more customized payment form that you can embed into your existing website, use [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/elements), a set of prebuilt UI elements that’s part of [Stripe.js](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/elements).\n\n[](#pricing-table)\n\nEmbed a [pricing table](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/pricing-table) on your website to show customers pricing information for subscriptions. When customers choose a subscription option, they’re taken directly to checkout. Configure, customize, and update directly in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/pricing-tables) without writing any code.\n\n[](#modify-subs)\n\nIf you’re collecting payment information with Checkout, you can use the [customer portal](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management) to allow customers to directly update their subscription details, like payment method and frequency. See the [integration guide](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/build-subscriptions?ui=stripe-hosted) for detailed instructions on setting this up. (Before integrating, you should also be aware of the [limitations](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management) of the portal.)\n\nIf you’re integrating with Elements, you can add a form on the frontend to collect details about the plan they want to change (such as the price ID and their customer information) and send that to an endpoint on the backend. For more details and sample code, see the section about [letting customers change their plans](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/build-subscriptions?ui=elements#change-price) in the Elements quickstart.\n\n[](#pricing-models)\n\nIf you’re providing the same good every month and don’t expect that to change, use a simple fixed-price model. If the price varies depending on the number of users or units, you can use volume-based or tier-based prices. For a complete list of available models and a detailed description of each one, see [examples of pricing models](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/pricing-models).",

    "markdown": "# Debit connected accounts | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Collect funds from a connected account by debiting its Stripe balance.\n\nAt times, your platform might need to collect funds from your connected accounts:\n\n*   To charge the connected account directly for products or services\n*   To recover funds for a previous refund\n*   To make other adjustments to connected [account balances](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-balances) (for example, to correct an error)\n\nWhen creating and managing connected accounts where your platform is responsible for negative balances, including [Express](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/express-accounts) or [Custom](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom-accounts) accounts, you can debit a connected account’s Stripe balance, transferring funds to your platform balance.\n\n#### Note\n\nStripe supports two approaches for doing so:\n\n*   [Charging a connected account](#charging-a-connected-account) for your platform’s products or services\n*   [Transferring from a connected account](#transferring-from-a-connected-account) to recover funds or make other adjustments\n\nBoth approaches create the same flow of funds: a `Transfer` is created on the connected account and a `Payment` is created on the platform account.\n\n#### Caution\n\nUsing Account Debits requires getting legally binding consent from your connected accounts. This feature is available in Australia, Canada, Europe, Hong Kong, Japan, New Zealand, and the US. Stripe supports Account Debits only when both your platform and the connected account are in the same region (for example, both are in Japan). If you have interest in other regions, contact the [sales team](https://stripe.com/contact/sales). Using Account Debits incurs an [additional cost](https://stripe.com/connect/pricing).\n\n## Requirements![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThis functionality is only supported for connected accounts where your platform is responsible for negative balances, including [Express](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/express-accounts) and [Custom](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom-accounts) accounts. Additionally:\n\n*   The connected account and the platform must be in the same region (that is, both must be in Europe or in the US).\n*   The `currency` value must match the default currency of the connected account.\n*   Debiting an account can’t make the connected account balance become negative unless you have [reserves enabled](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-balances#understanding-connected-reserve-balances) (on by default for all new platforms created after January 31, 2017) and have a bank account in the same currency as the debit.\n*   If a connected account has a [negative balance](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-balances#accounting-for-negative-balances), Stripe might auto-debit the external account on file, depending on what country the connected account is in. If the external account [hasn’t been verified](https://stripe.com/resources/more/bank-account-verification-101), the debit can fail.\n\n## Charging a connected account![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe [create a charge](https://docs.stripe.com/api#create_charge) API call supports providing a connected account ID as the `source` value:\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/charges \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d amount=1500 \\  -d currency=usd \\  -d source=  {{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}    `\n\nThe API call returns the `Payment` created on the platform account (note: it does not return a `Charge`).\n\nThis approach is appropriate for platforms that charge their connected accounts for goods and services (that is, for using the platform). For example, a platform can charge its connected accounts for additional fees or services through their Stripe balance, minimizing any need to collect an additional payment method and allowing for nearly instant availability of the funds.\n\n## Transferring from a connected account![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe second method for debiting a connected account is to make a transfer from the connected account to your platform account. Use the `Stripe-Account` header to authenticate as the connected account and provide your platform’s Stripe account ID as the `destination`:\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/transfers \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -H \"Stripe-Account:   {{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}  \" \\  -d amount=1500 \\  -d currency=usd \\  -d destination={{PLATFORM_STRIPE_ACCOUNT_ID}}`\n\nThis API call returns the `Transfer` created on the connected account.\n\nThis approach is best for making adjustments within a platform (for example, correcting a payment mistake or recovering any fees you paid to Stripe).\n\n#### Note\n\nWhen you make this request, pass your platform’s Stripe account ID. You can find it on the [Business settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/account) page in your Dashboard. Its format is similar to `acct_1Nv0FGQ9RKHgCVdK`.\n\n## See also![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n*   [Creating Direct Charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges)\n*   [Creating Destination Charges on Your Platform](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges)\n*   [Creating Separate Charges and Transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)",

Meters are immutable, with the exception of the display name.\n\n#### Event name![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThis is the name of the meter event that you plan to record usage for with this meter. Use this name on the `event_name` field of the [Meter Event](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event/create) when you send usage to Stripe. This makes sure that the usage is ingested and aggregated by the correct meter. You can only use an event name with a single meter.\n\n#### Event ingestion![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nSpecify how you want to send events to Stripe. There are two options:\n\n*   **Raw**: Treat all meter events as standalone events. Multiple events sent for the same timestamp don’t overwrite each other and are included in the aggregation. This is the default option if nothing is specified.\n*   **Pre-aggregated (hourly or daily)**: If you’re sending events pre-aggregated over a specific time interval, either hourly or daily, Stripe only uses the most recent meter event within the hourly or daily window for aggregation. A newer event sent within the same hourly or daily window overwrites the previous one.\n\n#### Aggregation formula![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nSpecify how to aggregate the usage over the billing period. Options for that parameter include:\n\n*   **Sum**: Bill based on the sum of all usage values for the billing period.\n*   **Count**: Bill based on the count of all usage for the billing period.\n*   **Last (coming soon)**: Bill based on the most recent usage record for the billing period. If no usage is reported, the bill is based on a usage quantity of 0.\n*   **Max (coming soon)**: Bill based on the biggest value in the specified bucket of time (second, hour, day) within the billing period. For example, the max number of users who logged in during any day of the billing period, often referred to as “high watermark billing”\n\n#### Payload key overrides![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nSpecify which keys in the event payload refer to the customer and numerical usage values.\n\n*   **value\\_settings**: Define the key that refers to the numerical usage value in the payload of the meter event with this parameter. While the default key is `value`, you can specify a different key, such as tokens.\n*   **customer\\_mapping**: Define the key in the event payload that refers to the [Stripe Customer ID](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-id) with this parameter. Although the default key is `stripe_customer_id`, you can specify a different one, such as `customer_id`.\n\n### Event filtering Beta![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nEvent filtering allows you to define specific conditions under which meter events are included or discarded in the billing process. For example, you can filter out events where the API status code equals 500 so that these events aren’t billable. [Click here](#) if you’re interested in joining the beta.\n\n## Recording usage![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYou can share usage information with Stripe by creating meter events with a `customer_id`, a numerical value, and optionally a timestamp. How often you report usage is up to you. For example, you can send usage as it occurs or in batches (for example, every day). At the end of the billing period, Stripe automatically calculates the total price and invoices for all usage during the billing period.\n\nTo create [Meter Events](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event/create):\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/billing/meter_events \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d event_name=alpaca_ai_tokens \\  -d \"payload[value]\"=25 \\  -d \"payload[stripe_customer_id]\"={{CUSTOMER_ID}}`\n\n### Idempotency![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nUse [idempotency keys](https://docs.stripe.com/api/idempotent_requests) to prevent reporting usage more than one time due to latency or other issues. Every meter event corresponds to an [identifier](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event/create#create_billing_meter_event-identifier) that you can specify in your request (if you don’t specify it, we autogenerate one).\n\n### Event timestamps![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nMake sure that the timestamp falls within the past 35 calendar days and isn’t more than 5 minutes in the future (the 5-minute window accounts for clock drift between your server and Stripe’s systems).\n\n### Usage values![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe numerical usage value in the payload only accepts positive whole number values.\n\n#### Interested in using decimal or negative values?\n\n### Rate limits![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nBe mindful of the rate limit. The [Meter Events endpoint](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event/create) only allows 1000 calls per second per non-connect Stripe account in livemode, and one concurrent call per customer per meter. If your service might exceed this limit, you can “bundle” your product into amounts. For example, if you charge per 1000 requests, base your product on “per 1k transactions” and send 1 usage record every 1000 times.\n\nMonitor for `429` status codes and implement a retry mechanism with an exponential backoff schedule to manage request volume.\n\nAlso, consider incorporating some randomness into the backoff schedule to avoid a [thundering herd effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thundering_herd_problem).\n\n#### Note\n\nIf you’re a connect platform that is making requests on behalf of a connected account using the `Stripe-Account` header, you’re subject to [regular stripe rate limits](https://docs.stripe.com/rate-limits), which is 100 operations per second.\n\n#### Interested in higher rate limits?\n\n### Best practices![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nUsage data is crucial for accurate user billing. Make your system resilient to network failures. For example, use a reliable queue like Amazon SQS to push data to Stripe so you can retry if necessary.\n\n## Fix incorrect usage![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYou can cancel incorrectly reported events using the [Meter Event Adjustments](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_adjustment/create). You need an [identifier](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event/object#billing_meter_event_object-identifier) of the meter event to cancel it.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/billing/meter_event_adjustments \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d type=cancel \\  -d event_name=alpaca_ai_tokens \\  -d \"cancel[identifier]\"={{METER_EVENT_IDENTIFIER}}`\n\nCanceling meter events has the following limitations:\n\n*   You can only cancel events that have been sent to Stripe within the last 24 hours.\n*   We don’t support billing adjustments for canceled usage that we’ve already invoiced a customer for.\n*   If you cancel usage already included on a finalized invoice, we won’t update that invoice. Additionally, we won’t issue a new correction invoice for the canceled usage.",

Alpaca AI charges their users 0.04 USD per 1,000 tokens of consumption, billing at the end of the month in arrears.\n\n*   **Meter events**: You send customer-specific information, represented by meter events, to Stripe. These events represent the raw action a customer took in your system, forming the basis of their bill. In our example, this refers to the number of tokens a customer used in a query.\n*   **Meter**: Meters, as configuration objects for meter events, provide guidelines on how you want the meter events aggregated over the billing period. In this case, this refers to the sum of tokens over a month. Meters attach to prices, mapping the customer usage to customer subscriptions.\n*   **Meter event summary**: The event summary for a customer and meter returns aggregated usage for a period (the meter defines the aggregation formula). In our example, the meter event summary returns the sum() of tokens for a specific customer, meter, and time window. Meter events don’t become available on the read path and are asynchronously aggregated into Meter event summary results.\n*   **Prices**: Prices define the unit cost, currency, and billing cycle. In our example, you define a package price of 0.04 USD for 1000 tokens, billed at a monthly interval.

While they’re only supposed to be informational tools during the account application process, many entities refuse to accept businesses or individuals listed on a TMF. For this reason, it’s important to be aware of TMF criteria and make sure you avoid becoming eligible.\n\nThe most common list—and the only one with global reach—is Mastercard’s MATCH, or the Mastercard Alert to Control High-Risk Merchants. In the following sections, we describe how MATCH qualification works and what happens to MATCH entries.\n\n## Criteria for MATCH Qualification![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nWhen a relationship ends between a business and a credit card processor, the processor must determine whether the business meets criteria to be placed on MATCH.\n\nIf any MATCH criteria are satisfied, the processor must add information about the business to MATCH within one business day of termination or within one business day of the account becoming eligible for MATCH after termination.\n\n### Qualitative criteria![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe majority of MATCH criteria, or “reason codes,” involve breaches of card network rules, including illegal activity and collusion. These 11 reason codes, and the exact Mastercard definition, are listed below.\n\nThe Identity Theft reason code should be used when a fraudulent account is opened with stolen information, and the listing of this information on MATCH should not hamper the legitimate identity holder from opening a processing account. It instead serves as a warning to the credit card processor that the application may contain stolen identity information.\n\n| Code | Reason | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| #1  | Account Data Compromise | An occurrence that results, directly or indirectly, in the unauthorized access to or disclosure of Account data. |\n| #2  | Common Point of Purchase | Account data is stolen at the Merchant and then used for fraudulent purchases at other Merchant locations. |\n| #3  | Laundering | The Merchant was engaged in laundering activity. Laundering means that a Merchant presented to its Acquirer Transaction records that were not valid Transactions for sales of goods or services between that Merchant and a bona fide Cardholder. |\n| #7  | Fraud Conviction | There was a criminal fraud conviction of a principal owner or partner of the Merchant. |\n| #8  | Mastercard Questionable Merchant Audit Program | The Merchant was determined to be a Questionable Merchant as per the criteria set forth in the Mastercard Questionable Merchant Audit Program. |\n| #9  | Bankruptcy/Liquidation/Insolvency | The Merchant was unable or is likely to become unable to discharge its financial obligations. |\n| #10 | Violation of Standards | With respect to a Merchant reported by a Mastercard Acquirer, the Merchant was in violation of one or more Standards that describe procedures to be employed by the Merchant in Transactions in which Cards are used, including, by way of example and not limitation, the Standards for honoring all Cards, displaying the Marks, charges to Cardholders, minimum/ maximum Transaction amount restrictions, and prohibited Transactions set forth in Chapter 5 of the Mastercard Rules manual. |\n| #11 | Merchant Collusion | The Merchant participated in fraudulent collusive activity. |\n| #12 | PCIDSS Non-Compliance | The Merchant failed to comply with Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standard (DSS) requirements. |\n| #13 | Illegal Transactions | The Merchant was engaged in illegal Transactions. |\n| #14 | Identity Theft | The Acquirer has reason to believe that the identity of the listed Merchant or its principal owner(s) was unlawfully assumed for the purpose of unlawfully entering into a Merchant Agreement. |\n\n### Quantitative criteria![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nTwo MATCH reason codes have specific numeric thresholds defined by Mastercard for when processors must add accounts to MATCH.\n\nThese reason codes, which involve chargeback and fraud activity on an account, are the most common reasons for being added to MATCH, and can affect businesses that are not engaged in illegal or rule-violating activity. These reason codes are as follows:\n\n| Code | Reason | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| #4  | Excessive Chargebacks | With respect to a Merchant reported by a Mastercard Acquirer, the number of Mastercard chargebacks in any single month exceeded 1% of the number of Mastercard sales Transactions in that month, and those chargebacks totaled USD 5,000 or more. |\n| #5  | Excessive Fraud | The Merchant effected fraudulent Transactions of any type (counterfeit or otherwise) meeting or exceeding the following minimum reporting Standard: the Merchant’s fraud-to-sales dollar volume ratio was 8% or greater in a calendar month, and the Merchant effected 10 or more fraudulent Transactions totaling USD 5,000 or more in that calendar month. |\n\n## Additional information on excessive chargebacks and fraud![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThese MATCH reason codes are separate from card brand chargeback and fraud monitoring programs operated by Visa and Mastercard. However, as defined, the excessive chargebacks criteria only applies to activity on Mastercard cards, even though MATCH is required by all major card networks. If dispute activity does not take place on a Mastercard card, it would not qualify toward MATCH counts. Other card networks may ask for businesses to be listed on MATCH if those businesses hit the “excessive” stages of their card brand monitoring programs or are fined as part of those programs.\n\nA month is defined as a calendar month. For example, if a processor were evaluating MATCH eligibility from the month of January, they would look at the number of transactions in January and the number of chargebacks in January—not the number of chargebacks from transactions made in January.\n\nOnce a business meets the excessive chargebacks or fraud MATCH criteria in a calendar month, the merchant must be added to MATCH if the processing relationship is terminated, even if the processing relationship is not ended in that calendar month. For example, if a business only meets MATCH criteria in February, and the processing relationship is not ended until September, the processor is still required to add information to MATCH even though the qualifying activity took place in February. Additionally, even if a business does not meet MATCH criteria when the relationship is initially terminated, it can still qualify for MATCH if the criteria are met afterward—for example, if chargebacks are initiated after termination.\n\n### Example qualification data![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nTake the following sample data from a calendar month:\n\n*   Number of Mastercard transactions: 125\n*   Number of Mastercard chargebacks: 6\n*   Ratio of chargebacks to transactions: (6/125) = 4.8%\n*   Volume of Mastercard chargebacks: $6250\n\nIn this case, the business would qualify for MATCH for excessive chargebacks if the processing relationship later terminates. It does not matter if chargebacks are later reversed or won by the merchant.\n\nThere is no minimum number of chargebacks for MATCH qualification for excessive chargebacks.\n\n## Information added to MATCH![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe card networks require that the following information be added to MATCH if available:\n\n*   Business Legal Name and DBA\n*   Business Address\n*   Business Phone Number\n*   Business Tax ID\n*   Business URL\n*   Principal Owner Name\n*   Principal Owner Address\n*   Principal Owner Phone Number\n*   Principal Owner Tax ID\n*   Account Opening Date and Termination Date\n*   MATCH Reason Code\n\nMastercard does not assess the accuracy of MATCH listings.\n\n## Removal from MATCH![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nUnfortunately, Stripe—or any other processor—usually cannot remove an account’s information from MATCH upon request. A processor can only remove a MATCH entry if:\n\n*   The processor added the business to MATCH in error.\n*   The listing is for MATCH reason code 12 (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard Noncompliance) and the processor has confirmed that the business has become compliant with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard.\n\nIf you believe either of those two situations exist, you’ll need to reach out to the processor that listed your information on MATCH to be removed. Records remain on the MATCH system for five years before being automatically purged by Mastercard.\n\n## Next steps if you are listed on MATCH![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nIf you’re listed on MATCH, you’re likely to find out when you attempt to sign up for a new processor. MATCH is only supposed to be used as an informational tool by processors during the application process; however, the presence of a MATCH listing often means that an application is declined.\n\nYou’ll need to reach out to your previous processor to find out why your information was added to MATCH. Note, however, that MATCH criteria are determined by Mastercard and processors are required to follow this criteria. Stripe cannot remove a merchant that met the “excessive chargebacks” criteria even if the business has remediated the issues leading to chargebacks, for example.\n\nDue to banking partner restrictions, Stripe generally cannot process for businesses listed on MATCH unless extenuating circumstances apply, such as the case of a legitimate merchant who previously had their identity information stolen.\n\nIf you require assistance with a dispute, [contact Stripe support](https://support.stripe.com/contact).",

The disputed funds are taken from their balance, not the platform’s.\n\nFor connected accounts where your platform is [liable for negative balances](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/risk-management \"negative balance liability\") (including Custom and Express accounts), you’re ultimately responsible for any disputes involving those accounts.\n\nFor direct payments on connected accounts where your platform is liable for negative balances, Stripe debits disputed amounts and fees from that account’s balance. However, your platform account is ultimately liable. If Stripe can’t debit the disputed amount and fee from the connected account, Stripe debits it from the platform account.\n\nFor [destination charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges) and [separate charges and transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers), with or without `on_behalf_of`, Stripe debits dispute amounts and fees from the platform account. When that happens, the platform can attempt to recover funds from the connected account by reversing the transfer through the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/transfers) or by [creating a transfer reversal](https://docs.stripe.com/api#create_transfer_reversal).\n\nIf there is a negative balance on the connected account, Stripe attempts to debit its card issuer account only if `debit_negative_balances` is set to `true`.\n\nIn case of a won dispute, your platform might want to transfer the funds back to the connected account because the transfer was reversed earlier. If your platform has an insufficient balance, the transfer fails.

    "markdown": "# Dispute and fraud card monitoring programs\n\n## Learn about the monitoring programs operated by the card networks, and what you should do if you're placed into one.\n\nAs part of your financial obligations to the card networks, you must keep [disputes](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes) (also called chargebacks) and fraud at acceptable levels. If they exceed the thresholds dictated by a network (for example, [Visa](#visa-programs) or [Mastercard](#mastercard-programs)), the network places you into one of their monitoring programs. As part of a program, you can incur monthly fines and additional fees until you reduce your dispute or fraud levels in a sustained way.\n\nStripe can work with you on a remediation plan to reduce the levels of disputes or fraud related to your account. We also communicate directly with the networks and relay information on a monthly basis. Download our [remediation template](https://stripe.com/files/compliance/monitoring_program_remediation_template.pdf) to get started.\n\nWhile monitoring programs are comparatively rare, take them seriously. If you’re identified into one, you must take immediate action to address the situation. Failure to comply with the requirements of a program within the specified time period, or timeline, can result in the network refusing to process further payments to you. That can put your ability to accept any credit card payments [at risk](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/match#quantitative-criteria).\n\n#### Note\n\nThis page is a general guide for Stripe users, not a comprehensive reference for card network monitoring programs. For complete and up to date information about monitoring programs, see the documentation provided by the networks.\n\n## Understanding disputes and chargebacks![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nFor the purposes of monitoring programs, a dispute or chargeback occurs when funds move out of an account due to a disputed payment, regardless of the reason. The terms “dispute” and “chargeback” are interchangeable. The Visa monitoring program refers to disputes, while the Mastercard and AusPayNet monitoring programs refer to chargebacks.\n\nMonitoring programs don’t consider refunds when identifying disputes. In some cases, if you issued a full refund at least 10 days before a dispute, we can ask to have the dispute removed from the account. The issuer might have missed the refund and raised the dispute by mistake, but that rarely happens.\n\nSimilarly, monitoring programs don’t consider dispute outcomes. If they did, they’d have to wait for the outcome of every dispute, which can take months, before including it in their calculations. They’re also more interested in how successfully you prevent disputes than in whether you win them.\n\nSome disputes where you have no liability don’t appear in your Dashboard or API responses because Stripe handles them on your behalf. They don’t count toward your Stripe dispute or fraud rates, and we don’t charge you for them. However, monitoring programs still include them in their calculations. That can create a discrepancy between your data and the dispute rates that the networks calculate for you, especially if you issue a lot of refunds. For example:\n\n*   You refunded the payment before the customer submitted the dispute.\n*   The dispute duplicates a previously resolved dispute.\n*   The card network created or processed the dispute in error.\n\nIn some cases, the data reported to Stripe by the card networks doesn’t match the data visible in your Dashboard. It can happen because of discrepancies or formatting issues in your statement descriptors, having multiple Merchant IDs (MIDs), or double-counted charges. If Stripe updates your MID during a month, it can affect your Mastercard data. If you think a card network made a calculation error, contact [Stripe support](https://support.stripe.com/).\n\nThe following scenarios don’t count as disputes:\n\n*   Unescalated [inquiries](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/how-disputes-work#inquiries), where a card issuer begins an investigation but never returns the disputed payment.\n*   [Early fraud warnings](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/how-disputes-work#early-fraud-warnings) (EFWs), which are informational messages from card network reports about suspected fraud. Although they don’t count as disputes, they do count as fraud, regardless of their outcome, and Visa’s [VFMP](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/monitoring-programs#vfmp) program includes them in its calculations.\n*   Non-disputed funds that move through a card network’s dispute system. Such movement can occur as part of Visa’s [Rapid Dispute Resolution](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/how-disputes-work#responding-to-a-dispute) program.\n\n## Monitoring program calendars![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nVisa and Mastercard monitoring programs track activity by month, while the AusPayNet monitoring program tracks activity by quarter.\n\nVisa and Mastercard programs calculate monthly rates differently. Visa calculates the ratio of disputes or fraud to the total number of payments in the same calendar month. Mastercard calculates the ratio of disputes or fraud to the total number of payments in the previous month. Both networks assign a dispute or fraud report to the month in which they received it, regardless of when the original payment occurred.\n\nVisa and Mastercard monitoring programs use specific nomenclature to refer to their monthly rate calculations:\n\nA “data month” is the month in which a network receives a dispute or fraud report. Mastercard refers to two different data months, one for disputes and the other for sales.\n\nA “report month,” “reporting month,” or “identification month” is the month in which a program identifies a business based on its data meeting a threshold. It’s usually the month after the data month containing that data.\n\n## Estimate your dispute or fraud rate![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nIf you have [Stripe Sigma](https://stripe.com/sigma) or [Data Pipeline](https://stripe.com/data-pipeline), you can use it to [track your estimated dispute or fraud rate for a given monitoring program](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-data/query-disputes-and-fraud-data#tracking-monitoring-programs). We offer [a guide to help you implement a continuous fraud management process](https://stripe.com/guides/improve-fraud-management-with-radar-for-fraud-teams-and-stripe-data) using those tools.\n\nIf you don’t have either of those products, you can manually estimate your dispute rate. Export your Visa or Mastercard disputes from the **Payments** tab in your Dashboard and compare them to your payments according to a program’s formula. For accounts outside the US, count payments and disputes for a calendar month. For accounts in the US, there’s a delay between receiving disputes from our financial partner and reporting them to the card network. To account for that delay, count payments for a calendar month, and count disputes from the 5th of that month to the 5th of the following month.\n\nYou can also track EFWs using the [Early Fraud Warnings](https://docs.stripe.com/api/radar/early_fraud_warnings) API. In addition, when we receive a fraud report for a payment that hasn’t already been disputed or refunded, we send a notification to the primary email on your account.\n\n## Visa monitoring programs ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nThe [Visa Fraud Monitoring Program](#vfmp) (VFMP) and [Visa Dispute Monitoring Program](#vdmp) (VDMP) apply to businesses in all of our supported countries. The VFMP 3DS (for [3D-Secure transactions](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure)) and VFMP Digital Goods (for merchants selling digital goods) programs are additional fraud programs enforced by Visa. Like VFMP and VDMP, VFMP Digital Goods is a global program, while VFMP 3DS only applies to businesses based in the US.\n\nAt the beginning of each month, Visa reviews your previous month’s activity to see if it has exceeded any of their established thresholds. If so, Stripe contacts you. When Visa identifies you into a program, it triggers a 12-month timeline. If you don’t exit the program before the timeline ends, you can lose your ability to accept Visa payments.\n\nFor users in the US, Europe, Canada, Australia, and Brazil, both domestic and cross-border activity count toward monthly totals. For users outside of those regions, only cross-border activity is counted.\n\nVisa identifies an account by the static component of its [statement descriptor](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/statement-descriptors) and its acquiring bank, which usually varies by country. For this purpose, Visa treats the EU as a single country. For example, consider an account that uses one statement descriptor in Canada and a second statement descriptor in both Canada and the US. If the individual dispute rates for all three combinations exceed a program’s threshold, a Visa program can identify that account three times, one time for each descriptor in each country. However, for an account that uses the same statement descriptor in Ireland, France, and Germany, a Visa program can only identify that account one time because Visa aggregates its EU volume.\n\nIf you use multiple statement descriptors and want Visa to aggregate their dispute and fraud rates, give each descriptor the same static prefix. If you change your descriptors to use matching prefixes, ask Stripe to contact Visa and request that they aggregate your transactions. Make the change at the end of a month so it doesn’t affect the rate calculations for that month.\n\n### Early warning notifications ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nVisa operates an early warning system through Stripe that warns users who are at risk of being placed into a monitoring program. Users who meet the early warning threshold aren’t immediately placed into the program. Instead, they’re given the opportunity to avoid the program by reducing the level of fraud on their account.\n\nIf you receive an early warning from Visa, try to reduce your fraud rate. If your rate continues to rise, Visa eventually places you in a monitoring program.\n\n#### Note\n\nEarly warning notifications might not occur for accounts that reach a program’s standard or excessive threshold immediately after meeting its early warning threshold.\n\n### Remediation ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nVisa removes you from a program when your level of disputes or fraud drops below the standard threshold for 3 consecutive months, even if you’re at the excessive level. If you reach a program’s excessive threshold, excessive penalties apply until you exit the program entirely. Dropping below the excessive threshold doesn’t reduce your penalties to the standard level.\n\n#### Note\n\nDropping below the threshold doesn’t reset your timeline. If you remain below the threshold for 1 or 2 months, then reach it again, your original timeline resumes. That means that if 10 months pass without exiting a program, exceeding the threshold in any month prevents you from exiting before the end of the timeline.\n\nMonitoring your dispute and fraud levels accurately is important. For example, Visa counts disputes regardless of whether the dispute was hidden due to a refund, regardless of liability shift, and regardless of whether you won the dispute.\n\nAs part of the remediation process, Stripe can require you to provide details on the steps you’re taking and your timeline for implementing them.\n\n### VDMP: Visa Dispute Monitoring Program ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nVDMP applies to users with an unusually high level of disputed payments on their account. Users are placed into this program if they meet or exceed the monthly thresholds for both of the following criteria:\n\n*   The total number of payment disputes (dispute count)\n*   The ratio of disputed payments to all captured payments ([dispute rate](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/measuring#dispute-rate-usage))\n\nA payment dispute belongs to the month in which it’s raised, not the month when the original payment was captured. For example, calculations for February include payments captured in February and disputes raised in February, even if the payments being disputed were captured in January. The February calculations don’t consider any payments captured in January.\n\n| Dispute Count | Dispute Rate | Fines |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 75  | 0.65% | None. You have the opportunity to take action that reduces your dispute level before it exceeds a threshold where fines are incurred. |\n\nYou might not receive an early warning notification if you reach the standard or excessive threshold immediately after reaching the early warning threshold.\n\n### VFMP: Visa Fraud Monitoring Program ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nVFMP applies to users with an excessive level of fraud on their account, which Visa calculates using [early fraud warning (EFW)](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/how-disputes-work#early-fraud-warnings) data sourced from their TC40 reporting. Users are placed into this program if they meet or exceed the monthly thresholds for both of the following criteria:\n\n*   The total USD volume of EFWs (Fraud Volume)\n*   The ratio of the USD volume of EFWs to the USD volume of all captured payments (Fraud Rate)\n\nAn EFW belongs to the month in which the TC40 was reported, not the month when the reported payment was captured. For example, calculations for February include payments captured in February and EFWs reported in February, even if the potentially fraudulent payments were captured in January. The February calculations don’t consider any payments captured in January.\n\n| Fraud Volume | Fraud Rate | Fines |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 50,000 USD | 0.65% | None. You can take action that reduces your fraud level before it incurs penalties. |\n\nYou might not receive an early warning notification if you reach the standard or excessive threshold immediately after reaching the early warning threshold.\n\n### VFMP: Visa Fraud Monitoring Program-3DS (US-only) ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nVFMP-3DS applies only to US-based users with US-based custom accounts and an excessive level of fraud on domestic Visa 3D-Secure-authenticated (3DS) transactions on US-issued cards.\n\n#### Note\n\nBy default, Stripe allows all authenticated 3DS payments to go through. You can adjust your rules to block 3DS payments that are flagged as high risk. You can also consider other signals that usually apply to normal charges, such as velocity, transaction size, and CVC/AVS checks.\n\nVisa calculates the fraud level using [early fraud warning (EFW)](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/how-disputes-work#early-fraud-warnings) data sourced from their TC40 reporting. Users are placed into this program if they meet or exceed the monthly thresholds for both of the following criteria:\n\n*   The total USD volume of EFWs for Visa 3DS-authenticated payments (Fraud Volume)\n*   The ratio of the USD volume of EFWs for Visa 3DS-authenticated payments to the USD volume of all captured Visa 3DS-authenticated payments (Fraud Rate)\n\nAn EFW belongs to the month in which the TC40 was reported, not the month when the reported payment was captured. For example, calculations for February include 3DS-authenticated payments captured in February and EFWs reported in February for 3DS-authenticated payments, even if the potentially fraudulent payments were captured in January. The February calculations don’t consider any payments captured in January.\n\n| Fraud Volume | Fraud Rate | Fines |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 50,000 USD | 0.50% | None. You have the opportunity to take action that reduces your fraud level before it exceeds a threshold where penalties are incurred. |\n\nYou might not receive an early warning notification if you reach the standard threshold immediately after reaching the early warning threshold.\n\n### VFMP: Visa Fraud Monitoring Program (digital goods merchants) ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nThe VFMP for digital goods merchants applies to small ticket and digital goods merchants with excessive levels of fraud on their account. Visa calculates the fraud level using [early fraud warning (EFW)](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/how-disputes-work#early-fraud-warnings) data sourced from their TC40 reporting. The VFMP for digital goods merchants applies to businesses with the following MCCs:\n\n*   5735 — Record Stores\n*   5815 — Digital Goods Media — Books, Movies, Digital artwork/images, Music\n*   5816 — Digital Goods — Games\n*   5817 — Digital Goods — Applications (Excludes Games)\n*   5818 — Digital Goods — Large Digital Goods Merchant\n\nUsers are placed into this program if they meet or exceed the monthly thresholds for all of the following criteria:\n\n*   The total USD volume of EFWs for relevant payments (Fraud volume)\n*   The total count of EFWs for relevant payments (Fraud count)\n*   The ratio of the USD volume of EFWs for relevant payments to the USD volume of all captured relevant payments (Fraud Rate)\n\nAn EFW belongs to the month in which the TC40 was reported, not the month when the reported payment was captured. For example, calculations for February include relevant payments captured in February and EFWs reported in February for relevant payments, even if the potentially fraudulent payments were captured in January. The February calculations don’t consider any payments captured in January.\n\n| Fraud volume | Fraud count | Fraud rate | Fines |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 15,000 USD | 150 | 0.45% | None. You have the opportunity to take action that reduces your fraud level before it exceeds a threshold where penalties are incurred. |\n\n## Mastercard monitoring programs ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nMastercard’s Excessive Chargeback Program (ECP) consists of two levels: [Excessive Chargeback Merchant (ECM)](#ecm) and [High Excessive Chargeback Merchant (HECM)](#hecm), and it applies to users in all supported countries. The [Excessive Fraud Merchant (EFM) Compliance Program](#efm) is a separate program that applies to users in all supported countries besides Germany, India, and Switzerland.\n\nIf your account exceeds program thresholds, Mastercard places you into that program and Stripe notifies you. If you exceed both EFM and ECP thresholds, you’re placed in EFM but not ECP. However, Mastercard tracks both thresholds. For example, you exceed EFM and ECP thresholds in March and April, but exceed only ECP thresholds in May. In April, you’re placed in month 2 of EFM and fined accordingly. In May, you’re placed in month 3 of ECP despite the EFM identifications taking precedence in prior months.\n\n### Remediation ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nMastercard removes you from a program when your chargebacks drop below the program threshold for 3 consecutive months. If you’re in HECM, and your chargebacks drop below the HECM threshold but still meet the ECM threshold, you move to the ECM level.\n\nMonitoring your chargeback and fraud levels accurately is important. For example, Mastercard counts a chargeback regardless of whether it was hidden due to a refund, regardless of liability shift, and regardless of its outcome.\n\nAs part of the remediation process, Stripe can require you to provide details on the steps you’re taking and your timeline for implementing them.\n\n### ECP: Mastercard Excessive Chargeback Program ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nUsers are placed into ECP if they meet or exceed the monthly thresholds for both of the following criteria:\n\n*   The total number of payment chargebacks (chargeback count)\n*   The ratio of the chargeback count for the current month to the total number of captured payments from the preceding month ([chargeback rate](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/measuring#dispute-rate-usage))\n\nA payment chargeback belongs to the month in which it’s raised, not the month when the original payment was captured. For example, calculations for February use payments captured in January and chargebacks raised in February, including chargebacks for payments captured in February.\n\n### ECM: Mastercard Excessive Chargeback Merchant ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\n| Dispute Count | Chargeback Rate | Fines |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 100-299 | 1.5-2.99% | Fines begin in month two and continue at increasing rates in subsequent months. See the timeline below for details. |\n\n| Number of months above ECM thresholds | Fine | Issuer recovery assessment |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1   | 0 USD | No  |\n| 2   | 1,000 USD | No  |\n| 3   | 2,000 USD | No  |\n| 4-6 | 5,000 USD | Yes |\n| 7-11 | 25,000 USD | Yes |\n| 12-18 | 50,000 USD | Yes |\n| 19+ | 100,000 USD | Yes |\n\nIssuer recovery assessment applies an additional 5 USD per chargeback fee for each chargeback over 300 chargebacks. For example, a merchant identified in month 4 of ECM with 400 disputes is assessed a 5,500 USD fine (5,000 USD + (400-300) x 5 USD).\n\n### HECM: Mastercard High Excessive Chargeback Merchant ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\n| Dispute Count | Chargeback Rate | Fines |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 300+ | 3%  | Fines begin in month two and continue at increasing rates in subsequent months. See the timeline below for details. |\n\n| Number of months above ECM thresholds | Fine | Issuer recovery assessment |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1   | 0 USD | No  |\n| 2   | 1,000 USD | No  |\n| 3   | 2,000 USD | No  |\n| 4-6 | 10,000 USD | Yes |\n| 7-11 | 50,000 USD | Yes |\n| 12-18 | 100,000 USD | Yes |\n| 19+ | 200,000 USD | Yes |\n\nMastercard communicates total fine amounts to merchants through Stripe.\n\n### EFM: Mastercard Excessive Fraud Merchant Compliance Program ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nUsers are placed into EFM if they meet or exceed the monthly thresholds for all of the following criteria:\n\n*   Number of e-commerce Mastercard payments\n*   The total USD volume of fraud-related chargebacks (net fraud volume) with dispute reason code 4837 or 4863\n*   The ratio of the number of fraud-related chargebacks in the current month to the number of e-commerce transactions in the preceding month (fraud chargeback rate)\n*   The percentage of Mastercard payments that use 3-D Secure (3DS)\n\nThe fraud chargeback rate uses a similar calculation to the chargeback rate for ECP, but it considers only fraud-related chargebacks.\n\nEFM applies to users who meet all of the following conditions:\n\n*   Minimum of 1,000 e-commerce Mastercard payments\n*   Net fraud volume is greater than 50,000 USD (15,000 USD for Australia)\n*   Fraud chargeback rate is greater than 0.50% (0.20% for Australia)\n*   Total 3DS Mastercard payment count is less than or equal to:\n    *   10% of total Mastercard payment count (non-regulated countries)\n    *   50% of total Mastercard payment count (regulated countries)\n\n| Number of months above ECM thresholds | Fine |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1   | 0 USD |\n| 2   | 500 USD |\n| 3   | 1,000 USD |\n| 4-6 | 5,000 USD |\n| 7-11 | 25,000 USD |\n| 12-18 | 50,000 USD |\n| 19+ | 100,000 USD |\n\nYou can request that Mastercard suspend an assessed fine one time during an open case. However, only do so if you’re confident that you’ll be below the threshold to exit the program for the next 3 months. If you request a suspension of fines and fall below the threshold for 2 months, but exceed it in the following month, fine assessments continue until you exit the program.\n\n## AusPayNet monitoring programs ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nThe AusPayNet (APN) Card-Not-Present (CNP) fraud mitigation program is designed to reduce CNP payments fraud within the Australian payment industry (AU-based users and cardholders only). Where user fraud rates exceed certain defined thresholds for two consecutive quarters, the APN reserves the option to mandate [Strong Customer Authentication (SCA)](#sca) for all transactions. Stripe notifies you if your account exceeds program thresholds for the preceding quarter.\n\n### FMP: APN Fraud Monitoring Program ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nUsers who meet or exceed both the following criteria thresholds are placed into FMP:\n\n*   **Fraud chargeback amount**: Total value (in AUD) of fraudulent chargebacks received in the quarter is greater than 50,000 AUD.\n*   **Fraud-to-sales ratio**: The ratio of fraud chargeback amount to sales value in the quarter is greater than or equal to 0.20%\n\n#### Note\n\nAPN excludes card-present and 3DS authenticated payment transactions in these threshold computations.\n\n| Number of quarters above FMP thresholds | Remediation measures |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1   | You must implement fraud controls to reduce fraudulent chargebacks. We recommend performing [SCA](#sca) on a subset of CNP transactions that you define as high risk. |\n| 2   | You must do one or more of the following:<br><br>*   Perform risk based SCA (as above)<br>*   Use SCA on all CNP transaction (excluding [SCA exempted transactions](#sca-exemptions))<br>*   Introduce more sensitive or effective fraud controls |\n| 3   | You must pass all CNP transactions through to the cardholder’s issuing bank for SCA. Failure to do so might result in off-boarding. |\n| 4+  | You might be off-boarded. |\n\nWhen your CNP transactions fall below the threshold criteria for FMP for one quarter, APN releases you from the FMP and SCA obligations.\n\n### SCA: Strong Customer Authentication ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nSCA is an authentication method in which you verify cardholder’s identity using at least two of the following factors:\n\n*   Knowledge factor: something only the cardholder knows, for example a password\n*   Possession factor: something only the cardholder possess, for example a mobile phone\n*   Inherence factor: something the cardholder is, for example fingerprint or facial recognition\n\n### SCA exemptions ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nAPN exempts the following types of transactions from the SCA requirement:\n\n*   Recurring transactions: Series of repeated transactions with SCA applied on the first charge of the recurring series\n*   Trusted customer transactions: Transactions where you have previously identified/authenticated the cardholder and the cardholder uses the same card on file with matching identifiers\n*   Wallet transactions: Digital or mobile wallet transactions where the cardholder identity has been verified and each subsequent transaction is authorized by the cardholder using biometrics or a passcode\n\n## Best practices for preventing fraud and disputes![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nFollowing these guidelines can help you avoid being placed into card network monitoring programs.\n\n### Prevent identifiable fraud![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nConsider using separate authorization and capture in combination with review rules. Issuers are required to report possible fraud for a captured payment, even if it gets refunded, but aren’t required to report it for a payment authorization. If you identify and reverse a fraudulent or suspicious payment authorization before it’s captured, it isn’t reported.\n\n### Prevent disputes for canceled subscriptions![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n*   Offer a quick and easy way to cancel. An in-app cancellation button is often the best solution, because it doesn’t require the cardholder to wait to confirm their refund.\n*   Clearly communicate billing terms up front prior to accepting cardholder information.\n*   Require the cardholder to click a button that confirms their agreement to the billing terms.\n*   If offering a free or discounted trial, send a reminder before it expires allowing the cardholder an opportunity to cancel.\n*   Implement a flexible refund or return policy. For example, if a user cancels the day after being billed, offer a full or prorated refund.\n*   Send billing reminders, especially if on a yearly [subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/creating \"subscriptions\"). Typically 7 days before a yearly renewal and 2 to 3 days before a monthly renewal.\n*   Third party solutions, such as Ethoca and Verifi. These companies work with certain issuers so that an alert is raised when a chargeback is about to be initiated, allowing the user an opportunity to refund.\n\n### Prevent disputes for unreceived products![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n*   Clearly communicate shipping times prior to checkout.\n*   Clearly and quickly communicate any shipping delays and offer an option for the cardholder to receive a refund if they don’t want to wait.\n*   Ship items quickly and provide the cardholder with a tracking number when the item has been shipped.\n*   For higher value goods, require a signature upon delivery to prevent missing packages or potential “friendly fraud.”\n*   Make sure items are well stocked and either indicate when an item is backordered or remove it from the site.\n\n### Prevent disputes for unacceptable products![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n*   Implement a flexible refund policy and issue them under reasonable circumstances.\n*   Clearly describe the items being sold and display accurate images when possible.\n*   Reevaluate any products which tend to see higher dispute rates for these reasons. It’s possible the items could be defective.\n*   Clearly display the full price of the item, including any taxes, and make sure to present it to the cardholder before accepting their payment information.\n\n### Prevent “friendly fraud” disputes![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nA [friendly fraud](https://stripe.com/resources/more/what-is-friendly-fraud) dispute occurs when a customer disputes a legitimate charge that they believe to be fraudulent. The best way to prevent such disputes is to collect as much information as possible when capturing a payment. For example, clearly communicate billing terms and shipping times, require the cardholder to agree to the terms of service, ship only to verified addresses, or require a signature upon delivery.\n\n### Prevent other types of disputes![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nLess common disputes, such as `general` or `duplicate`, can indicate things like an unrecognized statement descriptor or a confusing billing statement. Normally, such disputes make up a small percentage of the total. However, if you find any of them to be very common, it could indicate some other issue at the root of the problem. For example, a large number of `general` disputes can result from poorly designed receipts that make customers question the amounts they were charged.",

Pass the client secret to the client-side application to continue with the setup process.\n\n[](#web-collect-payment-method-details)\n\nYou’re ready to collect payment information on the client with [Stripe Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/elements). Elements is a set of prebuilt UI components for collecting payment details.\n\nA Stripe Element contains an iframe that securely sends the payment information to Stripe over an HTTPS connection. The checkout page address must also start with https:// rather than http:// for your integration to work.\n\nYou can test your integration without using HTTPS. [Enable it](https://docs.stripe.com/security/guide#tls) when you’re ready to accept live payments.\n\n### Set up Stripe Elements![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nStripe Elements is automatically available as a feature of Stripe.js. Include the Stripe.js script on your payment page by adding it to the `head` of your HTML file. Always load Stripe.js directly from js.stripe.com to remain PCI compliant. Don’t include the script in a bundle or host a copy of it yourself.\n\nCreate an instance of [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/js#stripe-elements) with the following JavaScript on your payment page:\n\n`const stripe = Stripe(`\n\n`'pk_test_TYooMQauvdEDq54NiTphI7jx'`\n\n`); const elements = stripe.elements();`\n\n### Direct Debit Requests![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nBefore you can create a BECS Direct Debit payment, your customer must agree with the Direct Debit Request Service Agreement. They do so by submitting a completed Direct Debit Request (DDR). The approval gives you a mandate to debit their account. The `Mandate` is a record of the permission to debit a payment method.\n\nFor online mandate acceptance, you can create a form to collect the necessary information. Serve the form over [HTTPS](https://docs.stripe.com/security/guide#tls) and capture the following information:\n\n| Information | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Account name** | The full name of the account holder |\n| **BSB number** | The Bank-State-Branch number of the bank account (for example, `123-456`) |\n| **Account number** | The bank account number (for example, `87654321`) |\n\nWhen collecting a Direct Debit Request, follow our [BECS Direct Debit Terms](https://stripe.com/au-becs/legal) and as part of your checkout form:\n\n*   Display the exact terms of [Stripe’s DDR service agreement](https://stripe.com/au-becs-dd-service-agreement/legal) either inline on the form, or on a page linked from the form, and identifying it as the “DDR service agreement.”\n*   Make sure the accepted DDR and its accompanying [DDR service agreement](https://stripe.com/au-becs-dd-service-agreement/legal) can be shared with your customer at all times, either as a printed or non-changeable electronic copy (such as email). Stripe hosts this for you.\n*   Display the following standard authorization text for your customer to accept the BECS DDR, where you replace _Rocketship Inc_ with your company name. Their acceptance authorizes you to initiate BECS Direct Debit payments from their bank account.\n\n#### Note\n\nBy providing your bank account details, you agree to this Direct Debit Request and the [Direct Debit Request service agreement](https://stripe.com/au-becs-dd-service-agreement/legal), and authorize Stripe Payments Australia Pty Ltd ACN 160 180 343 Direct Debit User ID number 507156 (“Stripe”) to debit your account through the Bulk Electronic Clearing System (BECS) on behalf of _Rocketship Inc_ (the “Merchant”) for any amounts separately communicated to you by the Merchant. You certify that you’re either an account holder or an authorized signatory on the account listed above.\n\nThe details of the accepted mandate are generated when setting up a [PaymentMethod](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods) or confirming a `PaymentIntent`. At all times, you should be able to share this mandate—the accepted DDR and its accompanying DDR service agreement—with your customer, either in print or as a non-changeable electronic copy (such as email). Stripe hosts this for you under the `url` property of the `Mandate` object linked to the `PaymentMethod`.\n\n### Add and configure an Australia Bank Account Element![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe Australia Bank Account Element will help you collect and validate both the BSB number and the account number. It needs a place to live in your payment form. Create empty DOM nodes (containers) with unique IDs in your payment form.

This is different from your API keys that authenticate Stripe API requests.\n\nThe client secret should be handled carefully because it can complete the setup. Do not log it, embed it in URLs, or expose it to anyone but the customer.\n\nUse [stripe.confirmAuBecsDebitSetup](https://docs.stripe.com/js/setup_intents/confirm_au_becs_debit_setup) to complete the setup when the user submits the form. A successful setup returns a `succeeded` value for the SetupIntent’s `status` property. If the setup isn’t successful, inspect the returned `error` to determine the cause.\n\nAs [customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_intents/create#create_setup_intent-customer) was set, the [PaymentMethod](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods \"PaymentMethods\") is attached to the provided `Customer` object after a successful setup. At this point, you can associate the ID of the `Customer` object with your internal representation of a customer. This allows you to use the stored `PaymentMethod` to collect future payments without prompting for your customer’s payment method details.\n\n`const form = document.getElementById('setup-form'); const accountholderName = document.getElementById('accountholder-name'); const email = document.getElementById('email'); const submitButton = document.getElementById('submit-button'); const clientSecret = submitButton.dataset.secret;  form.addEventListener('submit', async (event) => {   event.preventDefault();   stripe.confirmAuBecsDebitSetup(     clientSecret,     {       payment_method: {         au_becs_debit: auBankAccount,         billing_details: {           name: accountholderName.value,           email: email.value         }       }     }   ); });`\n\nAfter successfully confirming the `SetupIntent`, you should share the [mandate URL](https://docs.stripe.com/api/mandates/object#mandate_object-payment_method_details-au_becs_debit-url) from the [Mandate object](https://docs.stripe.com/api/mandates) with your customer. We also recommend including the following details to your customer when you confirm their mandate has been established:\n\n*   an explicit confirmation message that indicates a Direct Debit arrangement has been set up\n*   the [business name](#statement-descriptors) that will appear on the customer’s bank statement whenever their account gets debited\n*   the payment amount and schedule (if applicable)\n*   a link to the generated DDR mandate URL\n\nThe `Mandate` object’s ID is accessible from the `mandate` on the SetupIntent object, which is sent as part of the `setup_intent.succeeded` event sent after confirmation, but can also be [retrieved through the API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_intents/retrieve).\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/setup_intents/{{SETUP_INTENT_ID}} \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d \"expand[]\"=mandate`\n\n[](#web-test-integration)\n\nYou can test your form using the test BSB number `000-000` and one of the test account numbers below with your [confirmAuBecsDebitSetup](https://docs.stripe.com/js/setup_intents/confirm_au_becs_debit_setup) request.\n\n| BSB Number | Account Number | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `000-000` | `000123456` | The PaymentIntent created with the resulting PaymentMethod transitions from `processing` to `succeeded`.

    "markdown": "# The Sources API | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## The Sources APIDeprecated\n\n## Learn about the different payment methods and mechanisms available through the Sources API.\n\n#### Warning\n\nWe deprecated the Sources API and plan to remove support for local payment methods. If you currently handle any local payment methods using the Sources API, you must [migrate them to the Payment Methods API](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/transitioning). We’ll send email communication with more information about this end of support.\n\nWhile we don’t plan to remove support for card payments, we recommend replacing any use of the Sources API with the [PaymentMethods API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods), which provides access to our latest features and payment method types.\n\n[Source](https://docs.stripe.com/api#sources) objects allow you to accept a variety of payment methods with a single API. A source represents a customer’s payment instrument, and can be used with the Stripe API to create payments. Sources can be charged directly, or attached to customers for later reuse.\n\nEach [payment method supported](#supported-payment-methods) by the Sources API is defined by four key characteristics. The combination of these characteristics determines how a source is made chargeable, and how it is used in a charge request to complete a payment.\n\n*   [Pull or push](#pull-or-push-of-funds): How the funds for the method of payment are transferred from your customer\n*   [Flow](#flow-for-customer-action): The type of action your customer must take to authenticate the payment\n*   [Usage](#single-use-or-reusable): Whether the `Source` is reusable or not\n*   [Synchronous or asynchronous](#synchronous-or-asynchronous-confirmation): Whether the resulting charge can be confirmed immediately, or only after a delay\n\nFor a complete example illustrating how to accept any payment method using the Sources API, check out this [sample e-commerce store](https://stripe-payments-demo.appspot.com/), and browse its [source code on GitHub](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-payments-demo).\n\n## Supported payment methods![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYou can enable any payment method available to you within the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/payments/settings). Activation is generally instantaneous, and does not require additional contracts nor include a lengthy process. For a detailed listing, take a look at the available payment methods and their [supported geographical regions](https://stripe.com/payments/payment-methods-guide#payment-methods-fact-sheets).\n\nThe following table maps the aforementioned key characteristics to the supported payment methods:\n\n| Transfer | Confirmation | None | Redirect | Code verification | Receiver |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Pull | Synchronous | [Cards](https://docs.stripe.com/sources/cards) | —   | —   | —   |\n| Asynchronous | SEPA Direct Debit (Deprecated) | [ACH debits with authentication](https://docs.stripe.com/ach-deprecated) | [ACH debits with microdeposits](https://docs.stripe.com/ach-deprecated) | —   |\n| Push | Synchronous | *   Alipay (Deprecated)<br>*   Bancontact (Deprecated)<br>*   giropay (Deprecated)<br>*   iDEAL (Deprecated)<br>*   Przelewy24 (Deprecated)<br>*   WeChat Pay (Deprecated) | —   | —   | Multibanco (Deprecated) |\n| Asynchronous | —   | Sofort with Sources (Deprecated) | —   | —   |\n\n## Pull or push of funds![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nEach method of payment is categorized as either pull or push, depending on how funds are transferred from the customer’s payment method.\n\n*   Using a _pull_ method, you debit the funds from the customer’s account after the customer has provided consent. [Card payments](https://docs.stripe.com/sources/cards) are an example of a pull method: your customer’s card is debited when a payment is made, and no customer interaction is required for subsequent debits.\n*   Using a _push_ method, the customer sends the funds to you. ACH Credit Transfers are an example of a push method: Your customer is provided with bank routing and account numbers to which they should send (push) the correct amount. After confirmation that your customer has sent the funds to you, the source becomes chargeable, and is ready to be used in a charge request. Other push payment methods, such as iDEAL or Sofort, rely on a redirect for your customer to push the money to you directly from their online bank account. Generally, push methods require a customer interaction for each payment.\n\n## Flow for customer action![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nCertain payment methods require your customer to complete a particular action (flow) before the source is chargeable. The type of flow that applies to a payment method is stated within the `Source` object’s `flow` parameter. Each method is categorized into one of the following flow types.\n\nNo action is required from your customer. Some payment methods (generally _pull_ methods), such as cards (excluding 3D Secure), require no additional authentication beyond collecting the payment information from customers. Sources representing this payment method can be used immediately when making charge requests.\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/02-none.7bd4a29f0be27cbb0c94a6c891af9d70.png)\n\nOnce the required flow has been completed and a source becomes chargeable, the source must be used to make a charge request for the payment to be completed. If not, the source is canceled and the customer’s authenticated payment is refunded automatically—no money is moved into your account.\n\n## Single-use or reusable![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nCertain payment methods allow for the creation of sources that can be reused for additional payments without your customer needing to complete the payment process again. Sources that can be reused have their `usage` parameter set to `reusable`.\n\nConversely, if a source can only be used once, this parameter is set to `single_use`, and a source must be created each time a customer makes a payment. Such sources should not be attached to customers—instead, they should be charged directly. They can be charged only once, and their status will change to `consumed` when charged.\n\nReusable sources must be attached to a [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api#customers) in order to be reused. (If charged directly, their status will change to `consumed`.) To learn how to attach Sources to [Customers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers \"Customers\"), and to manage a Customer’s sources list, refer to the [Sources and Customers](https://docs.stripe.com/sources/customers) guide.\n\n## Synchronous or asynchronous confirmation![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nOnce you use a payment method to create a [Charge](https://docs.stripe.com/api#charges) object, that charge’s status can be confirmed either immediately (synchronously), or after a certain amount of time (asynchronously).\n\n*   With a synchronous payment method, the charge request’s status can be immediately confirmed as either `succeeded` or `failed`. If the charge request is successful, the payment is completed—it’s considered guaranteed that the customer has been charged, and that you’ll receive the funds. Card payments are an example of a synchronous payment method: there is real-time confirmation of the payment’s success or failure.\n    \n*   For asynchronous payment methods, it can take up to several days to confirm whether the payment has been successful. During this time, the payment cannot be guaranteed. The status of the payment’s `Charge` object is initially set to `pending`, until the payment has been confirmed as successful or failed. ACH debits are an example of an asynchronous method: with these debits, it takes a few days to confirm that the payment has succeeded.\n    \n\nStripe sends a [webhook](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks \"webhook\") event once a charge’s status has changed. When accepting any payment method that is asynchronous, your integration must be able to receive webhooks, so that it can receive this notification and confirm whether the customer’s payment was successful or has failed.",

    "markdown": "# Measuring disputes | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Learn about the potential issues that occur from excessive disputes, and how to avoid them.\n\nThe Stripe Dashboard displays two different calculations to measure your disputes: dispute activity and dispute rate.\n\n*   **Dispute activity** represents the percentage of disputes on successful payments by _dispute_ date.\n    \n*   **Dispute rate** represents the percentage of disputes on successful payments by _charge_ date.\n    \n\nThe two calculations are best understood with an example. Let’s say you processed 1,000 payments in a given week. In that same week, you also received 10 disputes.\n\nOnly 3 of those disputes were from the 1,000 payments processed that week. The other 7 disputes were from payments that were processed at an earlier date. (Because disputes take a while to come in, this delay is very common.)\n\nThe dispute activity for this week would be 1% (10 disputes on 1,000 payments). The dispute rate for this week would be 0.3% (3 disputes on 1,000 payments).\n\n## Dispute activity ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nDispute activity and dispute rate serve different purposes. The card networks’ [dispute and card fraud monitoring programs](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/monitoring-programs) use the dispute _activity_ calculation. If the dispute activity for your business exceeds the thresholds set by the networks for a prolonged period of time (usually multiple months), you might be subject to fines. You can find the dispute activity for your account in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/)’s **Analytics** section.\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/dispute-activity.046c3a284d88711a779563ddfdf1d694.png)\n\n## Dispute rate ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nThe dispute _rate_ is a more accurate representation of fraud and disputes for your business, because it shows which actual payments were disputed. For example, you could use the dispute rate to see a particular sale that resulted in more disputes than usual, or to pick out fraud attack patterns.\n\nBecause cardholders can dispute a charge up to 120 days after a payment was made ([and sometimes even later](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/how-disputes-work#timing)), the dispute rate might change for dates more recent than 120 days old. We show this calculation on the [Radar for Fraud Teams](https://dashboard.stripe.com/radar) page in the Dashboard.\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/dispute-rate.66d11e172aa7ab72dc50ad8fbb1d939d.png)\n\n## Excessive dispute activity ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nEach card network maintains a series of [dispute and card fraud monitoring programs](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/monitoring-programs) that apply to businesses operating with high dispute activity. Excessive dispute activity not only affects your ability to process with Stripe, but with other processors as well—and can even result in fines from the card networks. All disputes, whether they’re won or lost, count towards your dispute rate, so the best strategy to avoid monitoring programs is [dispute prevention](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/prevention).\n\nThe credit card processing industry standard recognizes dispute activity above 0.75% as excessive, but other factors, such as a sudden spike or steep upward trend can trigger placement in a monitoring program before dispute activity reaches the 0.75% threshold. For this reason, if we ever see higher dispute activity or a significant increase in potentially fraudulent activity on your account, we’ll proactively reach out to see how we can help.\n\n## Predicted dispute activity ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nIn some cases, our machine learning models can predict if your account might be in danger of excessive dispute activity at a point in the future. If that happens, we’ll alert you so that you can take proactive steps to [identify and prevent disputes and fraud](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/prevention).\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/dispute-fraud.07e969ae8b005b82469897fb166764f0.png)\n\nThough we can predict dispute trends with some confidence, we cannot predict which particular payments will be disputed. Keep in mind that we cannot be certain of the predicted rate—your actual dispute activity depends upon any further disputes received.\n\n## Early fraud warnings ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\n[Early fraud warnings](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/how-disputes-work#early-fraud-warnings) (EFWs) are messages from Visa and Mastercard that card issuers on these two networks generate to flag payments they suspect might be fraudulent.\n\nThese aren’t informational notes from the card networks. EFWs do sometimes provide the opportunity for you to refund a fraudulent payment before it becomes a fraud dispute, but they’re equally as important when used as a metric by the networks to measure a business’s propensity for fraudulent transactions. Visa in particular counts these fraud warnings toward identification in their [VFMP monitoring program](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/monitoring-programs#vfmp).",

    "markdown": "# Set up future payments | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Learn how to save payment details and charge your customers later.\n\nThe [Setup Intents API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_intents) lets you save a customer’s payment details without an initial payment. This is helpful if you want to onboard customers now, set them up for payments, and charge them in the future—when they’re offline.\n\nUse this integration to set up recurring payments or to create one-time payments with a final amount determined later, often after the customer receives your service.\n\n#### Compliance\n\nYou’re responsible for your compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, and network rules when saving a customer’s payment details. These requirements generally apply if you want to save your customer’s payment method for future use, such as displaying a customer’s payment method to them in the checkout flow for a future purchase or charging them when they’re not actively using your website or app. Add terms to your website or app that state how you plan to save payment method details and allow customers to opt in.\n\nWhen you save a payment method, you can only use it for the specific usage you have included in your terms. To charge a payment method when a customer is offline and save it as an option for future purchases, make sure that you explicitly collect consent from the customer for this specific use. For example, include a “Save my payment method for future use” checkbox to collect consent.\n\nTo charge them when they’re offline, make sure your terms include the following:\n\n*   The customer’s agreement to your initiating a payment or a series of payments on their behalf for specified transactions.\n*   The anticipated timing and frequency of payments (for example, if the charges are for scheduled installments, subscription payments, or unscheduled top-ups).\n*   How you determine the payment amount.\n*   Your cancellation policy, if the payment method is for a subscription service.\n\nMake sure you keep a record of your customer’s written agreement to these terms.\n\n#### Note\n\nIf you need to use manual server-side confirmation or your integration requires presenting payment methods separately, see our [alternative guide](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/save-and-reuse-cards-only).\n\n[](#set-up-stripe)\n\nFirst, [create a Stripe account](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register) or [sign in](https://dashboard.stripe.com/login).\n\nUse our official libraries to access the Stripe API from your application:\n\n`# Available as a gem sudo gem install stripe`\n\n`# If you use bundler, you can add this line to your Gemfile gem 'stripe'`\n\n[](#enable-payment-methods)\n\nView your [payment methods settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) and enable the payment methods you want to support. You need at least one payment method enabled to create a [SetupIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_intents \"Setup Intents API\").\n\nBy default, Stripe enables cards and other prevalent payment methods that can help you reach more customers, but we recommend turning on additional payment methods that are relevant for your business and customers. See [Payment method integration options](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/integration-options#payment-method-product-support) for product and payment method support, and our [pricing page](https://stripe.com/pricing/local-payment-methods) for fees.\n\n[](#create-customer)\n\nTo set up a payment method for future payments, you must attach it to a [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers \"Customers\"). Create a `Customer` object when your customer creates an account with your business. `Customer` objects allow for reusing payment methods and tracking across multiple payments.\n\n`curl -X POST https://api.stripe.com/v1/customers \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\"`\n\n[](#create-intent)\n\n#### Note\n\nA SetupIntent is an object that represents your intent to set up a customer’s payment method for future payments. The payment methods shown to customers during the checkout process are also included on the SetupIntent. You can let Stripe automatically pull payment methods from your Dashboard settings or you can list them manually.\n\nUnless your integration requires a code-based option for offering payment methods, Stripe recommends the automated option. This is because Stripe evaluates the currency, payment method restrictions, and other parameters to determine the list of supported payment methods. Payment methods that increase conversion and that are most relevant to the currency and customer’s location are prioritized. Lower priority payment methods are hidden beneath an overflow menu.\n\nSome payment methods can’t be used to set up future payments. You can still enable these payment methods for other use cases, they just won’t be displayed to customers as an option when setting up future payments. See [Payment method integration options](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/integration-options) for more details about what’s supported.\n\nYou can optionally create a SetupIntent with `automatic_payment_methods` enabled, and the SetupIntent is created using the payment methods you configured in the Dashboard. Specifying the `automatic_payment_methods` parameter is optional because Stripe enables its functionality by default in the latest version of the API.\n\nYou can manage payment methods from the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods). Stripe handles the return of eligible payment methods based on factors such as the transaction’s amount, currency, and payment flow.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/setup_intents \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d customer=  {{CUSTOMER_ID}}   \\  -d \"automatic_payment_methods[enabled]\"=true`\n\n### Retrieve the client secret![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe SetupIntent includes a [client secret](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-client_secret \"PaymentIntent client secret\") that the client side uses to securely complete the payment process. You can use different approaches to pass the client secret to the client side.\n\nRetrieve the client secret from an endpoint on your server, using the browser’s `fetch` function. This approach is best if your client side is a single-page application, particularly one built with a modern frontend framework like React. Create the server endpoint that serves the client secret:\n\n`get '/secret' do   intent = # ... Create or retrieve the SetupIntent   {client_secret: intent.client_secret}.to_json end`\n\nAnd then fetch the client secret with JavaScript on the client side:\n\n`(async () => {   const response = await fetch('/secret');   const {client_secret: clientSecret} = await response.json();   // Render the form using the clientSecret })();`\n\n#### Using Radar\n\nWhen saving a customer’s payment method without an initial payment, [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar) doesn’t act on the SetupIntent by default. If you want to activate this as the default, go to the [Radar settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/radar) and enable **Use Radar on payment methods saved for future use**.\n\n[](#collect-payment-details)\n\nYou’re ready to collect payment details on the client with the [Payment Element](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-element). The Payment Element is a prebuilt UI component that simplifies collecting payment details for a variety of payment methods.\n\nThe Payment Element contains an iframe that securely sends payment information to Stripe over an HTTPS connection. The checkout page address must start with `https://` rather than `http://` for your integration to work. You can test your integration without doing so, but remember to [enable HTTPS](https://docs.stripe.com/security/guide#tls) when you’re ready to accept live payments.\n\n### Set up Stripe.js![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe Payment Element is automatically available as a feature of Stripe.js. Include the Stripe.js script on your checkout page by adding it to the `head` of your HTML file. Always load Stripe.js directly from js.stripe.com to remain PCI compliant. Don’t include the script in a bundle or host a copy of it yourself.\n\nCreate an instance of Stripe with the following JavaScript on your checkout page:\n\n`// Set your publishable key: remember to change this to your live publishable key in production // See your keys here: [https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys) const stripe = Stripe(`\n\n`'pk_test_TYooMQauvdEDq54NiTphI7jx'`\n\n`);`\n\n### Add the Payment Element to your payment setup page![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe Payment Element needs a place to live on your payment setup page. Create an empty DOM node (container) with a unique ID in your payment form:\n\n`<form id=\"payment-form\">   <div id=\"payment-element\">     <!-- Elements will create form elements here -->   </div>   <button id=\"submit\">Submit</button>   <div id=\"error-message\">     <!-- Display error message to your customers here -->   </div> </form>`\n\nWhen the previous form loads, create an instance of the Payment Element and mount it to the container DOM node. Pass the [client secret](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_intents/object#setup_intent_object-client_secret) from the previous step into `options` when you create the [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/js/elements_object/create) instance:\n\n`const options = {   clientSecret: '{{CLIENT_SECRET}}',   // Fully customizable with appearance API.   appearance: {/*...*/}, };  // Set up Stripe.js and Elements using the SetupIntent's client secret const elements = stripe.elements(options);  // Create and mount the Payment Element const paymentElement = elements.create('payment'); paymentElement.mount('#payment-element');`\n\nThe Payment Element renders a dynamic form that allows your customer to pick a payment method. For each payment method, the form automatically asks the customer to fill in all necessary payment details.\n\n### Customize appearance![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nCustomize the Payment Element to match the design of your site by passing the [appearance object](https://docs.stripe.com/js/elements_object/create#stripe_elements-options-appearance) into `options` when creating the `Elements` provider.\n\n### Request Apple Pay merchant token![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nIf you accept Apple Pay payments, we recommend configuring the Apple Pay interface to return a [merchant token](https://docs.stripe.com/apple-pay/merchant-tokens?pay-element=web-pe) to enable merchant initiated transactions (MIT). [Request the relevant merchant token type](https://docs.stripe.com/apple-pay/merchant-tokens?pay-element=web-pe) in the Payment Element. The following example shows a request for the deferred payments merchant token.\n\n`const paymentElement = elements.create('payment', {   applePay: {     deferredPaymentRequest: {       paymentDescription: 'My deferred payment',       managementURL: '[https://example.com/billing](https://example.com/billing)',       deferredBilling: {         amount: 2500,         label: 'Deferred Fee',         deferredPaymentDate: new Date('2024-01-05')       },     }   },   // Other options });`\n\n### Configure currency![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nWhen using SetupIntents with [automatic\\_payment\\_methods](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_intents/create#create_setup_intent-automatic_payment_methods), passing [currency](https://docs.stripe.com/js/elements_object/create#stripe_elements-options-currency) into `options` when creating the `Elements` provider, influences which payment methods are rendered by the Payment Element. Payment Element renders the payment methods enabled in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) that support the provided currency. See [Payment method integration options](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/integration-options) for more details about what’s supported.\n\n### Collect addresses![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nBy default, the Payment Element only collects the necessary billing address details. To collect a customer’s full billing address (to calculate the tax for digital goods and services, for example) or shipping address, use the [Address Element](https://docs.stripe.com/elements/address-element).\n\n[](#submit-payment-details)\n\nUse [stripe.confirmSetup](https://docs.stripe.com/js/setup_intents/confirm_setup) to complete the setup using details collected by the Payment Element. Provide a [return\\_url](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_intents/create#create_setup_intent-return_url) to this function so that Stripe can redirect the user after they complete setup. We may first redirect them to an intermediate site, like a bank authorization page, before redirecting them to the `return_url`.\n\nIf your customer saves their card details, we immediately redirect them to the `return_url` when setup is successful. If you don’t want to redirect for card payments, you can set [redirect](https://docs.stripe.com/js/setup_intents/confirm_setup#confirm_setup_intent-options-redirect) to `if_required`. This only redirects customers that check out with redirect-based payment methods.\n\n``const form = document.getElementById('payment-form');  form.addEventListener('submit', async (event) => {   event.preventDefault();    const {error} = await stripe.confirmSetup({     //`Elements` instance that was used to create the Payment Element     elements,     confirmParams: {       return_url: '[https://example.com/account/payments/setup-complete](https://example.com/account/payments/setup-complete)',     }   });    if (error) {     // This point will only be reached if there is an immediate error when     // confirming the payment. Show error to your customer (for example, payment     // details incomplete)     const messageContainer = document.querySelector('#error-message');     messageContainer.textContent = error.message;   } else {     // Your customer will be redirected to your `return_url`. For some payment     // methods like iDEAL, your customer will be redirected to an intermediate     // site first to authorize the payment, then redirected to the `return_url`.   } });``\n\nMake sure the `return_url` corresponds to a page on your website that [provides the status](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents/verifying-status) of the `SetupIntent`. Stripe provides the following URL query parameters to verify the status when we redirect the customer to the `return_url`. You can also append your own query parameters when providing the `return_url`, and they persist through the redirect process.\n\n| Parameter | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `setup_intent` | The unique identifier for the `SetupIntent`. |\n| `setup_intent_client_secret` | The [client secret](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_intents/object#setup_intent_object-client_secret) of the `SetupIntent` object. |\n\nYou can use [stripe.retrieveSetupIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/js/setup_intents/retrieve_setup_intent) to retrieve the SetupIntent using the `setup_intent_client_secret` query parameter. Successful confirmation of the SetupIntent saves the resulting `PaymentMethod` ID (in `result.setupIntent.payment_method`) to the provided `Customer`.\n\n``// Initialize Stripe.js using your publishable key const stripe = Stripe('{PUBLISHABLE_KEY}');  // Retrieve the \"setup_intent_client_secret\" query parameter appended to // your return_url by Stripe.js const clientSecret = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search).get(   'setup_intent_client_secret' );  // Retrieve the SetupIntent stripe.retrieveSetupIntent(clientSecret).then(({setupIntent}) => {   const message = document.querySelector('#message')    // Inspect the SetupIntent `status` to indicate the status of the payment   // to your customer.   //   // Some payment methods will [immediately succeed or fail][0] upon   // confirmation, while others will first enter a `processing` state.   //   // [0]: [https://stripe.com/docs/payments/payment-methods#payment-notification](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/payment-methods#payment-notification)   switch (setupIntent.status) {     case 'succeeded': {       message.innerText = 'Success! Your payment method has been saved.';       break;     }      case 'processing': {       message.innerText = \"Processing payment details. We'll update you when processing is complete.\";       break;     }      case 'requires_payment_method': {       message.innerText = 'Failed to process payment details. Please try another payment method.';        // Redirect your user back to your payment page to attempt collecting       // payment again        break;     }   } });``\n\n#### Caution\n\nIf you have tooling that tracks the customer’s browser session, you might need to add the `stripe.com` domain to the referrer exclude list. Redirects cause some tools to create new sessions which prevents you from tracking the complete session.\n\n[](#charge-saved-payment-method)\n\n#### Compliance\n\nYou’re responsible for your compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, and network rules when saving a customer’s payment details. When rendering past payment methods to your end customer for future purchases, make sure you’re listing payment methods where you’ve collected consent from the customer to save the payment method details for this specific future use. To differentiate between payment methods attached to customers that can and can’t be presented to your end customer as a saved payment method for future purchases, use the [allow\\_redisplay](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods/object#payment_method_object-allow_redisplay) parameter.\n\nWhen you’re ready to charge your customer off-session, use the Customer and PaymentMethod IDs to create a PaymentIntent. To find a payment method to charge, list the payment methods associated with your customer. This example lists cards but you can list any supported [type](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods/object#payment_method_object-type).\n\n`curl -G https://api.stripe.com/v1/payment_methods \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d customer=  {{CUSTOMER_ID}}   \\  -d type=card`\n\nWhen you have the Customer and PaymentMethod IDs, create a PaymentIntent with the amount and currency of the payment. Set a few other parameters to make the off-session payment:\n\n*   Set [off\\_session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/confirm#confirm_payment_intent-off_session) to `true` to indicate that the customer isn’t in your checkout flow during a payment attempt and can’t fulfill an authentication request made by a partner, such as a card issuer, bank, or other payment institution. If, during your checkout flow, a partner requests authentication, Stripe requests exemptions using customer information from a previous on-session transaction. If the conditions for exemption aren’t met, the PaymentIntent might throw an error.\n*   Set the value of the PaymentIntent’s [confirm](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-confirm) property to `true`, which causes confirmation to occur immediately when the PaymentIntent is created.\n*   Set [payment\\_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api#create_payment_intent-payment_method) to the ID of the PaymentMethod and [customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api#create_payment_intent-customer) to the ID of the Customer.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/payment_intents \\   -u` \n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n``: \\   -d amount=1099 \\   -d currency=usd \\   # In the latest version of the API, specifying the `automatic_payment_methods` parameter is optional because Stripe enables its functionality by default.   -d \"automatic_payment_methods[enabled]\"=true \\   -d customer=\"{{CUSTOMER_ID}}\" \\   -d payment_method=\"{{PAYMENT_METHOD_ID}}\" \\   -d return_url=\"https://example.com/order/123/complete\" \\   -d off_session=true \\   -d confirm=true``\n\nWhen a payment attempt fails, the request also fails with a 402 HTTP status code and the status of the PaymentIntent is [requires\\_payment\\_method](https://docs.stripe.com/upgrades#2019-02-11 \"requires_payment_method\"). You must notify your customer to return to your application to complete the payment (for example, by sending an email or in-app notification).\n\nCheck the code of the [error](https://docs.stripe.com/api/errors/handling) raised by the Stripe API library. If the payment failed due to an [authentication\\_required](https://docs.stripe.com/declines/codes) decline code, use the declined PaymentIntent’s client secret with confirmPayment to allow the customer to authenticate the payment.\n\n``const form = document.getElementById('payment-form');  form.addEventListener('submit', async (event) => {   event.preventDefault();    const {error} = await stripe.confirmPayment({     // The client secret of the PaymentIntent     clientSecret,     confirmParams: {       return_url: '[https://example.com/order/123/complete](https://example.com/order/123/complete)',     },   });    if (error) {     // This point will only be reached if there is an immediate error when     // confirming the payment. Show error to your customer (for example, payment     // details incomplete)     const messageContainer = document.querySelector('#error-message');     messageContainer.textContent = error.message;   } else {     // Your customer will be redirected to your `return_url`. For some payment     // methods like iDEAL, your customer will be redirected to an intermediate     // site first to authorize the payment, then redirected to the `return_url`.   } });``\n\n#### Note\n\n`stripe.confirmPayment` can take several seconds to complete. During that time, disable your form from being resubmitted and show a waiting indicator like a spinner. If you receive an error, show it to the customer, re-enable the form, and hide the waiting indicator. If the customer must perform additional steps to complete the payment, such as authentication, Stripe.js walks them through that process.\n\nIf the payment failed for other reasons, such as insufficient funds, send your customer to a payment page to enter a new payment method. You can reuse the existing PaymentIntent to attempt the payment again with the new payment details.\n\n[](#test-the-integration)\n\nUse test payment details and the test redirect page to verify your integration. Click the tabs below to view details for each payment method.\n\n| Payment method | Scenario | How to test |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Credit card | The card setup succeeds and doesn’t require [authentication](https://docs.stripe.com/strong-customer-authentication \"Strong Customer Authentication\"). | Fill out the credit card form using the credit card number `4242 4242 4242 4242` with any expiration, CVC, and postal code. |\n| Credit card | The card requires authentication for the initial setup, then succeeds for subsequent payments. | Fill out the credit card form using the credit card number `4000 0025 0000 3155` with any expiration, CVC, and postal code. |\n| Credit card | The card requires authentication for the initial setup and also requires authentication for subsequent payments. | Fill out the credit card form using the credit card number `4000 0027 6000 3184` with any expiration, CVC, and postal code. |\n| Credit card | The card is declined during setup. | Fill out the credit card form using the credit card number `4000 0000 0000 9995` with any expiration, CVC, and postal code. |\n\n### Test charging a saved SEPA Debit PaymentMethod![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nConfirming the SetupIntent using iDEAL, Bancontact, or Sofort, generates a [SEPA Direct Debit](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/sepa-debit) [PaymentMethod](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods \"PaymentMethods\"). SEPA Direct Debit is a [delayed notification](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#payment-notification) payment method that transitions to an intermediate `processing` state before transitioning several days later to a `succeeded` or `requires_payment_method` state.\n\nSet `payment_method.billing_details.email` to one of the following values to test the PaymentIntent status transitions. You can include your own custom text at the beginning of the email address followed by an underscore. For example, `test_1_generatedSepaDebitIntentsFail@example.com` results in a SEPA Direct Debit PaymentMethod that always fails when used with a PaymentIntent.\n\n| Email Address | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `generatedSepaDebitIntentsSucceed@example.com` | The PaymentIntent status transitions from `processing` to `succeeded`. |\n| `generatedSepaDebitIntentsSucceedDelayed@example.com` | The PaymentIntent status transitions from `processing` to `succeeded` after three minutes. |\n| `generatedSepaDebitIntentsFail@example.com` | The PaymentIntent status transitions from `processing` to `requires_payment_method`. |\n| `generatedSepaDebitIntentsFailDelayed@example.com` | The PaymentIntent status transitions from `processing` to `requires_payment_method` after three minutes. |\n| `generatedSepaDebitIntentsSucceedDisputed@example.com` | The PaymentIntent status transitions from `processing` to `succeeded`, but a dispute is created immediately. |\n\n[](#disclose-cookies)\n\nStripe collects information on customer interactions with Elements to provide services to you, prevent fraud, and improve its services.

    "markdown": "# Transition to the Payment Intents and Payment Methods APIs\n\n## Learn how to transition from the Sources and Tokens APIs to the Payment Methods API.\n\nThe [Payment Methods API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods) replaces the existing [Tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens) and [Sources](https://docs.stripe.com/api/sources) APIs as the recommended way for integrations to collect and store payment information. It works with the [Payment Intents API](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents) to create payments for a wide range of payment methods.\n\nWe plan to turn off Sources API support for local payment methods. If you currently handle any local payment methods using the Sources API, you must [migrate them to the Payment Methods API](#migrate-local-payment-methods). We’ll send email communication with more information about the end of support for the Sources and Tokens APIs.\n\nWhile we don’t plan to turn off support for card payment methods, we still recommend that you migrate them to the Payment Methods and Payment Intents APIs. For more information about migrating card payment methods, see [Migrating to the Payment Intents API](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents/migration).\n\n## Migrate local payment methods from the Sources API to the Payment Intents API ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nTo migrate your integration for local payment methods, update your server and front end to use the [PaymentIntents API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents). There are three typical integration options:\n\n*   Redirect to [Stripe Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout) for your payment flow.\n*   Use the Stripe [Payment Element](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-element) on your own payment page.\n*   Build your own form and use the Stripe JS SDK to complete the payment.\n\nIf you use Stripe Checkout or the Payment Element, you can add and manage most payment methods from the Stripe Dashboard without making code changes.\n\nFor specific information about integrating a local payment method using the Payment Methods API, see the instructions for that payment method in [the payment methods documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/overview). The following table provides a high-level comparison of the different payment types.\n\n| Old integration | Stripe Checkout | Payment Element | Own form |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|     | Low complexity | Medium complexity | High complexity |\n| Create a Source on the front end or on the server | Create a Checkout Session on the server | Create a PaymentIntent on the server | Create a PaymentIntent on the server |\n| Authorize payment by loading a widget or redirecting to a third party | Not needed | Pass the client secret to the front end and use the Stripe JS SDK to render a Payment Element to complete the payment | Pass the client secret to the front end, use your own form to collect details from your customer, and complete the payment according to the payment method |\n| Confirm the source is chargeable and charge the Source | Not needed | Not needed | Not needed |\n| Confirm the Charge succeeded asynchronously with the `charge.succeeded` webhook | Confirm the Checkout session succeeded with the `payment_intent.succeeded` webhook | Confirm the PaymentIntent succeeded with the `payment_intent.succeeded` webhook | Confirm the PaymentIntent succeeded with the `payment_intent.succeeded` webhook |\n\n#### Caution\n\nA PaymentIntent object represents a payment in the new integration, and it creates a Charge when you confirm the payment on the front end. If you previously stored references to the Charge, you can continue to do so by fetching the Charge ID from the PaymentIntent after the customer completes the payment. However, we also recommend that you store the PaymentIntent ID.\n\n### Checking payment status![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nPreviously, your integration should have checked both the status of the Source and the status of the Charge after each API call. You no longer need to check two statuses—you only need to check the status of the PaymentIntent or the Checkout Session after you confirm it on the front end.\n\n| payment\\_intent.status | Meaning | Special instructions |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `succeeded` | The payment succeeded. | Not applicable |\n| `requires_payment_method` | The payment failed. | Not applicable |\n| `requires_action` | The customer hasn’t completed authorizing the payment. | If the customer doesn’t complete the payment within 48 hours, then the PaymentIntent transitions to `requires_payment_method` and you can retry the confirmation. |\n\nAlways confirm the status of the PaymentIntent by fetching it on your server or listening for the webhooks on your server. Don’t rely solely on the user returning to the `return_url` that’s provided when you confirm the PaymentIntent.\n\n### Refunds![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYou can continue to call the Refunds API with a Charge that the PaymentIntent creates. The ID of the Charge is accessible on the `latest_charge` parameter.\n\nAlternatively, you can provide the PaymentIntent ID to the Refunds API instead of the Charge.\n\n### Error handling![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nPreviously, you had to handle errors on the Sources. With PaymentIntents, instead of checking for errors on a Source, you check for errors on the PaymentIntent when it’s created and after the customer has authorized the payment. Most errors on the PaymentIntent are of `invalid_request_error` type, returned in an invalid request.\n\nWhen you migrate your integration, keep in mind that PaymentIntent error codes can differ from the corresponding error codes for Sources.\n\n### Webhooks![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nIf you previously listened to Source events, you might need to update your integration to listen to new event types. The following table shows some examples.\n\n| Old webhook | New webhook on Checkout | New webhook on PaymentIntents | Special instructions |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `source.chargeable` | Not applicable | Not applicable |     |\n| `source.failed` | Not applicable | Not applicable |     |\n| `source.canceled` | Not applicable | Not applicable |     |\n| `charge.succeeded` | `checkout.session.completed` | `payment_intent.succeeded` | The `charge.succeeded` webhook is also sent, so you don’t have to update your integration to listen to the new webhook. |\n| `charge.failed` | Not applicable - The customer can re-attempt the payment on the same Checkout Session until it [expires](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-expires_at), at which point you receive a `checkout.session.expired` event. | `payment_intent.payment_failed` | The `charge.failed` webhook is also sent, so you don’t have to update your integration to listen to the new webhook. |\n| `charge.dispute.created` | `charge.dispute.created` | `charge.dispute.created` |     |\n\n## Transitioning to the Payment Methods API ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nThe main difference between the Payment Methods and Sources APIs is that Sources describes the transaction state through the [status](https://docs.stripe.com/api/sources/object#source_object-status) property. That means that each `Source` object must transition to a chargeable state before you can use it for a payment. By contrast, a `PaymentMethod` is stateless, relying on the [PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents \"Payment Intents API\") object to represent payment state.\n\n#### Note\n\nThe following table isn’t a comprehensive list of payment methods. If you integrate other payment methods with the Sources API, migrate them to the Payment Methods API as well.\n\nAfter you choose the API to integrate with, use the [guide to payment methods](https://stripe.com/payments/payment-methods-guide) to help you determine the right payment method types you need to support.\n\nThis guide includes detailed descriptions of each payment method and describes the differences in the customer-facing flows, along with the [geographic regions](https://stripe.com/payments/payment-methods-guide#payment-methods-fact-sheets) where they’re most relevant. You can enable any payment method available to you within the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/payments/settings). Activation is generally instantaneous and doesn’t require additional contracts.\n\n## Compatibility with legacy reusable payment methods ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nIf you previously processed any of the following reusable payment methods using [Sources](https://docs.stripe.com/sources), the existing saved sources don’t migrate automatically:\n\n*   Alipay\n*   Bacs Direct Debit\n*   SEPA Direct Debit\n\nTo preserve your existing customers’ saved payment methods, you must convert those sources to payment methods using a data migration tool in the Stripe Dashboard. For instructions on how to convert them, see [the support page](https://support.stripe.com/questions/reusable-object-migration).\n\n## Compatibility with legacy card objects ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nIf you previously collected card customer payment details with Stripe using [cards](https://docs.stripe.com/saving-cards) or [Sources](https://docs.stripe.com/sources), you can start using the Payment Methods API immediately without migrating any payment information.\n\nCompatible payment instruments that have been saved to a [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers \"Customers\") are usable in any API that accepts a [PaymentMethod](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods \"PaymentMethods\") object. For example, you can use a saved card as a PaymentMethod when creating a PaymentIntent:\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/payment_intents \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d \"payment_method_types[]\"=card \\  -d amount=1099 \\  -d currency=usd \\  -d customer=  {{CUSTOMER_ID}}   \\  -d payment_method=  {{CARD_ID}}    `\n\nRemember to provide the customer ID that your compatible payment instrument is saved to when attaching the object to a PaymentIntent.\n\nYou can [retrieve](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods/retrieve) all saved compatible payment instruments through the Payment Methods API.\n\n`{   \"id\": \"card_1EBXBSDuWL9wT9brGOaALeD2\",   \"object\": \"card\",   \"address_city\": \"San Francisco\",   \"address_country\": \"US\",   \"address_line1\": \"1234 Fake Street\",   \"address_line1_check\": null,   \"address_line2\": null,   \"address_state\": null,   \"address_zip\": null,`\n\n`{   \"id\": \"card_1EBXBSDuWL9wT9brGOaALeD2\",   \"object\": \"payment_method\",   \"billing_details\": {     \"address\": {       \"city\": \"San Francisco\",       \"country\": \"US\",       \"line1\": \"1234 Fake Street\",       \"line2\": null,       \"postal_code\": null,`\n\nWith this compatibility, no new objects are created; the Payment Methods API provides a different view of the same underlying object. For example, updates to a compatible payment instrument through the Payment Methods API is visible through the Sources API, and vice versa.\n\n## See also![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n*   [Guide to payment methods](https://stripe.com/payments/payment-methods-guide)\n*   [Connect platforms using the Payment Methods API](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/connect)\n*   [Payment Methods API reference](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods)",

Users of [Adaptive Acceptance](https://stripe.com/in/payments/authorization) get access to a premium Authentication Engine that further enhances performance using machine learning, which includes Transaction Risk Analysis (TRA) exemptions up to 440 GBP (beta for select users) and Data Only flows.\n\n#### Note\n\nWhen the customer’s bank approves an exemption request, liability shift for fraudulent transactions doesn’t apply.\n\nStripe’s Authentication Engine currently supports the following SCA exemptions:\n\n| SCA Exemption | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Low Value | Applies to transaction amounts less than 30 EUR (25 GBP). However, SCA might still be required by the issuer for low value transactions when either of the following scenarios are met:<br><br>*   The cumulative amount for transactions initiated by the cardholder since SCA was last performed exceeds 100 EUR (85 GBP).<br>*   The cardholder has initiated five transactions since SCA was last performed. |\n| Transaction Risk Analysis (TRA) or Low Risk Exemption | A payment provider (such as Stripe) can perform real-time risk analysis to determine whether a transaction warrants SCA. This permission is subject to the payment provider’s overall fraud rates for card payments in relevant markets staying below the following thresholds:<br><br>*   0.13% to exempt transactions up to 100 EUR (85 GBP)<br>*   0.06% to exempt transactions up to 250 EUR (220 GBP)<br>*   0.01% to exempt transactions up to 500 EUR (440 GBP)<br><br>Local equivalent amounts for these thresholds apply where relevant. See [Stripe’s current threshold limits for TRA](#stripe-tra-limits) for more on Stripe’s current TRA exemption availability. |\n| Merchant-initiated transactions (including variable subscriptions) | Payments made with saved cards when the customer isn’t present in the checkout flow (sometimes called “off-session”) might qualify as merchant-initiated transactions (MITs). These payments technically fall outside the scope of SCA. In practice, marking a payment as MIT is similar to requesting an exemption; neither a customer challenge nor a liability shift occurs. To use merchant-initiated transactions, you authenticate the card when it’s being saved. You must also secure agreement from the customer (through a mandate) to charge their card at a later point. The [Stripe API](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/more-payment-scenarios) lets you authenticate a card when it’s being saved for later use and mark subsequent payments as MITs. |\n\n## Stripe’s Transaction Risk Analysis (TRA) limits ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nStripe’s Authentication Engine uses comprehensive, real-time risk assessment that allows us to support this exemption for our users. The exemption limit available for you depends on Stripe’s overall fraud rates and your access to Stripe’s authentication offerings, including [Adaptive Acceptance](https://stripe.com/in/payments/authorization). Currently:\n\n*   UK and Swiss merchants have access to TRA exemptions for qualifying low risk transactions up to 220 GBP.\n*   EEA merchants have access to TRA exemptions for qualifying low risk transactions up to 250 EUR.\n*   Beta Certain eligible UK merchants that have access to [Adaptive Acceptance](https://stripe.com/in/payments/authorization) and meet Stripe’s fraud criteria can participate in our limited TRA exemptions beta program for qualifying low risk transactions up to 440 GBP. To determine your eligibility, [contact sales](https://stripe.com/contact/sales).\n\n## Data Only ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nData Only is a form of authentication supported by some card schemes that leverages 3D Secure (3DS) data. The Data Only flow sends the authentication request to the card network, who includes its own risk data in the authorization message, before sending it to the issuer. Successful Data Only requests offer a frictionless experience that improves approval rates for payments that aren’t subject to SCA.\n\n#### Note\n\nBecause we don’t send an authentication request to the issuer in a Data Only flow, no liability shift occurs for the business.\n\nThe standard Data Only flow requires 3DS version 2.2 or later. Mastercard has its own Data Only product, Mastercard Identity Check Insights, which Stripe currently offers to [Adaptive Acceptance](https://stripe.com/in/payments/authorization) users in EEA and UK only. Instead of sending a transaction straight to authorization, Stripe’s ML-based Authentication Engine uses the Data Only flow to improve conversion or optimize costs for certain transactions. Handling these requests requires no further action from businesses.",

If either of these parameters indicates that the exemption is low risk due to acquirer transaction risk analysis, Stripe reassesses the transaction, as described in [Import 3DS exempted outcomes](#import-exempted-outcomes).\n\n*   If you have access to `cb_exemption`, pass that value and don’t populate `exemption_indicator`. Stripe infers the appropriate exemption indicator based on `cb_exemption`.\n*   If you pass both the `cb_exemption` parameter and `exemption_indicator` parameter, make sure that they both correctly indicate the exempted status.\n*   If there’s a mismatch where `exemption_indicator=none` and the bitmap in `cb_exemption` indicates that the applied exemption is a low risk exemption, Stripe rejects the request.\n\n## Testing![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYou can validate your integration in test mode using either the authentication required test card: `4000 0027 6000 3184` or `pm_card_authenticationRequired`.\n\nThe simulation accepts any correctly-formatted 3D Secure result. For example:\n\n*   Version: `2.1.0`\n*   Electronic Commerce Indicator: `02`\n*   Cryptogram: `M6+990I6FLD8Y6rZz9d5QbfrMNY=`\n*   Transaction ID: `5f5d08f2-8c36-4f72-99d1-57b4fb70b7d5`\n\nOr:\n\n*   Version: `2.2.0`\n*   Electronic Commerce Indicator: `05`\n*   Cryptogram: `4BQwsg4yuKt0S1LI1nDZTcO9vUM=`\n*   Transaction ID: `f879ea1c-aa2c-4441-806d-e30406466d79`\n\n### Exemptions granted through 3DS![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nIn test mode, all cards that include `exemption_indicator` return `exemption_indicator_applied` as true. To test a PaymentIntent creation that doesn’t pass the internal TRA check, and that returns false, use card number `4000 0000 0001 6123` and set `exemption_indicator=low_risk`.\n\n### Cartes Bancaires![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYou can use the following co-badged cards to test importing Cartes Bancaires outcomes:\n\n| Number | Brand | CVC | Date |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|     | Cartes Bancaires / Visa | Any 3 digits | Any future date |\n|     | Cartes Bancaires / Mastercard | Any 3 digits | Any future date |\n|     | Cartes Bancaires / Visa | Any 3 digits | Any future date |\n\nYou can use any valid `cb_exemption` value in your tests. For example:\n\n*   `AAAA` - No exemption granted\n*   `BAAA` - Low risk exemption granted\n\nLike [the standard exemptions flow](#exemptions-granted-through-3ds), when the value of `cb_exemption` corresponds to low risk, only the test card `4000 0000 0001 6123` returns false for [exemption\\_indicator\\_applied](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/object#charge_object-payment_method_details-card-three_d_secure-exemption_indicator_applied).\n\n## Raw PAN usage![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nStripe requires users to validate that cardholder data is handled securely and in compliance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) before granting access to raw card data APIs.\n\nFor businesses that require this functionality, Stripe imposes stringent requirements, including:\n\n*   Validation of PCI DSS compliance\n*   Submission to Stripe’s rigorous review process\n*   Agreement to maintain additional controls on top of Stripe’s default security settings\n\nSee [Enabling access to raw card data APIs](https://support.stripe.com/questions/enabling-access-to-raw-card-data-apis) support article for enablement details.\n\n#### Note\n\nFor accounts with custom pricing, if you specify Stripe as your acquirer in the 3D Secure request, Stripe passes network costs applicable to 3D Secure through, per your agreement with Stripe.",

    "markdown": "# Dispute withdrawals | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Learn what to do when a cardholder withdraws their payment dispute.\n\nThe most effective dispute strategy for your business is to [reduce the number of disputes](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/prevention) it receives in the first place.\n\nIf you do receive a dispute, the most effective way to proceed is to work directly with your customer to resolve the issue.\n\nEvery card network has some provision in its dispute system for the cardholder to retract a dispute after filing it. If you can settle the matter amicably with your customer, and convince them to withdraw the dispute, that’s the best way to win it.\n\n## What is a withdrawn dispute![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nA withdrawn dispute is one that your customer has asked their card issuer to cancel. It isn’t _necessarily_ a won dispute, as the dispute might still resolve as a loss if you haven’t submitted evidence.\n\nA withdrawn dispute is otherwise no different from any other dispute.\n\n*   It doesn’t resolve as a win or loss more quickly than other disputes.\n*   It doesn’t show up differently from any other dispute in the Dashboard or API.\n*   It still counts against your [dispute rate](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/measuring) with the network.\n\nCardholders can only withdraw fully financial disputes—that is, a chargeback, where your account balance has been debited. They can’t withdraw an [Early Fraud Warning](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/how-disputes-work#early-fraud-warnings) or an [inquiry](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/how-disputes-work#inquiries), which don’t have financial impact. The cardholder might decline to escalate these, but can’t undo them.\n\n## Assessing the value of pursuing a dispute withdrawal![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nAlthough a dispute withdrawal is a good way to turn a dispute into a win, and a way to resolve a negative experience for your customer, it also requires some effort to initiate and complete an interaction with your customer. It might not be the most cost efficient approach for every dispute, and you’ll have to weigh the increased operational burden against the lift it gives your dispute win rate.\n\nFor disputes with a [high likelihood of winning](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/best-practices#likelihood-of-winning-disputes), you might want to only submit evidence to fight it, without reaching out to your customer. For low value disputes you might want to go ahead and [accept the dispute](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/responding#decide).\n\n## Talk to your customer![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nReach out to your customer to better understand their complaint, and try to work through the problem with them. If you’re able to satisfy the customer, ask them to reach out to their card issuer and withdraw the dispute. The process for this varies by issuer, but in general the customer should use whatever normal support channels they use to get help from their issuer.\n\nIf your customer does agree to withdraw the dispute, consider asking them whether they would provide confirmation of the withdrawal, such as a withdrawal-confirmation email from their bank or a screenshot of their mobile banking statement showing they were re-billed for the charge. This type of evidence isn’t required for your response to the issuer, but it could be helpful if your customer is willing to do it.\n\n#### Warning\n\nIf part of the resolution with your customer involves an agreement that you will issue a refund to them, be aware that it might be weeks or even months before you’re able to issue one. Your customer withdrawing the dispute doesn’t necessarily speed up their issuer’s dispute timeline. You [can’t issue a refund](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/how-disputes-work#receiving-a-dispute) on a disputed charge until your customer’s card issuer returns a win on the dispute.\n\n## Submit evidence![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nRegardless of what happens between you and your customer, you still need to [submit evidence](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/responding#respond) if you want to win the dispute.\n\n#### Warning\n\nAlways provide evidence for every dispute you hope to have resolved in your favor, even if your customer told you they’re withdrawing the dispute. Many card issuers treat failure to submit evidence as an acceptance of liability on your part. This means that even if the customer did withdraw the dispute with their issuer, you can still lose the dispute if you don’t submit evidence.\n\nYou can submit evidence for a dispute just one time, so you want to wait long enough for your conversation with the customer to play out, but not so long that you miss the deadline. The card network rules don’t allow you to submit evidence after the deadline.\n\nIf you can’t convince the customer to withdraw the dispute before the evidence deadline, that’s okay. You should still file [appropriate evidence](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/categories) to challenge the dispute reason.\n\n## Wait for the dispute resolution![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nIn general, disputes that have been withdrawn don’t resolve any faster than other kinds of dispute.\n\nAfter your customer withdraws a dispute, and you submit evidence, you can expect that the dispute will still follow the [normal dispute timeline](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/how-disputes-work#timing) to come back with a win or loss from the network.\n\n## Late withdrawal of dispute![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nIt’s technically possible on every card network for a cardholder to withdraw a dispute after the response deadline, and even long after a dispute itself is lost. However, some card issuers within that network might not support the late withdrawal of a dispute in every case. As with any other dispute, the cardholder needs to reach out to their issuer to request a late withdrawal and find out whether or not they allow it.\n\nKeep in mind that late withdrawals often happen _outside_ the networks’ dispute systems. Unlike with the regular dispute lifecycle, they aren’t governed by any network rules or regulations. Consequently when a customer withdraws an old, lost dispute, it’s hard to set a realistic expectation for how soon you can expect to see it reflected in your Stripe account. It’s possible it could take the cardholder’s issuer weeks or months to process this type of adjustment.",

    "markdown": "# Authenticate with 3D Secure | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Integrate 3D Secure (3DS) into your checkout flow.\n\n#### Caution\n\nYou can integrate 3D Secure (3DS) authentication into your checkout flow on multiple platforms, including Web, iOS, Android, and React Native. This integration runs [3D Secure 2 (3DS2)](https://stripe.com/guides/3d-secure-2) when supported by the customer’s bank and falls back to 3D Secure 1 otherwise. To use Stripe’s 3DS service with other processors, [contact support](https://support.stripe.com/contact).\n\n![Checkout page](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/3ds-flow-1-checkout-page.039294e0dee3a6dede8ea8a32185aae5.png)\n\nThe customer enters their card details.\n\n![Loading symbol](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/3ds-flow-2-frictionless-flow.417618d0570c469cfb6bbc43630c7896.png)\n\nThe customer’s bank assesses the transaction and can complete 3D Secure at this step.\n\n![Authentication modal](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/3ds-flow-3-challenge-flow.9052a220f336bbdb75a51799622c6477.png)\n\nIf required by their bank, the customer completes an additional authentication step.\n\n## Control the 3DS flow ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nStripe triggers 3DS automatically if required by a regulatory mandate such as [Strong Customer Authentication](https://docs.stripe.com/strong-customer-authentication) or requested by an issuer with the [soft decline](https://docs.stripe.com/declines/codes) code `authentication_required`.\n\nYou can also [use Radar rules](#three-ds-radar) or [the API](#manual-three-ds) to control when to prompt users to complete 3DS authentication, making a determination for each user based on the desired parameters. However, not all transactions support 3DS, for example wallets or off-session payments.\n\nWhen a payment triggers 3DS, Stripe requires the user to perform authentication to complete the payment if 3DS authentication is available for a card. Depending on what frontend you use, this might require you to [display the 3DS Flow](#when-to-use-3d-secure).\n\nIn a typical Payment Intent API flow that triggers 3DS:\n\n1.  The user enters their payment information, which confirms a PaymentIntent, SetupIntent, or attaches a PaymentMethod to a Customer.\n2.  Stripe assesses if the transaction supports and requires 3DS based on regulatory mandates, Radar rules, manual API requests, issuer soft declines, and other criteria.\n3.  If 3DS is:\n    *   **Not required**: For example, because of an [exemption](https://stripe.com/guides/strong-customer-authentication#exemptions-to-strong-customer-authentication \"SCA exemptions\"), Stripe attempts the charge. The PaymentIntent transitions to a status of `processing`. If requested by the issuer with a [soft decline](https://docs.stripe.com/declines/codes), we automatically reattempt and continue as if required.\n    *   **Not supported**: The PaymentIntent transitions to a status of `requires_payment_method`. Depending on the reason 3DS was triggered it might be permissible to continue to the authorization step for the charge. In that case, the PaymentIntent transitions to a status of `processing`.\n    *   **Required**: Stripe starts the 3DS authentication flow by contacting the card issuer’s 3D Secure Access Control Server (ACS) and starting the 3DS flow.\n4.  When Stripe receives 3DS flow information from the issuer, we attempt authentication. The PaymentIntent transitions to a status of `requires_action`:\n    *   See below for how to [display the required 3DS action](#when-to-use-3d-secure). Issuers might request different 3DS flow action types, which might not always result in visibly displaying a 3DS challenge (for example, a frictionless flow).\n    *   If the issuer doesn’t support 3DS at all or has an outage, Stripe might attempt to complete the payment without authentication if permissible.\n    *   If Stripe already has access to all the required 3DS data elements, our optimized 3DS server might attempt to complete the authentication request for you while confirming the PaymentIntent. This can result in the PaymentIntent directly transitioning to a status of `processing` if the 3DS flow succeeds, or to a status of `requires_action` if additional steps or data elements are required to complete the 3DS flow.\n5.  Depending on the 3DS authentication result:\n    *   **Authenticated**: Stripe attempts the charge and the PaymentIntent transitions to a status of `processing`.\n    *   **Failure**: The PaymentIntent transitions to a status of `requires_payment_method`, indicating that you need to try a different payment method, or you can retry 3DS by reconfirming.\n    *   **Other scenarios**: Depending on the reason the payment triggered 3DS, it might be permissible to continue authorization for the charge in [edge cases](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/object#charge_object-payment_method_details-card-three_d_secure-result). For example, a result of `attempt_acknowledged` leads to a charge and the PaymentIntent transitions to a status of `processing`.\n        *   An exception is when creating [Indian e-mandates for recurring payments](https://docs.stripe.com/india-recurring-payments). Anything but an `authenticated` result is treated as failure.\n6.  The PaymentIntent transitions to one of the following statuses, depending on the outcome of the payment: `succeeded`, `requires_capture`, or `requires_payment_method`.\n\nTo track whether 3DS was supported and attempted on a card payment, read the [three\\_d\\_secure](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/object#charge_object-payment_method_details-card-three_d_secure) property on the card information in the Charge’s `payment_method_details`. Stripe populates the `three_d_secure` property when the customer attempts to authenticate the card—`three_d_secure.result` indicates the authentication outcome.\n\n### Use Radar rules in the Dashboard ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nStripe provides [default Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/rules#request-3d-secure) rules to dynamically request 3DS when creating or confirming a [PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents) or [SetupIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_intents). You can configure these rules in your [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/radar/rules).\n\nIf you have [Radar for Fraud Teams](https://stripe.com/radar/fraud-teams), you can add [custom 3DS rules](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/rules#request-3d-secure).\n\n### Manually request 3DS with the API ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nThe default method to trigger 3DS is [using Radar to dynamically request 3D Secure](#three-ds-radar) based on risk level and other requirements. Triggering 3DS manually is for advanced users integrating Stripe with their own fraud engine.\n\nTo trigger 3DS manually, set `payment_method_options[card][request_three_d_secure]` to `any` or `challenge` depending on what you want to optimize for when creating or confirming a [PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-payment_method_options-card-request_three_d_secure) or [SetupIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_intents/create#create_setup_intent-payment_method_options-card-request_three_d_secure). This process is the same for one-time payments or when setting up a payment method for future payments. When you provide this parameter, Stripe attempts to perform 3DS and overrides any [dynamic 3D Secure Radar rules](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/rules) on the PaymentIntent or SetupIntent.\n\nWhen to provide this parameter depends on when your fraud engine detects risk. For example, if your fraud engine only inspects card details, you know whether to request 3DS before you create the PaymentIntent or SetupIntent. If your fraud engine inspects both card and transaction details, provide the parameter during confirmation—when you have more information. Then pass the resulting PaymentIntent or SetupIntent to your client to complete the process.\n\nExplore the `request_three_d_secure` parameter’s usage for each case in the API reference:\n\n*   [Create a PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-payment_method_options-card-request_three_d_secure)\n*   [Confirm a PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/confirm#confirm_payment_intent-payment_method_options-card-request_three_d_secure)\n*   [Create a SetupIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_intents/create#create_setup_intent-payment_method_options-card-request_three_d_secure)\n*   [Confirm a SetupIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_intents/confirm#confirm_setup_intent-payment_method_options-card-request_three_d_secure)\n\nSet `request_three_d_secure` to `any` to manually request 3DS with a preference for a `frictionless` flow, increasing the likelihood of the authentication being completed without any additional input from the customer.\n\nSet `request_three_d_secure` to `challenge` to request 3DS with a preference for a `challenge` flow, where the customer must respond to a prompt for active authentication.\n\nStripe can’t guarantee your preference because the issuer determines the ultimate authentication flow. You can find out what the ultimate authentication flow was by inspecting the `authentication_flow` on the `three_d_secure` property of the [Charge](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/object#charge_object-payment_method_details-card-three_d_secure-authentication_flow) or [SetupAttempt](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_attempts/object#setup_attempt_object-payment_method_details-card-three_d_secure-authentication_flow). To learn more about 3DS flows, read our [guide](https://stripe.com/guides/3d-secure-2#frictionless-authentication).\n\n#### Caution\n\nStripe only requires your customer to perform authentication to complete the payment successfully if 3DS authentication is available for a card. If it’s not available for the given card or if an error occurred during the authentication process, the payment proceeds normally.\n\nStripe’s SCA rules run automatically, regardless of whether or not you manually request 3DS. Any 3DS prompts from you are additional and not required for SCA.\n\n## Display the 3DS flow ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nStripe automatically displays the authentication UI in a pop-up modal when calling `confirmCardPayment` and `handleCardAction`. You can also redirect to the bank’s website or use an iframe.\n\nStripe.js collects [basic device information](https://support.stripe.com/questions/3d-secure-2-device-information) during 3DS2 authentication and sends it to the issuing bank for their risk analysis.\n\n### Redirect to the bank website ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nTo redirect your customer to the 3DS authentication page, pass a `return_url` to the PaymentIntent when confirming [on the server](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/confirm#confirm_payment_intent-return_url) or on the [client](https://docs.stripe.com/js/payment_intents/confirm_card_payment).\n\nAfter confirmation, if a PaymentIntent has a [requires\\_action](https://docs.stripe.com/upgrades#2019-02-11 \"requires_action\") status, inspect the PaymentIntent’s `next_action`. If it contains `redirect_to_url`, that means 3DS is required.\n\nIn the browser, redirect the customer to the `url` in the redirect\\_to\\_url hash to complete authentication.\n\n`var action = intent.next_action;   if (action && action.type === 'redirect_to_url') {     window.location = action.redirect_to_url.url;   }`\n\nWhen the customer finishes the authentication process, the redirect sends them back to the `return_url` you specified when you created or confirmed the PaymentIntent. The redirect also adds `payment_intent` and `payment_intent_client_secret` URL query parameters that your application can use to identify the PaymentIntent associated with the purchase.\n\n### Display in an iframe ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nYou can’t customize the authentication UI on the web to match your website’s design—the bank that issued the card controls the fonts and colors.\n\nHowever, you can choose _how_ and _where_ to show the 3D Secure UI. Most businesses show it in a modal dialog above their payment page. If you have your own modal component, you can place the 3DS frame inside of it. You can also show the authentication content inline with your payment form.\n\n#### Confirm the PaymentIntent Server-side![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nWhen your customer is ready to complete their purchase, you [confirm](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/confirm \"confirm\") the PaymentIntent to begin the process of collecting their payment.\n\nIf you want to control how to display 3DS, provide a `return_url`, which is where the 3DS `<iframe>` is redirected when authentication is complete. If your site uses a [content security policy](https://docs.stripe.com/security/guide#content-security-policy), check that it allows iframes from `https://js.stripe.com`, `https://hooks.stripe.com`, and the origin of the URL you passed to `return_url`.\n\nIf you’re confirming from the frontend, use the [`confirmCardPayment`](https://docs.stripe.com/js#stripe-confirm-card-payment) method in Stripe.js. For example, if you’re gathering card information using Stripe Elements:\n\n`stripe.confirmCardPayment(   '{{PAYMENT_INTENT_CLIENT_SECRET}}',   {     payment_method: {card: cardElement},     return_url: 'https://example.com/return_url'   },   // Disable the default next action handling.   {handleActions: false} ).then(function(result) {   // Handle result.error or result.paymentIntent   // More details in Step 2. });`\n\nIf you confirm from your server, provide a `return_url`. Depending on your integration, you might want to pass other information to [`confirm`](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/confirm) as well.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/payment_intents/{{PAYMENT_INTENT_ID}}/confirm \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\   --data-urlencode return_url=\"[https://example.com/return_url](https://example.com/return_url)\"`\n\n#### Check the PaymentIntent status Server-side![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nNext, inspect the [status property](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-status) property of the confirmed PaymentIntent to determine whether the payment completed successfully. The following list describes possible `status` values and their significance:\n\n| Status | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `requires_payment_method` | The request failed with a `402` HTTP status code, meaning that the payment was unsuccessful. Check the [last\\_payment\\_error](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-last_payment_error) property and try again, collecting new payment information from the customer if necessary. |\n| `requires_capture` | The request completed without authentication. You can continue to [capture the funds](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/place-a-hold-on-a-payment-method#capture-funds). |\n| `requires_action` | An additional step such as 3DS is required to complete the payment. Ask the customer to return to your application to complete payment. |\n| `succeeded` | The payment completed, creating a Charge with the supplied payment method. No further steps are required. |\n\nOn versions of the API before [2019-02-11](https://docs.stripe.com/upgrades#2019-02-11), `requires_payment_method` appears as `requires_source` and `requires_action` appears as `requires_source_action`.\n\n#### Render the 3DS iframe Client-side![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nWhen the value of the `status` property is `requires_action`, you need to complete an additional step before processing the payment. For a card payment that requires 3DS, the PaymentIntent’s `status` shows as `requires_action` and its [next\\_action](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-next_action) property appears as `redirect_to_url`. The `redirect_to_url` payload contains a URL that opens in an iframe to display 3DS:\n\n`var iframe = document.createElement('iframe');   iframe.src = paymentIntent.next_action.redirect_to_url.url;   iframe.width = 600;   iframe.height = 400;   yourContainer.appendChild(iframe);`\n\nFor 3DS2, card issuers are required to support showing the 3DS content at sizes of 250x400, 390x400, 500x600, 600x400, and full screen (dimensions are width by height). You might enhance the 3DS UI by opening the iframe at exactly one of those sizes.\n\n#### Caution\n\nYou can’t use the `sandbox` attribute on the 3DS iframe. In live mode, the card issuer controls some content inside this iframe. Some issuers’ implementations fail if they’re sandboxed, and the payment won’t succeed.\n\n#### Handle the redirect Client-side![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nAfter the customer completes 3DS, the iframe redirects to the `return_url` you provided when confirming the PaymentIntent. That page needs to `postMessage` to your top-level page to inform it that 3DS authentication is complete. Your top-level page then needs to determine whether the payment succeeded or requires further action from your customer.\n\nFor example, you might have your `return_url` page execute:\n\n`window.top.postMessage('3DS-authentication-complete');`\n\nYour top payment page needs to listen for this postMessage to know when authentication has finished. You then need to retrieve the updated PaymentIntent and check on the status of the payment. If the authentication failed, the PaymentIntent’s status is `requires_payment_method`. If the payment completed successfully, the status is `succeeded`. If you use [separate authorize and capture](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/place-a-hold-on-a-payment-method), the status is `requires_capture` instead.\n\n`function on3DSComplete() {     // Hide the 3DS UI     yourContainer.remove();      // Check the PaymentIntent     stripe.retrievePaymentIntent('{{PAYMENT_INTENT_CLIENT_SECRET}}')       .then(function(result) {         if (result.error) {           // PaymentIntent client secret was invalid         } else {           if (result.paymentIntent.status === 'succeeded') {             // Show your customer that the payment has succeeded           } else if (result.paymentIntent.status === 'requires_payment_method') {             // Authentication failed, prompt the customer to enter another payment method           }         }       });   }    window.addEventListener('message', function(ev) {     if (ev.data === '3DS-authentication-complete') {       on3DSComplete();     }   }, false);`\n\n## Test the 3DS flow ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nUse a Stripe test card with any CVC, postal code, and future expiration date to trigger 3DS authentication challenge flows while in test mode.\n\nWhen you build an integration with your test API keys, the authentication process displays a mock authentication page. On that page, you can either authorize or cancel the payment. Authorizing the payment simulates successful authentication and redirects you to the specified return URL. Clicking the **Failure** button simulates an unsuccessful attempt at authentication.\n\n| Number | 3DS usage | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|     | Required | The payment must always complete 3DS2 authentication to be successful. By default, your Radar rules request 3DS authentication for this card. |\n|     | Required | This card requires 3DS2 authentication for off-session payments unless you [set it up](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/save-and-reuse) for future payments. After you set it up, off-session payments no longer require authentication. |\n|     | Required | 3DS authentication is required, but payments will be declined with a `card_declined` failure code after authentication. By default, your Radar rules request 3DS authentication for this card. |\n|     | Supported | 3DS authentication can still be performed, but isn’t required. By default, your Radar rules won’t request 3DS authentication for this card. |\n|     | Supported | This card supports 3DS, but it isn’t enrolled in 3DS. This means that if your Radar rules request 3DS, the customer won’t go through additional authentication. By default, your Radar rules won’t request 3DS authentication for this card. |\n|     | Not supported | This card doesn’t support 3DS and you can’t invoke it. The PaymentIntent proceeds without performing authentication. |\n\nAll other Visa and Mastercard [test cards](https://docs.stripe.com/testing) don’t require authentication from the customer’s card issuer.\n\nYou can write [custom Radar rules in test mode](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/radar/rules) to trigger authentication on test cards. Learn more about [testing your Radar rules](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/testing).\n\n## Disputes and liability shift ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nThe liability shift rule applies to payments that are successfully authenticated using [3D Secure](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure \"3D Secure (3DS)\") or an equivalent cryptogram such as [Apple Pay](https://docs.stripe.com/apple-pay) or [Google Pay](https://docs.stripe.com/google-pay) in some cases. If a cardholder [disputes](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes) a 3DS payment as fraudulent, the liability shifts from you to the card issuer.\n\nIf a card doesn’t support 3DS or an error occurs during the authentication process, the payment proceeds normally. When this occurs, liability doesn’t generally shift to the issuer, because a successful 3DS authentication hasn’t taken place.\n\nIn practice, this means that you won’t receive disputes marked as fraudulent if the payment was covered by the liability shift rule, but you might still receive an [Early Fraud Warning](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/how-disputes-work#early-fraud-warnings). You might still receive a low percentage of fraudulent disputes, and we list a few cases below where the liability shift rule might not apply.\n\nYou might receive a [dispute inquiry](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/how-disputes-work#inquiries) on a successfully authenticated payment using 3DS. This type of dispute doesn’t precipitate a chargeback because it’s only a request for information.\n\nIf you receive an inquiry for a 3D-Secure-authenticated charge, you _must_ respond. If you don’t, the cardholder’s bank can initiate a financial chargeback known as a “no-reply” chargeback that could invalidate the liability shift. To prevent no-reply chargebacks on 3DS charges, submit sufficient information about the charge. Include information about what was ordered, how it was delivered, and who it was delivered to (whether it was physical or electronic goods, or services).\n\n#### Note\n\nIf a customer disputes a payment for any other reason (for example, [product not received](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/categories)), then the standard dispute process applies. Make informed decisions about your business management, especially in handling and completely avoiding disputes.\n\nLiability shift might also occur when the card network requires 3DS, but it isn’t available for the card or issuer. This can happen if the issuer’s 3DS server is down or if the issuer doesn’t support it, despite the card network requiring support. During the payment process, the cardholder isn’t prompted to complete 3DS authentication, because the card isn’t enrolled. Although the cardholder didn’t complete 3DS authentication, liability can still shift to the issuer.\n\nStripe returns the requested Electronic Commerce Indicator (ECI) in the `electronic_commerce_indicator` of the [3DS authentication outcome](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/object#charge_object-payment_method_details-card-three_d_secure). This indicator can aid in determining whether a charge should adhere to the liability shift rule. As 3DS occurs subsequent to the initial payment intent response, you typically get this from a `charge.succeeded` [webhook](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks). A requested ECI might be degraded in the issuer response, which we don’t reveal.\n\nSometimes payments that are successfully authenticated using 3DS don’t fall under liability shift. This is rare and can happen, for example, if you have an excessive level of fraud on your account and are enrolled in a [fraud monitoring program](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/monitoring-programs#vfmp). Certain networks have also exempted some industries from liability shift. For example, Visa doesn’t support liability shift for businesses engaging in wire transfer or money orders, non-financial institutions offering foreign or non-fiat currency, or stored-value card purchase or load.\n\nIn rare cases, liability shift might get downgraded post-authorization, or the card networks’ dispute rejection system might fail to catch liability shift for a transaction. In these cases, if you counter the dispute, Stripe automatically adds the requested ECI and the [3DS authentication outcome](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/object#charge_object-payment_method_details-card-three_d_secure-result) for the payment to your evidence details, but we encourage you to include additional details to improve your odds of winning the dispute.\n\n### Custom Radar rules for 3DS and liability shift ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nIf you have [Radar for Fraud Teams](https://stripe.com/radar/fraud-teams), you can [customize your rules](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/rules#request-3d-secure) to control when to request 3DS and how to handle each specific authentication outcome and liability shift. Stripe’s [Strong Customer Authentication](https://stripe.com/guides/strong-customer-authentication) (SCA) rules run automatically and independently of custom Radar rules, and block unauthenticated payments unless exempted.",

    "markdown": "# Best practices for preventing fraud\n\n## Learn how to use best practices to protect against disputes and fraudulent payments.\n\nCreating an effective dispute and fraud prevention strategy that best suits your business can help prevent fraud from occurring. By employing some of these best practices as part of your overall strategy, you can avoid excessive chargebacks and reduce potential customer burden and losses.\n\nThese are tools that any Stripe user—whether or not they’re a developer, and whether or not they use any specialized Stripe tools like [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar \"Radar\")—can leverage to reduce fraud and dispute incidents.\n\n### Be clear and transparent with your customers ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nClear and frequent contact with your customers can help prevent many of the [reasons](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/categories) for disputes. By responding to issues and processing refunds or replacement orders quickly, your customers are far less likely to take the time to dispute a payment. Make your customer service contact information easy to find, keep customers updated throughout their order process, and provide updates about deliveries.\n\n#### Caution\n\nInclude a clear description of your refund and cancellation policies in your terms of service. You can require your users to agree to your terms of service to increase the likelihood that card issuers respect your policies in the event of a dispute.\n\n*   In general, make your terms of service and policies easy to find on your website, and require customers to agree to them. Rather than only linking to them during checkout, provide a full version of them on the checkout page or as a pop-up with a requirement to agree to them prior to submitting the order.\n    \n*   Card issuers can be very specific about how you present your policies. If you have a checkbox your customer must accept that only contains a link, the issuer might reject it as unsatisfactory evidence that your customer was aware of your policies. There must be reasonable evidence that you presented your customer with a full copy of your policies prior to their purchase.\n    \n*   When shipping physical goods to customers, use carriers and services that provide online tracking and delivery confirmation whenever possible. Provide this information to your customers as soon as it’s available (if you need to submit tracking information as dispute evidence, be aware that card issuers don’t follow links so screenshots must be provided).\n    \n*   Use clear statement descriptors\n    \n    Set a recognizable name for your [statement descriptor](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/activate#public-business-information) through your [account settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/account/?support_details=true). We recommend using your website domain or business name to make sure customers can easily identify their purchase when they look at their statement.\n    \n    Statement descriptors are limited to between 5 and 22 characters. They must contain at least 5 letters and can’t use the special characters `<`, `>`, `\\`, `'`, or `\"`.\n    \n*   Separate your business accounts\n    \n    Avoid using the same Stripe account for separate businesses. Each Stripe account should represent a single business, which allows for separate statement descriptors and contact information. If you need to process payments for multiple businesses, create [additional accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/multiple-accounts) for each.\n    \n\n### Consider proactively refunding suspicious payments![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYou should immediately refund any payment you’re [sure is fraud](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/prevention/identifying-fraud) (unless you’re covered by some form of liability shift, such as with [3D Secure](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure/authentication-flow#disputed-payments)). If you know you’re going to receive a fraud dispute on it, you can save yourself the [dispute fee](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/how-disputes-work#dispute-fees), the increase to your [dispute rate](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/measuring#dispute-rate-usage), and the potential loss of product by fully refunding the fraudulent payment.\n\n#### Caution\n\nWhile customers can’t dispute fully refunded payments, they can still dispute partially refunded payments. Card network rules even allow for a payment that has been partially refunded to be disputed for the full payment amount.\n\nHowever, sometimes you might suspect a payment is fraud, but your suspicions fall short of absolute certainty. Sometimes it makes sense to aggressively refund every charge that falls into this gray area and sometimes it doesn’t.\n\nYou might want to pursue an aggressive refund strategy if any of the following apply:\n\n*   **Order not yet fulfilled**. The loss of your product could be prevented by a refund. That is, if you haven’t already committed your product or service in some irreversible way by the time you suspect fraud, you might want to be more aggressive in refunding. Whereas if your product or service was irretrievable—for example, the product already shipped, or the service has already been used—it might make more sense _not_ to refund, and to wait and see if it does turn out to be fraud.\n*   **Excessive disputes**. Your recent dispute activity has been [excessive](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/measuring#excessive-dispute-activity) by card network definitions, which could put your account standing with Stripe at risk or put you at risk of being identified into a chargeback monitoring program.\n*   **Chargeback monitoring program**. You’re already in a [chargeback monitoring program](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/monitoring-programs) and need to exit the program.\n*   **New or small business**. Your business has small enough payment volume (say, fewer than 100 payments per month) that one or two fraud disputes can have a very outsized impact on your [dispute rate](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/measuring#dispute-rate-usage), even if you otherwise have little dispute activity.\n\nIf none of the above apply, you might want to be more conservative with how frequently you proactively refund charges you suspect are fraudulent.\n\n#### Refunding a payment as fraud\n\nTo refund a payment, in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/), select the payment and click **Refund as fraud**. This refunds the payment and reports it as fraudulent to Stripe so that we can further improve our fraud detection.\n\n### Delay shipping orders![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nIf you ship physical goods, consider delaying the shipment by 24-48 hours. This time gives cardholders a chance to spot and report any fraud on their accounts. You would still receive a fraud dispute in this scenario, but at least you wouldn’t also lose the merchandise. Not all cardholders check their statements on a daily basis, however, and their card issuer might not proactively notify them about the transaction.\n\n[Customers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers \"Customers\") that request overnight or expedited shipping should be considered higher risk, as the increased cost of such services is of no consequence to fraudsters. One tactic you can use to identify these types of payments is to offer same day or overnight shipping at a very high cost–many times more expensive than any other shipping option you provide.\n\nIt’s far less likely that any legitimate customer would pay such a high cost, but a fraudster would want the goods to be shipped as soon as possible and have no regard for the additional cost. You can then manually screen any customers that opt for the anomalously expensive shipping option and scrutinize the order to determine if it looks genuine. Using a [separate auth and capture process](#use-auth-and-capture-when-creating-payments) together with [Radar reviews](#manually-review-payments) is a good way to do so.\n\n### Ship to a verified address![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nShipping to a [verified billing address](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/prevention/verification#avs-check) which has passed postal code and street address checks is the safest option. When using an address that hasn’t been verified, you can’t prove that the order was shipped to the legitimate cardholder if the payment is later disputed.\n\nThis doesn’t prevent you shipping to a different address, though you should do all you can to mitigate the risks involved. For instance, you may only want to ship orders to a different address for returning customers you already know to be legitimate, or who provide a fully verifiable billing address. In addition, any of the following could indicate the payment is suspicious:\n\n*   The order is much larger than normal, or is only for your most expensive products\n*   The customer changed the shipping address after placing the order\n*   The customer requested expedited shipping\n*   The products ordered have a high resale value\n*   The shipping destination is different from the billing address or the card’s country of origin (for example, the billing address is in Spain, but the shipping address is in France)\n\nReviewing the order and the shipping address information can help you determine whether or not the order presents an unacceptable risk to you.\n\n### Benchmarking your dispute rate![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYour account’s [dispute rate](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/measuring#dispute-rate-usage) is an important metric to use when reviewing the efficacy of your disputes and fraud prevention methods. You can regularly review these metrics in your Stripe Dashboard to see the impact your dispute prevention strategies are having.\n\n[Radar](https://stripe.com/radar) is a suite of features and tools for fighting fraud that is built into Stripe and requires no additional integration work.\n\n### Manually review payments![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n[Radar for Fraud Teams](https://stripe.com/radar/fraud-teams) includes a [review](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/reviews) feature that allows you to place certain payments into review—though keep in mind that these payments are still processed and the credit card charged, unless you are using a separate auth and capture process. These payments are placed into the [review queue](https://dashboard.stripe.com/radar) for you to take a closer look at. If you suspect the payment is fraudulent, you can refund it.\n\nYou should review payments that Stripe has placed into your [review queue](https://dashboard.stripe.com/radar) as soon as possible. Payments with an [elevated risk](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/risk-evaluation#elevated-risk) of fraud are automatically marked for review. You can also create additional rules to customize the types of payments that should be placed in your review queue.\n\nHere are some considerations when reviewing a payment:\n\n*   Does the billing address match the shipping address?\n*   Has the billing address been verified by AVS? Does it also match the card’s country of origin?\n*   Does the customer’s email address match the cardholder’s name?\n*   Is this an order that the customer has asked to be expedited?\n*   Have multiple orders from different credit cards originated from this same IP address?\n*   Has this customer made many order attempts that have been declined?\n\nIf you’re unsure about a payment when you’re reviewing it, you should always contact the customer by phone or email. If a payment’s billing and shipping address don’t match, look into the shipping address using [Google Maps & Street View](https://www.google.com/maps/streetview) to find out more. A common tactic that fraudsters use is to have orders shipped to a freight or mail forwarding service or storage facility that forwards the goods to their actual location.\n\n### Use Radar rules to automatically block payments or place them in review![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n[Radar for Fraud Teams](https://stripe.com/radar/fraud-teams), is built directly into the payment flow and combines a customizable rules engine with powerful machine learning algorithms. It can detect patterns across payments from every business processing payments with Stripe, assessing the risk of each one.\n\nUsing [rules](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/rules), you can automatically evaluate payments based on your specific detection criteria and take the appropriate action on them. You can also create rules that use multiple criteria, allowing you to allow or block payments that meet multiple conditions. Each business has different risks.\n\n### Country and card type limiting![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nIf you’re experiencing increased fraud coming from certain countries, you can set up rules to block payments from any country you do not want to accept payments from, using the `:ip_country:` and `:card_country:` rule attributes. For example, you can create the following rule to block all payments and cards originating from Canada: `Block if :ip_country: = ca and :card_country: = 'ca'`. Similarly, if your business only supports the country it operates in, you can create a rule that blocks any payments from all other countries. For example, a rule to block payments that don’t originate from Australia is: `Block if :ip_country: != au and :card_country: != 'au'`.\n\nYou can set limits on which type of cards to accept, either by brand, (for example, Mastercard), or by funding type (for example, pre-paid). This can be particularly helpful if you see excessive fraud from certain card types. To block payments from all Visa-issued debit cards, an example rule would be: `Block if :card_brand: = visa and :card_funding: = 'debit'`.\n\nThese are tools that require some development work to implement. If you rely on a [Stripe partner](https://stripe.com/partners) to provide your payments integration, you might not have the ability to directly implement these on your own.\n\n### Process your transactions on Stripe ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nThe [Visa Compelling Evidence 3.0](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/categories#visa-ce-30) rules rely on transaction history to dispute friendly fraud by showing previous non-fraud transactions with the same cardholder within a specified period. When you get a Visa fraud dispute, Stripe can identify qualifying transactions in your history on our platform and pre-populate the dispute response with most of the required evidence you need. You can use this evidence to significantly increase your likelihood of overturning the dispute in your favor.\n\nStripe can’t determine eligibility or submit evidence for externally processed transactions, so we recommend:\n\n*   Using Stripe processing whenever possible\n*   Including the customer IP address, email address, shipping address, and product descriptions in your transactions with Stripe\n\n### Collect as much payment information as possible ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nSome disputes are lost because only the minimum information was required during checkout. This makes it difficult (sometimes impossible) for Stripe or the card issuer to verify that the customer is legitimate. For instance, while a billing postal code isn’t always necessary to process a card payment, including it allows the payment to be verified by the card issuer. If verification fails, consider rejecting the payment because this might indicate fraud.\n\nUse [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout) or [Advanced fraud detection](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/prevention/advanced-fraud-detection) to make sure your integration is best equipped to provide relevant payment information, such as:\n\n*   [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers \"Customers\") name\n*   Customer email address\n*   CVC number\n*   Full billing address and postal code\n*   Shipping address (if different from billing address)\n*   Tracking information\n\n### Implement a cardholder authentication method such as 3D Secure![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n[3D Secure](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure \"3D Secure (3DS)\") is a way to add a verification step between the customer and the card issuer to your checkout flow. Payments that have been authenticated with 3D Secure might be protected from most fraudulent disputes through a rule known as [liability shift](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure/authentication-flow#disputed-payments). You will, however, still receive [Early Fraud Warnings](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/how-disputes-work#early-fraud-warnings) that can count against [card brand monitoring programs](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/monitoring-programs).\n\nLearn more at [Card Authentication and 3D Secure](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure).\n\n### Programmatically verify your customer’s identity![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nFor some, verifying the identity of customers can be beneficial. Consider using [Stripe Identity](https://docs.stripe.com/identity) to verify a government ID and match with a selfie of the document holder. Alternatively, you can ask customers to connect their [Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/overview/) or [LinkedIn](https://developer.linkedin.com/docs/oauth2) accounts as a further proof of identity. This is an extra step that a fraudulent actor might not take. Some legitimate customers might not want to go through this additional step either, and your conversion rate might suffer as a result.\n\n### Use auth and capture when creating payments![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nCredit card charge attempts are processed in two parts. The charge is first _authorized_ by requesting authorization for the amount to charge from the card issuer. After a charge is approved, by default it’s then _captured_ immediately afterwards and the amount deducted from the card.\n\nA [capture later](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/place-a-hold-on-a-payment-method) payment flow (sometimes called “auth and capture”) is the process of performing these two steps at separate times. The authorization can be made first, which holds the amount on the card and appears on a customer’s statement as a pending transaction, but does not actually move money out of their account. The charge can then be captured any time up to 7 days after the authorization. Capturing a charge completes the payment and the funds are deducted from the customer’s card. If a charge isn’t captured within the time limit, the authorization is automatically released.\n\nSimilar to delayed shipping, this method can allow enough time for potential fraud to come to light, giving you the option to carefully review—and potentially refund—the transaction. Cardholders cannot dispute uncaptured authorizations, only fully captured payments. With Radar for Fraud Teams you can manually capture these payments in the [review process](#manually-review-payments).\n\n### Set a custom statement descriptor for each payment![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe statement descriptor is the text that appears on customers’ card statements with information about the company that’s associated with a payment. One way to use a statement descriptor is to insert a short, random code that your customer then has to verify. When you suspect a transaction might be fraudulent, you can contact your customer and ask them to give you the code that is shown on their online statement, and if they do not, you would refund the payment.\n\nYou can either edit your [default statement descriptor](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/public) within the Dashboard or set a [dynamic statement descriptor](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/statement-descriptors#dynamic) whenever a payment is created through the API.\n\nWhile this method can’t help against a fraudster who may have access to a cardholder’s online card issuer or credit account, this is rare. Using the statement descriptor in this manner can provide reassurance that the customer is likely to be genuine. As with some other prevention methods, the added customer friction of this method could lead to some legitimate payments being refunded.",

    "markdown": "# Use the API to respond to disputes\n\n## Learn how to manage disputes programmatically.\n\nYou can respond to disputes in the Stripe Dashboard, where we guide you through submitting the optimal evidence for each [dispute reason](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/categories).\n\nYou can also programmatically manage disputes using the API. With the API, you can upload evidence, respond to disputes, and receive dispute events using webhooks.\n\n## Retrieve a dispute![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nFor details about a dispute, [retrieve](https://docs.stripe.com/api#retrieve_dispute) a `Dispute` object:\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/disputes/{{DISPUTE_ID}} \\   -u` \n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\nThe response contains information about the dispute and any response or evidence that’s already been provided.\n\n`{   object: \"dispute\"   id: \"{{DISPUTE_ID}}\",   charge: \"ch_5Q4BjL06oPWwho\",   evidence: {     customer_name: \"Jane Austen\",     customer_purchase_ip: \"127.0.0.1\",     product_description: \"Widget ABC, color: red\",     shipping_tracking_number: \"Z01234567890\",     uncategorized_text: \"Additional notes and comments\",   },   evidence_details: {     due_by: 1403047735,     submission_count: 1   }   ... }`\n\n## Update a dispute![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYou [update](https://docs.stripe.com/api#update_dispute) the `Dispute` object and pass structured evidence with the `evidence` parameter.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/disputes/{{DISPUTE_ID}} \\   -u` \n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n `\\   -d \"evidence[customer_email_address]\"=\"email@example.com\" \\   -d \"evidence[shipping_date]\"=6/12/2024 \\   -d \"evidence[shipping_documentation]\"=\"{{FILE_ID}}\"`\n\nTo view all available fields for the evidence parameter, see [Dispute evidence](https://docs.stripe.com/api#dispute_evidence_object). There are two types of evidence you can provide, depending on the field being updated:\n\n*   Text-based evidence, such as `customer_email` and `service_date`. These types of evidence take a string of text.\n*   File-based evidence, such as `service_documentation` and `customer_communication`. These take a [file\\_upload](https://docs.stripe.com/api#file_object) object ID.\n\n#### Note\n\nThe combined character count for all text-based evidence field submissions is limited to 150,000.\n\nYou can provide documents or images (for example, a contract or screenshot) as part of dispute evidence using the [File Upload API](https://docs.stripe.com/file-upload). You first upload a document with the purpose of `dispute_evidence`, which generates a `File_upload` object that you can use when submitting evidence. Make sure the file meets [Stripe’s recommendations](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/best-practices#file-upload-recommendations) before uploading it for evidence submission.\n\nIf you’re only interested in submitting a single file or a large amount of plaintext as evidence, use `uncategorized_text` or `uncategorized_file`. However, fill in as many fields as possible so you have the best chance at overturning a dispute.\n\n#### Note\n\n## Multiple disputes on a single payment![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nIt’s not typical, but it’s possible for a customer to dispute the same payment more than once. For example, a customer might partially dispute a payment for one of the items in an order if it was damaged in delivery, and then file a second dispute against a different item in the same order because the item didn’t work properly.\n\nStripe distinguishes all disputes by a unique identifier, regardless of whether they’re related to a single payment. When you [list disputes](https://docs.stripe.com/api#list_disputes), you can filter the results to show only disputes for a particular payment by specifying the `id` of the `PaymentIntent` or `Charge` object and including the [payment\\_intent filter](https://docs.stripe.com/api/disputes/list#list_disputes-charge) or [charge filter](https://docs.stripe.com/api/disputes/list#list_disputes-payment_intent).\n\n`curl -G https://api.stripe.com/v1/disputes \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d payment_intent={{PAYMENT_INTENT_ID}}`\n\nWhen a payment has multiple disputes, use the `id` provided for each returned dispute in the list to make sure you’re responding to the correct dispute by specifying its `id` when you [retrieve](#retrieve-a-dispute) or [update the dispute](#update-a-dispute).",

    "markdown": "# How disputes work | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Learn about the high level lifecycle of payment card disputes.\n\nA dispute occurs when an account owner contacts their bank to contest a payment to you for a number of possible [reasons](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/categories). When someone files a dispute, the process varies slightly across different card networks, but typically follows a standard pattern shown here:\n\n![Disputes lifecycle diagram](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/lifecycle.b60ea78efb3b484b36c415a2b71887e3.png)\n\nWhen an account owner disputes a charge to their payment account, Stripe:\n\n*   Notifies you of the dispute through the Stripe Dashboard, email, [webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks \"webhook\"), and the API\n*   Debits the disputed amount, plus a dispute fee, from your Stripe account\n*   Provides you with an explanation of the dispute and access to the account owner’s claim to their bank\n*   Steps you through the process of submitting convincing evidence to counter the dispute\n\nThroughout this process, Stripe facilitates your case, but doesn’t have influence over the outcome, which is at the sole discretion of the account owner’s bank.\n\n## Before the dispute![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nSometimes, Stripe alerts you to pre-dispute notifications before an actual dispute is filed. Pay attention to these notifications because:\n\n*   You might avoid a dispute entirely with proactive customer service and transaction clarification\n*   Failure to respond in the pre-dispute phase can have negative implications in the formal dispute phase\n\n### Early fraud warnings ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nEarly fraud warnings (EFWs) are messages sourced from Visa TC40 reports and Mastercard SAFE (System to Avoid Fraud Effectively) reports that card issuers on these two networks generate to flag payments they suspect might be fraudulent. The networks require issuers to report fraud, but that requirement doesn’t affect an issuer’s decision whether to initiate a dispute.\n\nAs with any fraud signal, EFWs don’t require any action or response from you. You can proactively [refund the charge](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/prevention/best-practices#consider-proactively-refunding-suspicious-payments) to prevent the cardholder from initiating a dispute, or you might wait and see if a fraud dispute happens. Unless the payment was covered by the [liability shift](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure/authentication-flow#disputed-payments) rule, 80% of EFWs convert into a fraud dispute if you do nothing. If the payment was covered by liability shift, then you might still receive a dispute. In that case, Stripe automatically provides some evidence for you, such as data from [3D Secure](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure \"3D Secure (3DS)\").\n\nAutomatically refunding all EFWs regardless of the likelihood of escalation isn’t a good strategy. If you’re too aggressive in issuing refunds for all EFWs, you’ll inevitably refund some transactions that would never have become disputes.\n\nAll other things being equal, our analysis suggests that the optimal point for issuing a refund on early fraud warnings is on charges that are roughly less than or equal to your [dispute fee](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/how-disputes-work#dispute-fees). It’s probably not worthwhile to refund EFWs on charges more than 35 percent higher than your dispute fee.\n\nProactively refunding a flagged payment doesn’t affect the fraud warning. The only time a refund can prevent a fraud report is when it’s processed as a reversal, which usually happens within 2 hours of the payment capture.\n\n#### Cases where refunding makes more sense\n\nThe main exception to the optimal refund strategy above is if you have reason to worry about the effect of the dispute itself on your business or account.\n\nIf any of the conditions described under the [Best practices for preventing fraud](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/prevention/best-practices#consider-proactively-refunding-suspicious-payments) apply to your situation, it makes sense to more aggressively refund EFWs.\n\nAlthough it’s called an early fraud warning, it’s possible to receive an EFW even after you receive a fraud dispute on a charge. This is generally because the systems the networks use to process EFWs are separate from the systems they use to process disputes, and the two aren’t necessarily in sync.\n\nYou can listen for EFW [webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks \"webhook\") using our [API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/radar/early_fraud_warnings).\n\n### Inquiries![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nSome card networks initiate a preliminary phase before creating a formal dispute and [chargeback](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes \"chargeback\"). Stripe calls this preliminary phase an inquiry, though these are sometimes also called a “retrieval” or a “request for information”.\n\nAmerican Express and Discover are the networks that most often use this phase. Mastercard and Visa don’t use it anymore.\n\nMexico Domestic charges that are disputed across card brands use inquiries before creating a formal dispute. Some disputes might escalate to Unwinnable chargebacks if left unanswered.\n\nDuring the inquiry phase, the cardholder’s bank requests transaction clarification, often because the cardholder doesn’t recognize the transaction description. You can resolve the case without incurring a dispute fee by either providing satisfactory evidence that answers the [dispute type](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/categories) for the inquiry, or by issuing a full refund. Inquiries on partially refunded charges can still escalate to a chargeback.\n\n#### Unwinnable chargebacks\n\nFailing to respond to an inquiry can signal to the issuer your implicit acceptance of the claim, resulting in an escalation to a formal, and **likely unwinnable**, chargeback. Unless you intend to accept financial liability, always respond to inquiries immediately, and make every effort to resolve issues amicably with your customer during this stage.\n\nThe Dashboard payment page describes inquiries as an “inquiry” or “dispute inquiry”, and as a “warning” or “dispute warning” in the API events summary, to mirror the language in the API.\n\nIf an inquiry has been open for 120 days without escalation to a chargeback, Stripe marks it as closed in the Dashboard and API. At this point, you can be confident the card network won’t escalate it—they don’t provide an explicit “win” message for inquiries.\n\n## During the dispute![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nWhether it’s because of an inquiry that escalated, or for some other reason, when an account owner files a formal dispute against a payment, the action initiates a chargeback where the card network pulls the funds for the dispute from your Stripe balance and holds it for the entire duration of the dispute. This might be for the full amount of the charge or a different amount. [Why the debited amount is different from the original payment](#disputed-amount)\n\n### Receiving a dispute![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe initiation of a dispute triggers several processes:\n\n*   The card network debits Stripe for your disputed payment and related dispute fees\n*   Stripe in turn debits your Stripe balance for the disputed amount plus a dispute fee\n*   You can’t issue a refund outside the dispute process while the dispute is open\n*   Your [dispute rate](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/measuring) with that card network increases\n\n### Timing![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nCard networks typically allow cardholders to initiate disputes within 120 days of the original payment, but their rules allow more time in some situations. Certain industries, such as travel or event ticketing—where the payment might be made long before the event occurs—are prone to longer time intervals between the original purchase and a dispute. Generally speaking, when a customer makes a payment for something that will happen in the future (like a vacation reservation, a professional services appointment, or an event ticket), the clock starts on the date of the event, not the date of the payment.\n\nFollowing the creation of the chargeback, you have a limited amount of time (usually 7-21 days, depending on the card network) to respond to the card issuer.\n\nIf you submit evidence, the issuer also has a limited amount of time (usually 60–75 days, depending on the card network) to evaluate the evidence and decide the outcome.\n\nThe full lifecycle of a dispute, from initiation to the final decision from the issuer, can take as long as 2-3 months to complete. There are no actions a business can take to reliably accelerate this timeline, other than to decline to contest the dispute by accepting it in the Dashboard or API.\n\nAt the completion of the dispute process, the issuer either overturns the dispute in your favor or upholds the dispute in their cardholder’s favor.\n\nIf the issuer overturns the dispute, they return the debited chargeback amount to Stripe, and Stripe passes this amount back to you.\n\nIf the issuer upholds the dispute, nothing changes from your perspective and no money moves—Stripe credited the issuer when they initiated the chargeback. The issuer will return the funds to the cardholder at some point during—or even after—this process. The timing of the cardholder’s credit is entirely at the issuer’s discretion.\n\n### Dispute fees![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe dispute fee for your country can be found [on the Stripe Pricing page](https://www.stripe.com/pricing). This fee is deducted from your account balance when a cardholder initiates a dispute.\n\nFor businesses outside Mexico, the dispute fee is nonrefundable. For businesses in Mexico, the dispute fee for a won or withdrawn dispute might be returned.\n\nFor businesses in the [Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_Euro_Payments_Area), cards processed on the [Cartes Bancaires network](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/cartes-bancaires) incur no dispute fee.\n\n### Responding to a dispute![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nIn most cases, you have the ability to challenge a disputed payment, as long as you submit strong evidence to the card issuer that invalidates the dispute claim before the deadline.\n\n**As soon as a dispute is active, the only way to overturn it is by submitting evidence in a response.** Even in cases where your customer claims to have [withdrawn the dispute](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/withdrawing), you must respond with evidence for the dispute to be closed in your favor. Submitting evidence is what signals to the issuer that you don’t accept the dispute and want to have the funds returned to you.\n\nSee [Responding to disputes](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/responding) for information on how to:\n\n*   Review the cardholder’s claim\n*   Evaluate whether to accept or challenge the dispute\n*   Gather appropriate evidence to respond to the dispute\n*   Use the Dashboard or API to submit your response\n\n### Unchallengeable disputes![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYou can’t challenge some types of disputes under the rules of the card network they were processed on. In general, Stripe immediately closes them as lost as soon as we notify you about them, and you have no opportunity to present evidence to the issuer.\n\nThe Dashboard payment page and timeline describes these disputes as those where the card issuer doesn’t allow you to submit evidence.\n\n*   [Inquiries](#inquiries) for Discover cards can turn into unchallengeable disputes if you don’t submit evidence for the inquiry.\n*   The Cartes Bancaires network requires a higher standard of evidence from the cardholder before allowing them to initiate a dispute, but then prohibits you from challenging the dispute. This affects only businesses in the [Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_Euro_Payments_Area) processing payments on the Cartes Bancaires network, and not businesses elsewhere charging cards _issued_ by Cartes Bancaires. Learn more at [Cartes Bancaires](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/cartes-bancaires).\n\n### Receiving multiple disputes per payment ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nIn extremely rare cases, you might receive more than one dispute per payment. This can happen when a customer files a new dispute with a different reason code, for a new line item in the original transaction, on multi-capture payments or simply because the issuer acquired new information about the payment allowing them to refile a dispute.\n\nHandle each dispute the same way as any other dispute; each dispute requires you to either accept or counter the dispute. Pay special attention to the outlined amount, currency, category, and claim details before managing the dispute. [Learn more here](https://support.stripe.com/questions/receiving-multiple-disputes-per-payment-faq).\n\n### Disputed amount![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nA disputed amount might be lower or higher than the amount of the original charge. The following table outlines some of the most common reasons for this difference.\n\n| Scenario | Description | Example |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Currency conversion | If the currency of the payment requires conversion (for example, when the currency of the seller differs from that of the buyer), the conversion rate at the time of the purchase is likely different from the rate at dispute initiation, which causes the converted dispute amount to differ from the original transaction amount. | In January, a purchase from a business based in Ireland for 100 EUR by a customer in the United States converts to a payment on the customer’s USD account of 113.74 USD. In April, the customer disputes the 113.74 USD payment, but the exchange rate has changed, so the 113.74 USD chargeback is now 107.86 EUR to the business instead of the original 100 EUR. |\n| Recurring payments | Sometimes, when an account owner disputes multiple payments within a recurring subscription plan, their bank creates a single dispute for the total amount against one of the charges. This can also happen with non-recurring payments, but is rare. | An account owner disputes three 50 USD recurring charges, but the bank issues a dispute of 150 USD against one of the three payments. |\n| Partial disputes | An account owner disputes only a portion of the total transaction amount. | A purchase of multiple products contains a single damaged item, so the account owner files a dispute to be reimbursed for only that item. |\n| Partially refunded charges | A business partially refunded a payment, but the account owner disputes the entire payment. See our [Disputes on partially refunded payments best practice](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/best-practices#partial-refund-bp) for more information about submitting evidence to counter this kind of dispute. | An account owner contacts a business directly and the business refunds a portion of the original purchase because one of several items in the purchase is damaged. The account owner then disputes the entire purchase amount. |\n\n## After the decision![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nAfter you submit your evidence, the next notification from the card issuer to both Stripe and you is the final decision. Stripe updates the status of the dispute to `won` or `lost` and notifies you through the Stripe Dashboard, email, and any other configured communication channels as soon as the issuer makes its decision clear.\n\nThis outcome is final for all parties. You can’t overturn a lost dispute, but your customer also can’t overturn a dispute decided in your favor. (It should still be possible, even after a loss, for a customer to change their mind and [withdraw the dispute](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/withdrawing).)\n\n#### Arbitration\n\nSome card networks support an arbitration phase for lost disputes that carries a substantial fee of around 500 USD, but Stripe doesn’t support this dispute phase.\n\n* * *",

However, you can’t make a date input wider in the same way that you can `TextField`.\n\n`<DateField   label=\"Date of birth (small)\"   description=\"Enter your birthday\"   size=\"small\" /> <DateField   label=\"Date of birth (medium)\"   description=\"Enter your birthday\"   size=\"medium\" /> <DateField   label=\"Date of birth (large)\"   description=\"Enter your birthday\"   size=\"large\" />`\n\n## Error![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYou can provide an error message to indicate a problem with the date.\n\n`<DateField   label=\"Date of birth\"   description=\"Enter your birthday\"   defaultValue=\"2099-02-31\"   invalid   error=\"Invalid birthday\" />`\n\n## Disabled![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nDisable a `DateField` if the user shouldn’t modify it.\n\n`<DateField   label=\"Date of birth\"   description=\"Enter your birthday\"   defaultValue=\"2011-09-01\"   disabled />`\n\n## Hide elements![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYou can visually hide elements of the `DateField` component, such as the label or description, while maintaining accessibility for screen readers.\n\n`<DateField   label=\"Date of birth\"   description=\"Enter your birthday\"   defaultValue=\"2011-09-01\"   hiddenElements={['description', 'label']} />`\n\n## Events![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe `onChange` prop works similarly to a native `<input type=\"date\" />` HTML element. It only returns a value when it’s a valid date. This means that the `onChange` handler won’t be called on every keystroke, and a `DateField` can’t be a [controlled input](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html#controlled-components).\n\n`<DateField   label=\"Date of birth\"   description=\"Enter your birthday\"   onChange={(e) => {     console.log(e.target.value);   }} />`\n\nEvent props (beginning with `on`) besides `onChange` fire independently for each of the three sections of the `DateField` component: year, month, and day.\n\n`<DateField   label=\"Date of birth\"   description=\"Enter your birthday\"   onFocus={(e) => {     console.log('focus', e);   }}   onBlur={(e) => {     console.log('blur', e);   }}   onKeyPress={(e) => {     console.log('keypress', e);   }}   onKeyDown={(e) => {     console.log('keydown', e);   }}   onKeyUp={(e) => {     console.log('keyup', e);   }} />`",

If the `FormFieldGroup` component is `invalid`, the `invalid` state doesn’t also apply to dependent child controls. Consequently, you must add errors to these child components manually by adding an `invalid` property to them.\n\n`<FormFieldGroup legend=\"Full name\" description=\"Enter your full name\" invalid>   <TextField label=\"First name\" value=\"Tim\" placeholder=\"First name\" hiddenElements={['label']} />   <TextField label=\"Last name\" error=\"Last name missing\" placeholder=\"Last name\" hiddenElements={['label']} /> </FormFieldGroup>`\n\n### Disabled state ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nYou can mark a `FormFieldGroup` component as `disabled`, which disables all the fields within it.

 <LineChart data={sales} x=\"date\" y=\"sold\" color=\"product\" />`\n\n## Axis and value formatting![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nInstead of passing a string for an axis value, you can add richer formatting by passing an object including the `value`, `label` and/or `format` properties.\n\n| Property | Type |\n| --- | --- |\n| `value` | `string \\| number`<br><br>The property name in the data set. Required. |\n| `label` | `string`<br><br>The display text for the axis. |\n| `format` | `object`<br><br>Format a number with one of the [supported currency codes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/unicode-org/cldr/main/common/validity/currency.xml) for example `{currency: 'USD'}`, or a [supported unit](https://tc39.es/proposal-unified-intl-numberformat/section6/locales-currencies-tz_proposed_out.html#sec-issanctionedsimpleunitidentifier) such as `{unit: 'minute'}`. You can also create a compound unit with `-per-` in between, such as `{unit: 'megabyte-per-hour'}`. |\n\n`<LineChart   data={[     {       date: 'January',       sold: 10,     },     {       date: 'February',       sold: 41,     },     {       date: 'March',       sold: 22,     },     {       date: 'April',       sold: 38,     },   ]}   x=\"date\"   y={{value: 'sold', label: 'Price', format: {currency: 'USD'}}} />`\n\n## Domain![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nTo set the minimum and maximum values of an axis, use the `domain` prop. For example, if you always want the `y` axis to go from 0 to 10 (rather than automatically adjusting to the data provided), add the `domain` property to your configuration:\n\n`const sales = [   {     date: 'Jan',     sold: 1,   },   {     date: 'Feb',     sold: 4,   },   {     date: 'Mar',     sold: 2,   },   {     date: 'Apr',     sold: 3,   }, ];  <LineChart   data={sales}   x=\"date\"   y={{value: 'sold', label: 'Sold', domain: [0, 10]}} />`",

    "markdown": "# Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\nYou can define a specialized settings view to let users change specific details about how the app works with their account. For example, an app that uses a third-party API like Zendesk could use `SettingsView` to authorize a user with their Zendesk account. For more details, learn how to [add a settings page](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/app-settings) for your app.\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/settingsview.ca0e43bcc311ea9819da61b2949e6ed1.png)\n\nWhat SettingsView looks like\n\n`SettingsView` is a view root component, just like `ContextView`, containing all other UI elements. It’s the only view that isn’t tied to a specific object, but tied instead to the `settings` viewport. The `settings` viewport maps to predefined locations in the Dashboard, outside of the app drawer.\n\n`SettingsView` renders on the app settings page in the Dashboard after you upload an app. While previewing your app locally, you can preview the `SettingsView` in the Dashboard at [https://dashboard.stripe.com/apps/settings-preview](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apps/settings-preview).\n\nTo use `SettingsView`, you must add a view with the `settings` viewport to your app manifest. An application with a settings view would have an app manifest with a `ui_extension` field that would look something like this:\n\n`{   ...,   \"ui_extension\": {     \"views\": [       ...,       {         \"viewport\": \"settings\",         \"component\": \"AppSettings\"       }     ],   } }`\n\n### SettingsView props![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n| Property | Type |\n| --- | --- |\n| `children` | Required<br><br>`React.ReactNode`<br><br>The contents of the component. |\n| `onSave` | Optional<br><br>`((values: {[key: string]: string}) => void) \\| undefined`<br><br>If provided, a “Save” button will be rendered with the SettingsView.

Refresh tokens are also rolled on every exchange, so the expiration time for the new refresh tokens is always a year from the date that it was generated or rolled. If you exchange a refresh token for an access token within one year, you should never hit the refresh token expiration date.\n\nHere is the equivalent `curl` command to exchange the access token for a refresh token using your secret key:\n\n`curl -X POST https://api.stripe.com/v1/oauth/token \\   -u sk_live_***: \\   -d refresh\\_token={{ REFRESH_TOKEN }} \\   -d grant_type=refresh_token`\n\nHere’s an example response.\n\n`{   \"access_token\": \"{{ ACCESS_TOKEN }}”,   \"livemode\": true,   \"refresh\\_token\": \"{{ REFRESH_TOKEN }}”,   \"scope\": \"stripe_apps\",   \"stripe_publishable_key\": \"pk_live_***”,   \"stripe\\_user\\_id\": \"acct\\_***”,   \"token_type\": \"bearer\" }`\n\nYou’ll get a new refresh token and the previous refresh token expires. You must securely store the refresh token in your backend and use the refresh token to obtain a fresh access token anytime you want to access the Stripe API on behalf of the Stripe User.\n\n#### Common mistake\n\nWhen you refresh the access token you may see an error that says you do not have the required permissions. If you see this, confirm that you’re using the secret key for your account to authorize the API call and that you’re not accidentally using a refresh token, access token, or a restricted key.\n\nYou can verify the access token by making a request to the Stripe API. For example:\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/customers \\  -u \"{{ ACCESS_TOKEN }}\"`",

This document details the tools that we include and how to modify them (if desired) to suit your app.\n\n## Type checking ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nApps come with [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) support, and all of the supporting packages we ship have type definitions to aid development. Typescript warnings display in supported code editors automatically, but you can also check your code using the command line:\n\nYour app’s root directory has a `tsconfig.json` file that extends our recommended configuration in the `@stripe/ui-extension-tools` package. Most developers won’t need to modify this file, but advanced users can add their own properties or even remove the `extends` property and create their own Typescript configuration.\n\nTo enable image imports, we include a `ui-extensions.d.ts` type definition file that references type definitions from the `@stripe/ui-extension-tools` package. We don’t recommend removing this file because it’s a helpful indicator of what image types our CLI can process.\n\n## Linting ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nLinting (checking code for syntax and formatting errors) is an invaluable developer tool, and apps come with an [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) configuration. We include best-practice linter rules and also Stripe-specfic rules to prevent common mistakes. Linting warnings display in supported code editors automatically, but you can also check your code using the command line:\n\nThe ESLint configuration is in the `package.json` file in the `eslintConfig` property. It extends the configuration in the `@stripe/ui-extension-tools` package. Most developers won’t need to modify this configuration, but advanced users can add their own properties or even remove the `extends` property and create their own set of linting rules.\n\n## Testing ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nApp developers can [write unit tests](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/ui-testing) for their React components and utility functions using the bundled test harness built with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).

Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts [form-encoded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POST_(HTTP)#Use_for_submitting_web_forms) request bodies, returns [JSON-encoded](http://www.json.org/) responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.\n\nYou can use the Stripe API in test mode, which doesn’t affect your live data or interact with the banking networks. The API key you use to [authenticate](https://docs.stripe.com/api/authentication) the request determines whether the request is live mode or test mode.\n\nThe Stripe API doesn’t support bulk updates. You can work on only one object per request.\n\nThe Stripe API differs for every account as we release new [versions](https://docs.stripe.com/api/versioning) and tailor functionality. [Log in](https://dashboard.stripe.com/login?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.stripe.com%2Fapi) to see docs with your test key and data.\n\n## Not a developer?\n\nUse Stripe’s [no-code options](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/no-code) or apps from [our partners](https://stripe.partners/) to get started with Stripe and to do more with your Stripe account—no code required.\n\nClient Libraries\n\n$`npm install --save stripe`\n\n## [Authentication](https://docs.stripe.com/api/authentication)\n\nThe Stripe API uses [API keys](https://docs.stripe.com/keys) to authenticate requests. You can view and manage your API keys in [the Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/login?redirect=/apikeys).\n\nTest mode secret keys have the prefix `sk_test_` and live mode secret keys have the prefix `sk_live_`. Alternatively, you can use [restricted API keys](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#limit-access) for granular permissions.\n\nYour API keys carry many privileges, so be sure to keep them secure! Do not share your secret API keys in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, and so forth.\n\nUse your API key by setting it in the initial configuration of `stripe`. The Node.js library will then automatically send this key in each request.\n\nYou can also set a per-request key with an option. This is often useful for Connect applications that use multiple API keys during the lifetime of a process. Methods on the returned object reuse the same API key.\n\nAll API requests must be made over [HTTPS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Secure). Calls made over plain HTTP will fail. API requests without authentication will also fail.\n\n```\nconst Stripe = require('stripe');const stripe = Stripe('sk_test_4eC39Hq...arjtT1zdp7dcsk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc');\n```\n\n```\nvar charge = await stripe.charges.retrieve(  'ch_3LiiC52eZvKYlo2C1da66ZSQ',  {    apiKey: 'sk_test_4eC39Hq...arjtT1zdp7dcsk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc'  });\n```\n\nYour API Key\n\nA sample test API key is included in all the examples here, so you can test any example right away. Do not submit any personally identifiable information in requests made with this key.\n\nTo test requests using your account, replace the sample API key with your actual API key or [sign in](https://dashboard.stripe.com/login?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.stripe.com%2Fapi).\n\n## [Connected Accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/api/connected-accounts)\n\nTo act as connected accounts, clients can issue requests using the `Stripe-Account` special header. Make sure that this header contains a Stripe account ID, which usually starts with the `acct_` prefix.\n\nThe value is set per-request as shown in the adjacent code sample. Methods on the returned object reuse the same account ID.\n\n*   Related guide: [Making API calls for connected accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/authentication)\n\n```\nstripe.charges.retrieve('ch_3LmjSR2eZvKYlo2C1cPZxlbL', {  stripeAccount: 'acct_1032D82eZvKYlo2C'});\n```\n\n## [Errors](https://docs.stripe.com/api/errors)\n\nStripe uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. In general: Codes in the `2xx` range indicate success. Codes in the `4xx` range indicate an error that failed given the information provided (e.g., a required parameter was omitted, a charge failed, etc.). Codes in the `5xx` range indicate an error with Stripe’s servers (these are rare).\n\nSome `4xx` errors that could be handled programmatically (e.g., a card is [declined](https://docs.stripe.com/declines)) include an [error code](https://docs.stripe.com/error-codes) that briefly explains the error reported.\n\n### Attributes\n\n*   The type of error returned. One of `api_error`, `card_error`, `idempotency_error`, or `invalid_request_error`\n    \n    Possible enum values\n    \n    |     |\n    | --- |\n    | `api_error` |\n    | `card_error` |\n    | `idempotency_error` |\n    | `invalid_request_error` |\n    \n*   For some errors that could be handled programmatically, a short string indicating the [error code](https://docs.stripe.com/error-codes) reported.\n    \n*   #### \n    \n    decline\\_codenullable string\n    \n*   A human-readable message providing more details about the error. For card errors, these messages can be shown to your users.\n    \n*   If the error is parameter-specific, the parameter related to the error. For example, you can use this to display a message near the correct form field.\n    \n*   #### \n    \n    payment\\_intentnullable object\n    \n\n### More\n\n*   #### \n    \n    payment\\_method\\_typenullable string\n    \n\n*   #### \n    \n    request\\_log\\_urlnullable string\n    \n*   #### \n    \n    setup\\_intentnullable object\n    \n\n*   #### \n    \n    payment\\_methodnullable object\n    \n\nHTTP Status Code Summary\n\n|     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 200 | OK  | Everything worked as expected. |\n| 400 | Bad Request | The request was unacceptable, often due to missing a required parameter. |\n| 401 | Unauthorized | No valid API key provided. |\n| 402 | Request Failed | The parameters were valid but the request failed. |\n| 403 | Forbidden | The API key doesn’t have permissions to perform the request. |\n| 404 | Not Found | The requested resource doesn’t exist. |\n| 409 | Conflict | The request conflicts with another request (perhaps due to using the same idempotent key). |\n| 429 | Too Many Requests | Too many requests hit the API too quickly. We recommend an exponential backoff of your requests. |\n| 500, 502, 503, 504 | Server Errors | Something went wrong on Stripe’s end. (These are rare.) |\n\nError Types\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| `api_error` | API errors cover any other type of problem (e.g., a temporary problem with Stripe’s servers), and are extremely uncommon. |\n| `card_error` | Card errors are the most common type of error you should expect to handle. They result when the user enters a card that can’t be charged for some reason. |\n| `idempotency_error` | Idempotency errors occur when an `Idempotency-Key` is re-used on a request that does not match the first request’s API endpoint and parameters. |\n| `invalid_request_error` | Invalid request errors arise when your request has invalid parameters. |\n\n## [Handling errors](https://docs.stripe.com/api/errors/handling)\n\nOur Client libraries raise exceptions for many reasons, such as a failed charge, invalid parameters, authentication errors, and network unavailability. We recommend writing code that gracefully handles all possible API exceptions.\n\n*   Related guide: [Error Handling](https://docs.stripe.com/error-handling)\n\n```\n// Note: Node.js API does not throw exceptions, and instead prefers the// asynchronous style of error handling described below.//// An error from the Stripe API or an otherwise asynchronous error// will be available as the first argument of any Stripe method's callback:// E.g. stripe.customers.create({...}, function(err, result) {});//// Or in the form of a rejected promise.// E.g. stripe.customers.create({...}).then(//        function(result) {},//        function(err) {}//      );switch (err.type) {  case 'StripeCardError':    // A declined card error    err.message; // => e.g. \"Your card's expiration year is invalid.\"    break;  case 'StripeRateLimitError':    // Too many requests made to the API too quickly    break;  case 'StripeInvalidRequestError':    // Invalid parameters were supplied to Stripe's API    break;  case 'StripeAPIError':    // An error occurred internally with Stripe's API    break;  case 'StripeConnectionError':    // Some kind of error occurred during the HTTPS communication    break;  case 'StripeAuthenticationError':    // You probably used an incorrect API key    break;  default:    // Handle any other types of unexpected errors    break;}\n```",

    "markdown": "# Error handling | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Catch and respond to declines, invalid data, network problems, and more.\n\nStripe offers many kinds of errors. They can reflect external events, like declined payments and network interruptions, or code problems, like invalid API calls.\n\nTo handle errors, use some or all of the techniques in the table below. No matter what technique you use, you can follow up with our [recommended responses for each error type](#error-types).\n\n| Technique | Purpose | When needed |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| [Catch exceptions](#catch-exceptions) | Recover when an API call can’t continue | Always |\n| [Monitor webhooks](#monitor-webhooks) | React to notifications from Stripe | Sometimes |\n| [Get stored information about failures](#use-stored-information) | Investigate past problems and support other techniques | Sometimes |\n\n## Catch exceptions ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nIf an immediate problem prevents an API call from continuing, the Stripe Node.js library can raise an exception. It’s a best practice to catch and handle exceptions. To enable exception raising and catch the exception, do the following: raising and catch the exception, you need to do several things:\n\n*   If you make the API call in a function, precede the function definition with the `async` keyword.\n*   Precede the API call itself with the `await` keyword.\n*   Wrap the API call in a `try`/`catch` block.\n\nWhen you catch an exception, you can [use its type attribute to choose a response](#error-types).\n\n`const stripe = require('stripe')(`\n\n`'sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc'`\n\n``);  async function exampleFunction(args) {   try {     const paymentIntent = await stripe.paymentIntents.create(args);     console.log('No error.');   } catch (e) {     switch (e.type) {       case 'StripeCardError':         console.log(`A payment error occurred: ${e.message}`);         break;       case 'StripeInvalidRequestError':         console.log('An invalid request occurred.');         break;       default:         console.log('Another problem occurred, maybe unrelated to Stripe.');         break;     }   } }``\n\nAfter setting up exception handling, test it on a variety of data, including [test cards](https://docs.stripe.com/testing), to simulate different payment outcomes.\n\n`exampleFunction({   // The required parameter currency is missing   amount: 2000,   confirm: true,   payment_method:` \n\n`'pm_card_visa'`\n\n`, })`\n\n`An invalid request occurred.`\n\n## Monitor webhooks![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nStripe notifies you about many kinds of problems using [webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks \"webhook\"). This includes problems that don’t follow immediately after an API call. For example:\n\n*   You lose a dispute.\n*   A recurring payment fails after months of success.\n*   Your frontend [confirms](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/confirm \"confirm\") a payment, but goes offline before finding out the payment fails. (The backend still receives webhook notification, even though it wasn’t the one to make the API call.)\n\nYou don’t need to handle every webhook event type. In fact, some integrations don’t handle any.\n\nIn your webhook handler, start with the basic steps from the [webhook builder](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks/quickstart): get an event object and use the event type to find out what happened. Then, if the event type indicates an error, follow these extra steps:\n\n1.  Access [event.data.object](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/object#event_object-data-object) to retrieve the affected object.\n2.  [Use stored information](#use-stored-information) on the affected object to gain context, including an error object.\n3.  [Use its type to choose a response](#error-types).\n\n`const stripe = require('stripe')(`\n\n`'sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc'`\n\n``); const express = require('express'); const app = express();  app.post('/webhook', express.json({type: 'application/json'}), (request, response) => {    // Get an event object   const event = request.body;    // Use its type to find out what happened   if (event.type == 'payment_intent.payment_failed') {      // Get the object affected     const paymentIntent = event.data.object;      // Use stored information to get an error object     const error = paymentIntent.error;      // Use its type to choose a response     switch (error.type) {       case 'StripeCardError':         console.log(`A payment error occurred: ${error.message}`);         break;       case 'StripeInvalidRequestError':         console.log('An invalid request occurred.');         if (error.param) {           console.log(`The parameter ${error.param} is invalid or missing.`);         }         break;       default:         console.log('Another problem occurred, maybe unrelated to Stripe.');         break;     }   }   response.send(); });  app.listen(4242, () => console.log('Running on port 4242'));``\n\nTo test how your integration responds to webhook events, you can [trigger webhook events locally](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks#test-webhook). After completing the setup steps at that link, trigger a failed payment to see the resulting error message.\n\n`stripe trigger payment_intent.payment_failed`\n\n`A payment error occurred: Your card was declined.`\n\n## Get stored information about failures ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nMany objects store information about failures. That means that if something already went wrong, you can retrieve the object and examine it to learn more. In many cases, stored information is in the form of an error object, and you can [use its type to choose a response](#error-types).\n\nFor instance:\n\n1.  Retrieve a specific payment intent.\n2.  Check if it experienced a payment error by determining if [last\\_payment\\_error](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-last_payment_error) is empty.\n3.  If it did, log the error, including its type and the affected object.\n\n`const stripe = require('stripe')(`\n\n`\"sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc\"`\n\n``);  const payment_intent = await stripe.paymentIntents.retrieve(  '{{PAYMENT_INTENT_ID}}'  )  const e = payment_intent.last_payment_error  if (e !== null) {   console.log(`PaymentIntent ${payment_intent.id} experienced a ${e.type} error.`) }``\n\nHere are common objects that store information about failures.\n\nTo test code that uses stored information about failures, you often need to simulate failed transactions. You can often do this using [test cards](https://docs.stripe.com/testing) or test bank numbers. For example:\n\n*   [Simulate a declined payment](https://docs.stripe.com/testing#declined-payments), for creating failed Charges, PaymentIntents, SetupIntents, and so on.\n*   [Simulate a failed payout](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/testing#account-numbers).\n*   [Simulate a failed refund](https://docs.stripe.com/testing#refunds).\n\n## Types of error and responses ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nIn the Stripe Node.js library, each error object has a `type` attribute. Use the documentation for each type for advice about how to respond.\n\n| Name | Type | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Payment error | [StripeCardError](#payment-errors) | An error occurred during a payment, involving one of these situations:<br><br>*   [Payment blocked for suspected fraud](#payment-blocked)<br>*   [Payment declined by the issuer](#payment-declined).<br>*   [Other payment errors](#other-payment-errors). |\n| Invalid request error | [StripeInvalidRequestError](#invalid-request-errors) | You made an API call with the wrong parameters, in the wrong state, or in an invalid way. |\n| Connection error | [StripeConnectionError](#connection-errors) | There was a network problem between your server and Stripe. |\n| API error | [StripeAPIError](#api-errors) | Something went wrong on Stripe’s end. (These are rare.) |\n| Authentication error | [StripeAuthenticationError](#authentication-errors) | Stripe can’t authenticate you with the information provided. |\n| Idempotency error | [StripeIdempotencyError](#idempotency-errors) | You used an [idempotency key](https://docs.stripe.com/api/idempotent_requests) for something unexpected, like replaying a request but passing different parameters. |\n| Permission error | [StripePermissionError](#permission-errors) | The API key used for this request does not have the necessary permissions. |\n| Rate limit error | [StripeRateLimitError](#rate-limit-errors) | You made too many API calls in too short a time. |\n| Signature verification error | [StripeSignatureVerificationError](#signature-verification-errors) | You’re using [webhook](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks \"webhook\") [signature verification](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks#verify-events) and couldn’t verify that a webhook event is authentic. |\n\n## Payment errors ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nPayment errors—sometimes called “card errors” for historical reasons—cover a wide range of common problems. They come in three categories:\n\n*   [Payment blocked for suspected fraud](#payment-blocked)\n*   [Payment declined by the issuer](#payment-declined)\n*   [Other payment errors](#other-payment-errors)\n\nTo distinguish these categories or get more information about how to respond, consult the [error code](https://docs.stripe.com/error-codes), [decline code](https://docs.stripe.com/declines/codes), and [charge outcome](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/object#charge_object-outcome).\n\n(To find the charge outcome from an error object, first get the [Payment Intent that’s involved](https://docs.stripe.com/api/errors#errors-payment_intent) and the [latest Charge it created](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-latest_charge). See the example below for a demonstration.)\n\n`const stripe = require('stripe')(`\n\n`'sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc'`\n\n`);  async function exampleFunction(args) {     try {       const paymentIntent = await stripe.paymentIntents.create(args);     } catch (e) {       console.log(e)       const charge = await stripe.charges.retrieve(e.payment_intent.latest_charge)       if (e.type === 'StripeCardError') {         if (charge.outcome.type === 'blocked') {           console.log('Payment blocked for suspected fraud.')         } else if (e.code === 'card_declined') {           console.log('Payment declined by the issuer.')         } else if (e.code === 'expired_card') {           console.log('Card expired.')         } else {           console.log('Other card error.')         }       }     }   }`\n\nUsers on API version [2022-08-01](https://docs.stripe.com/upgrades#2022-08-01) or older:\n\n(To find the charge outcome from an error object, first get the [Payment Intent that’s involved](https://docs.stripe.com/api/errors#errors-payment_intent) and the [latest Charge it created](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-charges-data). See the example below for a demonstration.)\n\n`const stripe = require('stripe')(`\n\n`'sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc'`\n\n`);  async function exampleFunction(args) {     try {       const paymentIntent = await stripe.paymentIntents.create(args);     } catch (e) {       console.log(e)       if (e.type === 'StripeCardError') {         if (e.payment_intent.charges.data[0].outcome.type === 'blocked') {           console.log('Payment blocked for suspected fraud.')         } else if (e.code === 'card_declined') {           console.log('Payment declined by the issuer.')         } else if (e.code === 'expired_card') {           console.log('Card expired.')         } else {           console.log('Other card error.')         }       }     }   }`\n\nYou can trigger some common kinds of payment error with test cards. Consult these lists for options:\n\n*   [Simulating payments blocked for fraud risk](https://docs.stripe.com/testing#fraud-prevention)\n*   [Simulating declined payments and other card errors](https://docs.stripe.com/testing#declined-payments)\n\nThe test code below demonstrates a few possibilities.\n\n`exampleFunction({   currency: 'usd',   amount: 2000,   confirm: true,   payment_method:` \n\n`'pm_card_radarBlock'`\n\n`, })`\n\n`Payment blocked for suspected fraud.`\n\n### Payment blocked for suspected fraud ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Type** | `StripeCardError` |\n| **Codes** | `const charge = await stripe.charges.retrieve(e.payment_intent.latest_charge) charge.outcome.type === 'blocked'` |\n| **Codes** | `e.payment_intent.charges.data[0].outcome.type === 'blocked'` |\n| **Problem** | Stripe’s fraud prevention system, [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar \"Radar for Fraud Teams\"), blocked the payment |\n| **Solutions** | This error can occur when your integration is working correctly.

If you don’t have a Stripe account yet, [register](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register) online.\n\n## Install the Stripe Adobe Commerce app ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nUse Stripe Apps to bolster security and simplify the use of distinct restricted keys for each integration with your Stripe account. The process of installing the Stripe App and acquiring the newly generated secret and publishable [keys](https://docs.stripe.com/keys) is essential for your integration with the Adobe Commerce connector. This approach eliminates the need to manually create your own restricted key or use a secret key. To integrate the Adobe Commerce app and reinforce your account’s security infrastructure:\n\n1.  Navigate to the [Stripe App Marketplace](https://marketplace.stripe.com/), then click [Install the Adobe Commerce app](https://marketplace.stripe.com/apps/install/link/com.stripe.AdobeCommerce).\n2.  Select the Stripe account where you want to install the app.\n3.  Review and approve the app permissions, install the app in test mode or live mode, then click **Install**.\n4.  After you install the app, store the keys in a safe place where you won’t lose them. To help yourself remember where you stored it, you can [leave a note on the key in the Dashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#reveal-an-api-secret-key-live-mode).\n5.  Use the newly generated publishable key and secret key to finish the Connector configuration.\n6.  To manage the app or generate new security keys after installation, navigate to the application settings page in [test mode](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/settings/apps/com.stripe.AdobeCommerce) or [live mode](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/apps/com.stripe.AdobeCommerce).\n\n## General settings ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\n*   **Mode:** We recommend that you start by testing the integration in [test mode](https://docs.stripe.com/test-mode \"test mode\"). Switch to live mode when you’re ready to accept live transactions. You can learn more about [testing payments](https://docs.stripe.com/testing) on Stripe.\n*   **API keys:** Fill in the test and live keys that Stripe provides to you in the [Adobe Commerce app](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/settings/apps/com.stripe.AdobeCommerce).\n*   **Hold Elevated Risk Orders:** If Stripe [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar \"Radar\") marks a payment with an `Elevated Risk` status, the module places the order `On Hold` until you review the payment. See the section [Enabling fraud prevention features with Stripe Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/adobe-commerce#radar) for additional details.\n*   **Receipt Emails:** When enabled, Stripe sends a payment receipt email to the customer after the payment succeeds. You can customize the styles and brand of emails from your Stripe account settings.\n\n## Payments ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\n*   **Enabled:** Enable or disable Stripe as an available payment method for the standard checkout page, for the multi-shipping checkout page, and for the admin area.\n*   **Payment flow:** Select your preferred payment flow for the standard checkout page. With the embedded payment flow, we embed an iframe-based Payment Element directly in the checkout page. With the redirect payment flow, we redirect customers to Stripe Checkout to complete their payment.\n*   **Form layout:** Display the payment method selector in Horizontal layout (tabs), or Vertical layout (accordion). We recommend the Vertical layout for narrow sections, such as on mobile or 3-column checkout pages. You can test the two layouts in the PaymentElement’s interactive [UI component](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-element).\n*   **Title:** The label you want to display to the customer on the checkout page.\n*   **Payment method configuration:** Stripe supports [multiple configurations](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-method-configurations) of payment methods. After you [configure the payment methods](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods), they immediately become available in the dropdown field. You can select a different configuration for each of your store views, based on business requirements.\n*   **Payment Action:** Select a payment mode:\n    *   **Authorize and Capture**: Charge customer cards immediately after a purchase.\n    *   **Authorize Only**: Authorize the payment amount and place a hold on the card. You can capture the amount later [by issuing an invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/adobe-commerce/admin#capturing-later).\n    *   **Order**: Save the customer’s payment method without attempting an authorization or capture. You can collect payment for an order processed in this mode by issuing an invoice from the administrative area.\n*   **Expired authorizations:** For card payments that you don’t capture immediately, you must do so within seven days. Any attempt to capture the amount after that returns an error. By enabling this option, the module attempts to recreate the original payment with the original card used for that order. The module saves cards automatically in **Authorize Only** mode and the customer can’t delete them from their account section until you either invoice or cancel the order.\n*   **Automatic Invoicing:** The Authorize Only option creates a new invoice with a Pending status on checkout. After capturing the charge, the invoice status transitions to Paid. This option is useful when Payment Action is set to Authorize Only: no invoice results from completing the checkout flow. If enabled, the module automatically generates an invoice on checkout completion so you can email it to a customer before charging them.\n*   **Save customer payment method** Enable this option to allow customers to save their last used payment method in the Stripe vault and reuse it later for quicker checkout.\n*   **Card Icons:** Display card icons based on the card brands your Stripe account supports.\n*   **Optional Statement Descriptor:** This is an optional short description for the source of the payment, shown in the customer’s bank statements. If left empty, the default descriptor configured from your Stripe Dashboard applies. This option isn’t available for Multibanco, SEPA Direct Debit, or Sofort.\n*   **Sort Order:** If you’ve enabled multiple payment methods, this setting determines the order of payment methods presented on the checkout page.\n\n## Express Checkout ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nExpress Checkout lets customers place orders using one-click wallet buttons like [Link](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link/what-is-link), [Apple Pay](https://docs.stripe.com/apple-pay), and [Google Pay](https://docs.stripe.com/google-pay). If supported by the customer’s device, you can display multiple wallets in any order. Set your preferences in the dedicated configuration section of the Adobe Commerce admin panel.\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/connector-express-checkout.c3e09ee826a5d1659bda4bba38492e75.png)\n\nConfiguration options for Apple Pay and Google Pay\n\n*   **Enabled:** Toggles the wallet button as an available payment method for chosen locations. You can turn it on even if regular payments are disabled.\n*   **Locations:** Specify the pages where you want the wallet buttons to appear.\n*   **Seller name:** Your business name, which is displayed in the payment modal.\n*   **Button height:** You can modify the button height to match the **Add to Cart** and **Proceed to Checkout** buttons in your theme.\n*   **Sort order:** By default, Stripe arranges wallets in an optimal order based on factors like device capabilities and usage patterns. You can assign a sort order to each wallet in its sub-configuration section by selecting **Use sort order field**.\n\nIf you enable Express Checkout and the wallet buttons don’t appear, refer to the [troubleshooting page](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/adobe-commerce/troubleshooting#wallet-button).\n\n## Webhooks ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nStripe uses webhooks to notify your application when an event happens in your account. Webhooks are particularly useful for updating Magento orders when a customer’s bank confirms or declines a payment, or when collecting subscription payments. These events allow the module to mark Magento orders as ready for fulfilment, record refunds against them, or add comments about payment failure reasons.\n\nStarting from version 3 of the module, you no longer need to manually configure webhooks. The module checks and potentially configures webhooks automatically in the following cases:\n\n*   When you install or upgrade the module and trigger the `setup:upgrade` command.\n*   Every time you update the API keys in the Magento admin.\n*   Every time you change the URL of a store in the Magento admin.\n*   When the module detects a change in the database during one of the hourly automated checks. This prevents webhooks from being broken due to a manual change to the database, a migration from a different server, or a backup restoration.\n\nWhen updating webhooks, the module creates a single webhook endpoint per Stripe account. For example, if you have five store views, four are using a Stripe account and the last one is using a different Stripe account, the module creates two webhook endpoints.\n\nThis also applies if you use different domain names for your store views. In this case, the module uses one of the store view domains and not your base URL. This is to prevent issues with base URLs often being behind a firewall for security reasons.\n\nThe module uses webhook signatures to verify that the events were sent by Stripe, not by a third party. You can disable this protection only when your Magento instance is using developer mode.",

Go to **Sales > Orders** to find the order you want to refund.\n2.  If you set _Payment Action_ to _Authorize Only_, the only action you need to take is to press the **Cancel** button at the top of the page. However, if you chose to _Authorize and Capture_, proceed to the next step.\n3.  From the left sidebar, click **Invoices**, then click on the [invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices \"invoices\") to refund it.\n4.  At the top right-hand corner, click **Credit Memo**.\n5.  Adjust the amount (if necessary) and click **Refund** at the bottom of the page to perform a live refund. By clicking **Refund Offline**, you only issue the refund in Adobe Commerce and not in Stripe.\n\n1.  For a partial refund, you can adjust the **Adjustment Fee**. This is the amount you don’t want to refund. In the screenshot above, by setting the adjustment fee to 10 USD, we’re refunding 53.87 USD and 10 USD is kept as a fee. You can ignore the **Adjustment Refund** field because we won’t refund an amount that is greater than the original payment of the customer.\n\nThe amount is now fully or partially refunded in Stripe and a note appears in the **Comments History** of the order.\n\n## Authorizing card payments and capturing later ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nIn your [card settings](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/adobe-commerce/configuration#payments), you can set **Payment Action** to only authorize card payments when placing an order. The bank guarantees the amount and holds it on the customer’s card for up to 7 days. Failure to capture the payment by this time cancels the authorization and releases the funds.\n\nOptionally, you can set **Expired Authorizations** to attempt to re-authorize the payment in case you miss the 7-day window but it isn’t guaranteed to succeed.\n\nWhen ready to capture (for example, you shipped the product), follow these steps:\n\n1.  Go to **Sales > Orders**.\n2.  Find the relevant order.\n3.  Click **Invoice**.\n4.  If you need to issue a partial invoice, adjust the invoice items as shown in the video below. You can reduce the item quantity but not increase it.\n5.  Click **Submit Invoice** to capture and finalize the payment.\n\nAfter clicking **Submit Invoice**, you can see the captured funds in the Stripe Dashboard.\n\n## Creating orders![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYou can create an order and charge a customer’s card with details that you’ve received over the phone, directly from the Adobe Commerce admin panel:\n\n1.  Go to **Sales > Orders**.\n2.  At the top right hand side, click **Create New Order**.\n3.  Choose a customer, the store, and any products for that order.\n4.  Select a shipping method (if applicable) before filling in payment details.\n5.  When you’re ready to submit the order, select a saved payment method. Clicking the **Add new** button redirects you to the customer page in Stripe, where you can securely enter a new payment method.\n6.  Click **Submit Order**.\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/admin-create-orders.be0947d1846510897ad2fa16e62c72ab.png)\n\nPayment information for admin orders\n\nIf you set **Payment Action** to authorize and capture, we charge the card immediately. If you set **Payment Action** to authorize only, you must also [capture the payment](#capturing-later).\n\n## Send an invoice to the customer![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nWhen creating a new order from your Adobe Commerce admin, you have the option to send an invoice link to the customer by email:\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/admin-send-invoice.ac36fd329e005e4310d379702bcece25.png)\n\nSend an invoice to the customer\n\nYou can change the due date to help keeping track of late payments in your Stripe Dashboard.\n\nUsing this method is more secure than paying by card from the Admin Panel as you avoid collecting sensitive payment information over the phone. By opening the link in the email, the customer opens a [Hosted Invoice Page](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/hosted-invoice-page) which includes a payment form.",

    "markdown": "# Troubleshooting for Adobe Commerce | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Learn how to troubleshoot the Stripe Connector for Adobe Commerce.\n\nUse this guide to troubleshoot the Stripe Connector for Adobe Commerce.\n\n## Installation issues ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nThe most common issue during the installation process is getting the following error when using Composer:\n\n`Composer package not found: Could not find a matching version of package stripe/stripe-payments`\n\nIf you encounter this problem, follow these steps:\n\n1.  Order the module from the [Adobe Marketplace](https://marketplace.magento.com/stripe-stripe-payments.html).\n2.  Delete the file under `~/.composer/auth.json` in case you entered the wrong Adobe Commerce API keys.\n3.  Run the Composer command again. You might have to enter a username and password. Make sure that you enter the Adobe Commerce API keys of the account that you used to place the order. You can [get your authentication keys](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.4/install-gde/prereq/connect-auth.html) from Adobe Commerce.\n\n## Upgrades and caching issues ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nIf you upgrade the module but for some reason don’t see the new changes, you can manually clear the Adobe Commerce cache by deleting a set of directories. The official Adobe Commerce documentation describes which directories to delete for [Adobe Commerce 2.3](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.3/howdoi/php/php_clear-dirs.html) and [Adobe Commerce 2.4](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.4/howdoi/php/php_clear-dirs.html).\n\nAfter you delete these directories, run the following commands:\n\n`php bin/magento setup:upgrade php bin/magento cache:flush`\n\nIf you’re running in production mode, you have to compile and deploy your static assets:\n\n`php bin/magento setup:di:compile php bin/magento setup:static-content:deploy`\n\nIf you’re running Varnish, you must also restart Varnish after deleting the var/cache/\\* files. Some browsers also cache Adobe Commerce requests; if you still have caching issues, try a different browser.\n\n## No payment method at checkout ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nThe payment method may not show at checkout for a few possible reasons:\n\n*   You’re missing the Stripe PHP library or you’re using an old version. You can install this dependency by following step 3 of the [installation instructions](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/adobe-commerce/install)\n*   You have another Stripe module installed that’s using an older version of the Stripe PHP library. Disable or uninstall any other active Stripe module.\n*   You didn’t [configure the Stripe API keys](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/adobe-commerce/configuration#general-settings) properly.\n*   You limited the availability of the payment method to specific countries or currencies.\n\n## Apple Pay or Google Pay not appearing ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nIf you [configured the Payment Request button](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/adobe-commerce/configuration#express-checkout) and it still doesn’t appear, try the following:\n\n*   Make sure that you enabled Apple Pay and Google Pay in your [payment methods settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods).\n*   For Apple Pay, use Safari on an iPhone running iOS 10 and above.\n*   For Google Pay, use Chrome Desktop or Chrome Mobile with a logged in Google account.\n*   Make sure that you have at least one card in your Wallet.\n    *   In iOS, you can add a card by going to **Settings** > **Wallet** > **Apple Pay**.\n    *   In Chrome, you can add a card by going to **Settings** > **Autofill** > **Payment methods** > **Add new credit card**.\n*   Confirm that your [iOS device supports Apple Pay](https://stripe.com/apple-pay).\n*   Confirm that your [Android device supports Google Pay](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-js/elements/payment-request-button).\n*   Confirm that your [domain is registered and verified](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/pmd-registration?dashboard-or-api=dashboard#register-your-domain).\n*   If your website domain starts with `www`, make sure the domain is `www.example.com` and not `example.com`.\n*   You must serve your website over HTTPS using a valid [TLS](https://docs.stripe.com/security/guide#tls \"TLS\") 1.2 certificate—check this from your browser or from [SSL Labs](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/).\n*   Make sure that your HTTPS page doesn’t load any images, CSS, or JavaScript insecurely. You can check this by clicking the padlock on your browser URL bar.\n*   Make sure that you enabled the **Wallet** button in the module’s configuration section.\n*   Make sure that you configured a default fallback country (**Stores** > **Configuration** > **General** > **Country Options** > **Default Country**).\n*   Make sure that you’re not using an older Stripe API key. Apple Pay requires a modern API key, which starts with `pk_live_` or `pk_test_`. You can roll your publishable key in the [Developers section](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys) of the Dashboard.\n*   If you’re using a OneStepCheckout module, you may additionally need to configure the OSC module to refresh the payment form when guest customers submit their billing address. In most cases, this isn’t necessary.\n\nIf Apple Pay appears at checkout, but it doesn’t appear on the product pages, it may be because of additional reasons:\n\n*   You disabled guest checkouts from the Adobe Commerce admin.\n*   Your website is serving your product pages without a valid TLS 1.2 certificate.\n*   You overwrote the **Add to Cart** button template in your theme. Try adding some text to `app/code/StripeIntegration/Payments/view/frontend/templates/express/product_button.phtml`. If your product pages remain unchanged, customize your theme and integrate the two templates together.\n*   JavaScript errors occur when Stripe.js is initializing. Check your browser console for any JavaScript errors related to Stripe.js.\n\n## Pending order stuck ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nWhen creating an order, the initial status is `Pending Payment`, which indicates that the authorization of the payment by the customer’s bank is still pending. For all redirect-based payment methods, when an authorization occurs, Stripe notifies your website using [webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks \"webhook\"). If your orders don’t change from `Pending Payment` to `Processing`, it might indicate that webhooks are missing or incorrect.\n\nGo to your [webhooks settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks) to check if a webhook endpoint with your store URL exists. If not, you can try to manually create it by running the following command from your Magento root directory:\n\n`bin/magento stripe:webhooks:configure`\n\nIf the webhook endpoint already exists, check the **Error Rate** to identify the failing webhooks. You can click on the webhook endpoint to see the error messages. To get assistance on webhook issues that aren’t due to incorrect server configuration, contact [Stripe Support](https://support.stripe.com/) and share details about the errors you encounter.\n\nAfter fixing the webhook issue, you need to resend the `charge.succeeded` events that weren’t delivered correctly to your website. The module provides three commands to resend a single event, a range of events, or events within a date range:\n\n`bin/magento stripe:webhooks:process-event [-f|--force] <event_id> bin/magento stripe:webhooks:process-events-range <from_event_id> <to_event_id> bin/magento stripe:webhooks:process-events-date-range <from_date> [<to_date>]`\n\n#### Note\n\nYou can set a full date and time (`2021-12-21 11:22:33+0200`) or use any English textual datetime description (`last Monday`). This function uses your Magento default timezone unless specified otherwise.\n\nSee [strtotime](https://www.php.net/strtotime) for all the supported date formats.\n\nYou can get a list of all failed `charge.succeeded` events in the [Developers section](https://dashboard.stripe.com/events?type=charge.succeeded&delivery_success=false) of your Stripe Dashboard and decide which ones to resend using one of the commands above.\n\n## Error logging and server-side errors (HTTP 500) ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nAdobe Commerce logs any errors and exceptions it encounters during application runtime in the `var/log` directory. You can find these errors in the following two files:\n\n`var/log/system.log var/log/exception.log`\n\nIf you have SSH access, you can filter the error messages with the following command:\n\n`grep -i Stripe var/log/system.log`\n\nYou can display errors live in the console as they occur (or when you refresh a given page). To monitor errors, run the following command to watch the error log:\n\nIf you don’t have shell access, you can download this file and search for Stripe errors with a text editor.",

    "markdown": "# Enable subscriptions for Adobe Commerce products\n\n## Configure the Stripe Connector for Adobe Commerce to enable subscriptions for any Adobe Commerce product.\n\nYou can turn any [virtual](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-admin/catalog/products/types/product-create-virtual.html?lang=en) or [simple](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-admin/catalog/products/types/product-create-simple.html?lang=en) Adobe Commerce product into a subscription product from its configuration page in your admin panel. When a customer buys a subscription product, the module registers a recurring payment against that order using [Stripe Billing](https://stripe.com/billing). Stripe manages this subscription, attempting payment collection on a recurring basis based on the subscription settings in Adobe Commerce. Stripe can also notify the customer if the payment fails and ask them to update their billing details. You can control this in your [Subscriptions and emails settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/automatic).\n\nOn payment success, your website receives a [webhook](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/adobe-commerce/configuration#webhooks) notification from Stripe. The module automatically creates a new order in your Adobe Commerce admin panel for each renewal. These recurring orders don’t include the initial subscription fees, and the module recalculates the shipping and tax amounts for each individual recurring subscription product.\n\n## How to enable and configure subscriptions![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYou can enable [subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/creating \"subscriptions\") for any Adobe Commerce product from the product configuration page. When creating or editing a product, scroll down until you see the **Stripe Subscriptions** section:\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/configure-subscriptions.b12826232ddbe6ab5ac8e6419f8252ee.png)\n\nConfiguration options for subscriptions\n\nHere, you have the following options:\n\n*   **Subscription Enabled:** Turn this on to convert this product into a subscription and automatically create a subscription plan when customers check out with this product. You don’t need to create a subscription plan in your Stripe account. A subscription plan is automatically created for this product when your customers check out.\n*   **Frequency:** Select **Days**, **Weeks**, **Months**, or **Years**. The customer sees whatever you select here for the frequency. If you prefer to display **30 Days** instead of **1 Month**, set this to **Days** instead. If you select **Days**, the subscription cycle in your Stripe account reflects this.\n*   **Repeat Every:** Set the length of the billing cycle based on the specified frequency. For example, a value of 30 here with frequency of **Days** bills every 30 days.\n*   **Trial Days:** Enter the number of days before the first charge for the subscription (that is, the number of free days).\n*   **Initial Fee:** Enter an amount to charge in addition to the subscription price.\n*   **Start on specific date:** Enable to expose custom start date specification options. When customers purchase the subscription, it begins on the specified date instead of starting immediately.\n*   **Pick start date:** Specify the start date for the subscription. The format is a specific date, but the start date forwards to the next applicable billing cycle after the start date has passed. For example, if the start date is `01/01/2024`, a monthly subscription always starts on the 1st of the month, while a 6-month subscription always starts on either January 1st or July 1st.\n*   **First payment:** Specify how to collect the first payment when you enable a start date:\n    *   Collect it on the specified start date.\n    *   Collect the first payment when the order is placed, and all subsequent payments on the specified start date. This option is useful for physical product subscriptions that ship the first product immediately when ordered, with subsequent shipments conforming to the start date of the billing cycle.\n*   **Prorate first payment:** Setting an immediate first payment exposes this field. Enable this setting to account for the number of days from the date of the order placement to the subscription start date so the first payment reflects the shortened cycle before the full subscription begins.\n*   **Customers can change subscription:** Enable to allow customers to edit their subscription from the customer account section. They can change the quantity, customizable options, configurable options or bundle options of each order item. These are additional edit options to the shipping address, shipping method or payment method, which customers can always change at any time.\n*   **Prorate upgrades:** Enable to apply a fee to account for any price difference when a customer upgrades their subscription between billing cycles. Disable to defer the new subscription price until the next billing cycle.\n*   **Prorate downgrades:** Enable to credit the customer’s account balance when they downgrade their subscription mid-cycle and apply the credit to future subscription payments. Disable to apply the lower price to the next billing cycle.\n\n## Configurable subscriptions![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYou can use Magento [configurable products](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-admin/catalog/products/types/product-create-configurable.html?lang=en) to offer multiple options to your customers for a single product. Customers can choose their preferred option using either a drop-down, a visual swatch, or a text swatch. Each option can be a simple or virtual product and that product can itself be a subscription.\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/subscription-configurable.bc087bed26a306087b175e3681d2d1f0.png)\n\nConfigurable subscription\n\n1.  Go to **Stores** > **Attributes** > **Product**.\n    \n2.  Create an [attribute](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-admin/catalog/products/types/product-create-configurable.html?lang=en#step-1%3A-choose-the-attributes) and choose your preferred input type and labels.\n    \n3.  Make sure to set the attribute to be on the **Global** scope.\n    \n4.  Go to **Stores** > **Attributes** > **Attribute Set** and add the attribute to an attribute set.\n    \n5.  Add the attribute set to your single products.\n    \n6.  You can now create a configurable product using the single products updated above.\n    \n\n## Bundled subscriptions![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nAdobe Commerce allows you to [bundle products](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-admin/catalog/products/types/product-create-bundle.html?lang=en) when you want to sell multiple products together. This prevents customers from removing an individual product from the cart before checkout.\n\nWhen a bundle product includes at least one subscription, Stripe treats the price of the entire bundle as the subscription price. For recurring payments, Stripe collects both the amount of the entire bundle item and the individual subscription item of the bundle.\n\nAfter payment collection, Adobe Commerce automatically creates a recurring order that includes the entire bundle item (the subscription items and regular items from the original order). Inventory is then processed for the subscription and the other products in the bundle. This contrasts with carts that include subscriptions and regular products separately. In that case, recurring orders only include the subscription product.\n\nIf you want to combine a subscription product with a regular product and only bill the subscription product in the next cycle, you can use [grouped products](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-admin/catalog/products/types/product-create-grouped.html?lang=en). Alternatively, you can configure an initial fee for the subscription when there’s no inventory to process.\n\n## Switch subscription plans![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nCustomers can change the following from their account:\n\n*   Configurable, bundled, simple, and virtual subscriptions\n*   Customizable or configurable options\n*   Quantities\n*   Bundle options\n*   Shipping address or method\n*   Payment method\n\nCustomers can also switch between two or more plans as long as they belong to the same [configurable product](#configurable-subscriptions).\n\n1.  The customer logs into their account and goes to **My subscriptions**.\n    \n2.  They select the subscription they want to change and click **Change subscription**.\n    \n3.  The customer is redirected to the subscription product page, where they can change their plan, quantities, or other product options.\n    \n4.  When they click **Update cart**, they’re automatically redirected to the checkout page, where they can review the old and new subscription prices.\n    \n5.  The customer clicks **Update subscription**, which immediately updates the subscription price or plan. The customer is then redirected to **My subscriptions** in their account.\n    \n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/subscription-customer-update.3aac87ba9a5df4ecdad3277ccede9988.png)\n\nConfigurable subscription\n\nYou can enable or disable subscription changes for each subscription product separately or you can use the global setting under **Stores** > **Configuration** > **Sales** > **Payment Methods** > **Stripe** > **Subscriptions**.\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/subscription-enable-update-stripe-billing.b63b6a19302660c1daeaac8367977287.png)\n\nConfigurable subscription\n\n## Prorations for virtual subscriptions![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe module supports [prorations](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/prorations) for virtual subscriptions. You can enable prorations for upgrades or downgrades separately.\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/subscription-proration.5a1c316d68a7e111e2bd938e96b1daae.png)\n\nConfigurable subscription\n\nThe module compares what both the current and new plan cost for a 30-day period to determine whether or not it’s an upgrade or downgrade. If the cost of the new plan is lower, we consider it a downgrade. If the price remains the same or if it’s higher, we consider it an upgrade.\n\n*   For downgrades, we create a refund that we record as a credit memo on the original order.\n*   For upgrades that require an extra payment, we immediately create a new order with the prorated amount for the remainder of the billing period.\n*   For upgrades with the same cost, there’s no payment or refund and we add a comment to the original order to indicate that the customer changed their subscription.\n\nIn all three cases, the module creates the renewal order with the new plan at the next billing cycle.\n\n## Changing customer subscriptions in bulk from the command line ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nYou can increase or reduce the subscription price for a specific product, or change the shipping cost, product name, or tax rates of an order. To do so, you must migrate existing subscriptions from an old plan to a new one using a CLI command within the Stripe module.\n\n`php bin/magento stripe:subscriptions:migrate-subscription-price <original_product_id> <new_product_id> [<starting_order_id> [<ending_order_id>]]`\n\nThis creates a new order for `new_product_id` as if the customer placed the order during checkout. The billing and shipping details are the same as the initial order, and it uses the same payment method for the subscription.\n\nThe module recalculates the order totals based on the new tax rules, shipping method, price changes, and so on. If the original order had any discounts, they also apply to the new order. The total doesn’t include any of the initial fees.\n\nSuccessfully placing the order cancels the original order, including the `original_product_id`. The module adds a comment to the original order mentioning the migration to a new order, and the cancellation of the associated subscription in Stripe. The customer also receives a new order email that tells them their subscription billing details have changed. They can review the new totals in the same email.\n\nIf the module can’t place the order for any reason, the built-in rollback system cancels the new order creation and leaves the original order intact.\n\nYou can use the `original_product_id` as the `new_product_id`, which means that the module only recalculates the order totals. It’s possible to migrate from simple subscription products (physical products with a single [SKU](https://docs.stripe.com/api/skus \"SKU\")) to virtual subscription products, but not the other way around. This limitation is because physical products require a shipping address but virtual products don’t.\n\nThe order ID parameters are optional. If they’re not specified, the script processes all orders in your website from all store views and all Stripe modes. If you have multiple Stripe accounts configured, the script migrates subscriptions from all Stripe accounts.\n\n## Migrate Stripe Subscriptions from another platform to Adobe Commerce![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nTo migrate subscriptions from another platform, you need to perform the following tasks:\n\n1.  Create a mapping between your Adobe Commerce customer IDs and the Stripe customer IDs in the “stripe\\_customers” database table of Adobe Commerce. You can do this with the following SQL statement in your database:\n    \n    `INSERT INTO stripe_customers(customer_id, stripe_id, customer_email) VALUES ('2', 'cus_xxxxxxxxxx', 'janedoe@example.com');`\n    \n2.  Create and configure all subscription products for old orders from the **Subscriptions by Stripe** tab under each product’s configuration page:\n    \n    ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/subscription-fields.bd3c35b64f2140b5a1e81a1ea87fffcd.png)\n    \n    Subscription configuration form\n    \n3.  Migrate the orders from your old platform to Adobe Commerce. If you plan on creating them manually from the Adobe Commerce admin area, you can use the **Check / Money Order** payment method so it doesn’t collect a live payment. After you finish the order migration, you can replace this payment method with Stripe using the following SQL command:\n    \n    `UPDATE sales_order_payment SET method='stripe_payments' WHERE method='checkmo';`\n    \n4.  After creating the orders and products successfully in Adobe Commerce, update the existing Subscriptions in your Stripe account to set the following metadata:\n    \n    ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/subscription-metadata.9626076f0ef6b57017a28ca259569d0e.png)\n    \n    Subscription metadata list\n    \n    #### Note\n    \n5.  Test the creation of recurring orders based on subscription renewals:\n    \n\n*   Check that you have at least one configured [webhook](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks \"webhook\") in your Stripe Dashboard under **Developers** > **Webhooks**.\n*   From your **Stripe Events** section, locate an event that you want to test. The event type must be `invoice.payment_succeeded` and the Invoice must belong to a Subscription.\n*   From your Magento root directory, trigger the event with the following command: `bin/magento stripe:webhooks:process-event <event_id>`.\n*   Make sure there were no errors in the console and that the module created a recurring subscription order in Adobe Commerce.",

    "markdown": "# Build a custom storefront | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Learn how to build a custom storefront that supports Stripe payment features.\n\nAdobe Commerce can operate as a headless commerce platform that’s decoupled from its storefront. You can use the REST API or GraphQL API to build custom storefronts, such as progressive web apps (PWA), mobile apps, or frontends based on React, Vue, or other frameworks.\n\nThe Stripe module extends the REST API and GraphQL API by:\n\n*   Setting payment method tokens during order placement\n*   Performing 3D Secure customer authentication\n*   Managing customers’ saved payment methods\n\nThe Stripe module uses the REST API on the checkout page. You can find examples of how to use the API in the Stripe module directory under the `examples/` subdirectory. This guide uses the GraphQL API to build a custom storefront.\n\n[](#retrieve-initialization-parameters)\n\nTo initialize Stripe.js and the payment form on the front end, you need the Stripe [publishable API key](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#obtain-api-keys) that you configured in the admin area. You can retrieve the key and other initialization parameters using the following GraphQL mutation:\n\n`query { getStripeConfiguration { \tapiKey \t\tlocale \t\tappInfo \t\toptions { \t\t\tbetas \t\t\tapiVersion \t\t} \telementsOptions \t} }`\n\n[](#tokenize-payment-method)\n\nYou can use the [PaymentElement](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-element) to collect a payment method from the customer during checkout. After the customer provides their payment method details and clicks **Place Order**, you can tokenize the payment method and use it to place the order. Calling `createPaymentMethod` [generates a payment method token](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/finalize-payments-on-the-server-legacy?type=payment#create-pm) from the details provided in the `PaymentElement`.\n\n`var stripe = Stripe(API_PUBLISHABLE_KEY);  var options = {   mode: 'payment',   amount: 1099,   currency: 'eur' };  var elements = stripe.elements(options); var paymentElement = elements.create('payment'); paymentElement.mount('#payment-element');  var placeOrder = function() {     elements.submit().then(function()     {         stripe.createPaymentMethod({             elements: elements,             params: {                 billing_details: {                     name: 'Jenny Rosen'                 }             }         }).then(function(result)         {             if (result && result.paymentMethod)             {                 // Success             }         });     }); }`\n\n[](#pass-tokenized-payment-method)\n\nAfter you obtain a payment method token, you must call `setPaymentMethodOnCart` to [set the payment method](https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/webapi/graphql/tutorials/checkout/set-payment-method/#set-payment-method-on-cart) on the order.\n\n`mutation {   setPaymentMethodOnCart(input: {       cart_id: \"CART_ID\"       payment_method: {         code: \"stripe_payments\"         stripe_payments: {           payment_method: \"PAYMENT_METHOD_ID\"           save_payment_method: true         }       }   }) {     cart {       selected_payment_method {         code       }     }   } }`\n\nUse the following parameters for `setPaymentMethodOnCart`:\n\n| Parameter | Type | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `payment_method` | String | Use this parameter to pass the tokenized payment method ID. You can also pass saved payment method tokens when a customer chooses a saved payment method during checkout. |\n| `save_payment_method` | Boolean | Specify whether or not to save the payment method. |\n| `cvc_token` | String | If CVC is enabled for saved cards, use this parameter to pass the CVC token and perform verification. |\n\n[](#place-order)\n\nAfter you set the payment method token, you can use the Adobe Commerce `placeOrder` mutation to place an order:\n\n`mutation {   placeOrder(input: {cart_id: \"CART_ID\"}) {     order {       order_number       client_secret     }   } }`\n\nThe example above requests a `client_secret`, which isn’t a default `placeOrder` mutation parameter. The Stripe module adds this parameter for you to use after the order is placed to finalize details specific to the selected payment method. You can finalize payment with the `stripe.handleNextAction(client_secret)` method. Options include performing an inline 3D Secure authentication for cards, displaying a printable voucher for certain payment methods, or redirecting the customer externally for authentication.\n\n[](#order-placement-flow)\n\nPayment methods of type `card` or `link` that require 3D Secure (3DS) customer authentication go through the following process:\n\n1.  The order is placed in `Pending Payment` status.\n2.  The client secret is passed to the front end to perform the authentication.\n3.  After successful authentication, payment is collected client-side, and the customer is redirected to the order success page.\n4.  A `charge.succeeded` webhook event arrives at your website on the server side.\n5.  The module handles the event and changes the order status from `Payment Pending` to `processing`.\n\nThat procedure is the default for GraphQL, but not for the REST API. With the REST API, if customer authentication is required, the order placement fails with an `Authentication Required: client_secret` error. You must authenticate the payment using the `client_secret`, and the order placement must be attempted again following successful authentication. This approach’s advantage is that inventory isn’t held until the payment is successful. To employ this procedure with GraphQL, edit the module’s `etc/config.xml` file by adding `card` and `link` under the `<graphql_api>` node:\n\n`<manual_authentication>      <rest_api>card,link</rest_api>      <graphql_api>card,link</graphql_api> </manual_authentication>`\n\n[](#retrieve-payment-methods)\n\nYou can use `listStripePaymentMethods` to retrieve a list of saved payment methods for a customer in an active checkout session.\n\n`mutation {   listStripePaymentMethods {     id     created     type     fingerprint     label     icon     cvc     brand     exp_month     exp_year   } }`\n\n[](#save-payment-method)\n\nYou can use `addStripePaymentMethod` to save payment methods to a customer’s account. The `payment_method` parameter is the tokenized payment method ID. The tokenization process is similar to the tokenization process during the checkout flow.\n\n`mutation {   addStripePaymentMethod(     input: {       payment_method: \"PAYMENT_METHOD_ID\"     }   ) {     id     created     type     fingerprint     label     icon     cvc     brand     exp_month     exp_year   } }`\n\n[](#delete-payment-method)\n\nYou can use `deleteStripePaymentMethod` to allow customers to delete saved payment methods from their account.\n\nFor most use cases, we recommend passing a payment method fingerprint, which deletes all payment methods that match the fingerprint. The `listStripePaymentMethods` mutation automatically removes duplicates before returning recently added payment methods that match a specific fingerprint. But if you only delete a payment method by ID, the results of `listStripePaymentMethods` might include an older saved payment method with the same fingerprint.\n\n`mutation {   deleteStripePaymentMethod(     input: {       payment_method: \"paste a payment method ID here\"       fingerprint: null     }   ) }`",

The orders must be accepted or refused within 7 days, the validity period of an authorization.\n\nBecause the payment confirmation is immediate for bank redirects, wallets and buy now, pay later, we recommend setting up your orders to be accepted automatically and using refunds when sellers can’t fulfill their order.\n\n### Pay on delivery![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nFor cards, you can authorize only during checkout if you have business rules in place to capture the payment within 7 days. Otherwise, [save the card](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/save-and-reuse) at checkout and authorize later.\n\nFor bank debits, you can save the bank account at checkout and initiate the payment after the seller accepts their order.\n\n### Pay on due date![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYou can use Stripe Billing to [send an invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/dashboard) to your customers who can then pay using our [hosted invoice page](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/hosted-invoice-page).\n\n## Payment validation![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nTo handle the payment validation of your Mirakl orders, you can rely on the built-in job or call the [PA01](https://help.mirakl.net/help/api-doc/operator/mmp.html#PA01) API yourself if you have specific needs such as offering coupons.\n\nTo enable the built-in job, you have to first map the Mirakl order with the successful Charge by updating the metadata:\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/charges/ch_1Hmloy2eZvKYlo2C2Tx3W00V \\   -u` \n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`: \\   -d \"metadata[mirakl_commercial_order_id]\"=123`\n\nThe workflow starts when a seller accepts their logistic order.\n\n1.  The [payment validation job](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/mirakl/reference#payment-validation) fetches newly accepted Mirakl orders.\n2.  The connector validates the payment in Mirakl.\n3.  For cards, the payment is captured when all the logistic orders are accepted or refused.\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/payment-validation.b4e38338cc8ca2b4b9a6b54381e11fb8.svg)\n\n## Payment split![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe workflow starts when the payment is validated on Mirakl and captured on Stripe.\n\n1.  The [payment split job](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/mirakl/reference#payment-split) fetches newly validated Mirakl orders.\n2.  The connector transfers the order amount to the seller after deducting your commission.\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/payment-split.854d23364864078f73b0f85509048073.svg)\n\n## Payment refund![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe workflow starts when you request a refund on a Mirakl order.\n\n1.  The [payment refund job](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/mirakl/reference#payment-refund) fetches newly refunded Mirakl orders.\n2.  The connector creates a refund on Stripe, validates the refund on Mirakl, and then reverses the transfer used to split the payment.\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/payment-refund.542699f87703a1899287530589e40614.svg)",

If you invite the seller via email, the workflow starts when they submit the initial Mirakl form.\n\n1.  The [onboarding job](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/mirakl/reference#onboarding) fetches newly created Mirakl shops.\n2.  The connector adds an onboarding link to each shop.\n3.  The seller finds the link in their Mirakl back office under **My Account**.\n4.  They complete their KYC/KYB on Stripe.\n5.  The seller is redirected to the `REDIRECT_ONBOARDING` URL.\n\nStripe then performs verification, asking for more information when needed. To handle this, see the [communication](#communication) guidelines.\n\n### Initiate the onboarding outside of Mirakl![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYou can build your own onboarding flow and then use the following API request to map the Stripe account with the Mirakl shop:\n\n`curl \\ \t-X POST \"https://connector-url/api/mappings\" \\ \t-H \"accept: application/json\" \\ \t-H \"X-AUTH-TOKEN:` \n\n`$OPERATOR_PASSWORD`\n\n`\" \\ \t-H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ \t-d \"{ \\\"miraklShopId\\\": 123, \\\"stripeUserId\\\": \\\"acct_1032D82eZvKYlo2C\\\"}\"`\n\n## Seller account update![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe workflow starts with the seller intending to update their information on Stripe.\n\n1.  The seller finds the link in their Mirakl back office under **My Account**.\n2.  They update their information on Stripe.\n3.  The shop custom field is updated with a fresh login link to their [Express dashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/express-dashboard).\n4.  The KYC status is updated on Mirakl.\n\nThe last two steps are also performed when accounts are updated by the connector during the [account initiation workflow](#account-initiation-workflow) or when accounts are updated by Stripe, for example, a new document needs to be provided. You can receive a notification when that happens, see the [Account updated](https://docs.stripe.com/connectors/mirakl/reference#account-updated) notification.\n\nStripe then performs verification, asking for more information when needed. To handle this, see the [communication](#communication) guidelines.\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/seller-account-update.952e89cdf275dc5c34146b87cd06b603.svg)\n\n## Communication![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYou can customize the visual appearance of the Stripe form with your brand’s name, color, and icon in your [Connect settings page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/applications/settings).\n\nBe sure to tell your sellers about the link available in their Mirakl account settings and the need to complete the onboarding on Stripe to receive their payouts. For example, you could customize some of the email templates sent to your sellers by Mirakl under **Settings** > **Notifications**.\n\nIf we require more information from your sellers, we’ll email them directly for Express accounts. You must inform the sellers yourself if you decided to use Custom accounts.\n\n#### Note\n\nIn test mode, no emails are sent.",

Choose your default [product tax code](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-codes), which allows Stripe to calculate the tax rate for categories of products.\n3.  Click **Save changes**.\n\nOn the **Tax** tab, you can decide if the prices you set for your products are inclusive or exclusive of tax.\n\n[](#tax-registrations)\n\nTax isn’t applied [until you add registrations](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/zero-tax#situations-where-stripe-calculates-zero-tax) for jurisdictions where you need to collect tax. Our [monitoring tool](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/monitoring) can help you understand where you might be registered or need to register.\n\nIf you’re already registered in certain jurisdictions and want to start collecting tax immediately, you can add those registrations to your configuration. You can only add tax registrations for [supported countries and registration types](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/supported-countries#supported-countries). Some jurisdictions might require additional information.\n\n### Add tax registration![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nOn the **Stripe Tax** tab, under **Tax registrations**, click **Add new**. Choose the jurisdiction from the dropdown, then click **Save changes**.\n\n### Delete tax registration![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nTo delete a registration, hover over the registration, then click **End immediately**. To delete multiple registrations, select them from the list, then click **End immediately** from the **Bulk actions** dropdown.\n\n[](#collect-taxes)\n\nTo start collecting taxes:\n\n*   On the **WooCommerce** > **General** tab, select **Enable tax rates and calculations**, then click **Save changes**. This setting enables rate configuration and tax calculation during the checkout process.\n    \n*   On the **WooCommerce** > **Stripe Tax** tab, select **Enable Stripe Tax**, then click **Save changes**. This setting enables automatic tax calculation and collection on all transactions.\n    \n\n[](#tax-reports)\n\nAfter you start collecting taxes, the Stripe Tax connector sends the transactions to Stripe Tax. You can then access tax reports and exports in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/registrations).\n\nLearn more about the types of [tax reports](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/reports) available in Stripe Tax.",

    "markdown": "# Install Stripe Connector for Salesforce B2C Commerce Shopfront Reference Architecture\n\n## Learn about the Stripe Connector for Salesforce Commerce Cloud Shopfront architecture.\n\n### Stripe Payment Element![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nStripe [Payment Element](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-element) modifies the default Commerce Cloud credit card collection and processing by using Stripe.js, a JavaScript library, to securely tokenize credit card data. Payments are then processed using the tokenized data, instead of raw credit card information.\n\nDuring checkout, the cartridge creates a PaymentIntent for any new cards or alternate payment methods that a customer enters. This tokenized data generates a Stripe Charge at the point of purchase.\n\n### Stripe.js sources![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nWhen customers enter credit card or other payment information on the storefront, Stripe.js tokenizes it in interactions between Stripe and the client (browser). Unmasked credit card data is therefore never sent to the Commerce Cloud servers.\n\n### Stripe PaymentIntent![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe [PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents) workflow guides you through the process of collecting a payment from your customer. A PaymentIntent transitions through [multiple statuses](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/paymentintents/lifecycle) throughout its lifetime as it interfaces with Stripe.js to perform authentication flows and creates, at most, one successful charge.\n\nThe system creates a Stripe Charge (authorize or capture, based on Business Manager configuration) from a successfully created and submitted Basket. All Stripe Charges are created against a Stripe payment source.\n\n### AVS auto-fail transactions![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nSite administrators can select a variety of AVS statuses to auto fail an order for. If the Stripe charge returns any of the selected statuses for either `address_line1_check` or `address_zip_check`, the order is auto-failed and the Stripe charge reversed. You can also manage these settings on the Stripe Dashboard. Supported payment methods:\n\n*   Cards (Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Discover, Diners Club, JCB, Alipay).\n*   The Payment Request button element gives you a single integration for Apple Pay, Google Pay, and the browser standard Payment Request API.\n\n## Limitations and constraints![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nStripe offers a number of standard services that aren’t supported by the cartridge. These include support for subscriptions, plans, and coupons. There aren’t any known locale specific restrictions in the cartridge.\n\nThe included RELAY OCAPI configurations are included as examples only. A RELAY implementation requires additional configuration and testing along with the Stripe team. For any locale specific restrictions, see the [Stripe.js documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/js).\n\n## Compatibility![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nAvailable since Commerce Cloud Platform Release 16.8, SFRA version 4.4.\n\nThe cartridge is available for installation on storefronts that support both controller and SFRA SiteGenesis implementations.\n\n## Privacy![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nCommerce Cloud doesn’t store any unmasked credit card data. The cartridge tokenizes all payment data within direct client-to-Stripe communications and obscures any sensitive credit card data before it arrives on the Commerce Cloud servers. Similarly, all credit card data that Commerce Cloud retrieves from the Stripe servers is either masked, tokenized, or both.",

Additionally, controller and SFRA support is broken out into two separate cartridges, thereby facilitating the installation and use of one or the other models.\n\nImport all three cartridges into UX studio and associate them with a Server Connection.\n\n### Site cartridge assignment![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n1.  Navigate to **Administration > Sites > Manage Sites**.\n2.  Click the site name for the storefront site you want to add Stripe functionality to.\n3.  Select the **Settings** tab.\n4.  For Storefront Reference Architecture (SFRA), add `app_stripe_sfra:int_stripe_sfra:int_stripe_core` to the cartridge path.\n\nRepeat these steps for each storefront site where you want to implement Stripe.\n\n### Business Manager cartridge assignment![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n1.  Navigate to **Administration > Sites > Manage Sites**.\n2.  Click the **Business Manager Site** and then the **Manage the Business Manager site** link.\n3.  Add `int_stripe_core` to the cartridge path.\n\n### Metadata import![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n1.  Navigate to the metadata folder of the project and open the `stripe_site_template` folder.\n2.  Open the `sites` folder and edit the `siteIDHere` folder to the site ID of the site you want.\n3.  Add a folder for each site you want Stripe on.\n4.  Navigate to **Administration > Site Development > Site Import & Export**.\n5.  Compress the `stripe_site_template` folder into a zip file and import it.\n\n### Build Stripe styling![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nIf necessary, update the path to your base SFRA installation in `package.json` from the same root folder.\n\nNormally, there’s a top-level project folder in which the repositories of the SFRA base cartridge and all required plugins, libraries, and any other LINK cartridges are cloned. If you cloned the Stripe cartridge into that folder as well, you don’t need to update the `paths.base` property. If you haven’t cloned the cartridge into that folder, update the `paths.base` property in `package.json` with the relative path to the local directory containing the Storefront Reference Architecture repository. The following is the default `paths.base` value:\n\n`\"paths\": {   \"base\": \"../storefront-reference-architecture/cartridges/app_storefront_base/\" }`\n\nAfter you’re certain `package.json` has the correct path to SFRA cartridges, run the `npm run compile:scss` command from the root folder of the Stripe repository.\n\n### Add new payment processors![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThere are two payment processors used in the Stripe cartridge. `STRIPE_CREDIT` handles credit card payments while `STRIPE_APM` handles local payment methods such as bank transfers and giropay.\n\n#### Credit payment processor![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n1.  Navigate to **Merchant Tools > Ordering > Payment Processors** and click **New**.\n2.  In the new window, set the ID to `STRIPE_CREDIT` and click **Apply**.\n\n#### APM payment processor![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n1.  Navigate to **Merchant Tools > Ordering > Payment Processors** and click **New**.\n2.  In the new window, set the ID attribute to value `STRIPE_APM` and click **Apply**.\n\n### Update payment methods![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nNavigate to **Merchant Tools > Ordering > Payment Methods**, click the **CREDIT\\_CARD** payment method, and select the **STRIPE\\_CREDIT** payment processor in the dropdown under the **CREDIT\\_CARD** details section.\n\nFor dynamic payment methods or the Payment Request Button, enable **STRIPE\\_APM\\_METHODS** to include payment methods supported by Stripe. See the [payment methods guide](https://stripe.com/payments/payment-methods-guide) for more details.\n\nTo utilize the Stripe Payment Request Button, enable the **STRIPE\\_PAYMENT\\_REQUEST\\_BTN** payment method. Refer to [payment request button](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-js/elements/payment-request-button) for more details.\n\n## Install the Stripe Salesforce Commerce app![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nUse Stripe Apps to bolster security and simplify the use of distinct restricted keys for each integration with your Stripe account. The process of installing the Stripe App and acquiring the newly generated secret and publishable [keys](https://docs.stripe.com/keys) is essential for your integration with the Salesforce Commerce connector. This approach eliminates the need to manually create your own restricted key or use a secret key. To integrate the Salesforce Commerce app and reinforce your account’s security infrastructure:\n\n1.  Navigate to the [Stripe App Marketplace](https://marketplace.stripe.com/), then click [Install the Salesforce Commerce app](https://marketplace.stripe.com/apps/install/link/com.stripe.SalesforceCommerce).\n2.  Select the Stripe account where you want to install the app.\n3.  Review and approve the app permissions, install the app in test mode or live mode, then click **Install**.\n4.  After you install the app, store the keys in a safe place where you won’t lose them. To help yourself remember where you stored it, you can [leave a note on the key in the Dashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#reveal-an-api-secret-key-live-mode).\n5.  Use the newly generated publishable key and secret key to finish the Connector configuration.\n6.  To manage the app or generate new security keys after installation, navigate to the application settings page in [test mode](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/settings/apps/com.stripe.SalesforceCommerce) or [live mode](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/apps/com.stripe.SalesforceCommerce).\n\n## Configuration![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nUpdate **Merchant Tools > Site Preferences > Custom Site Preferences > Stripe Configurations** with site-specific values.\n\n*   Populate Stripe secret API key with the values from the Stripe Salesforce Commerce app.\n    \n*   Populate publishable API key with the values from the Stripe Salesforce Commerce app.\n    \n*   **Is this SFRA installation:** Set to `yes` if the current site is using SFRA.\n    \n*   **Capture Funds on Stripe Charge:** The default value is `true` (Yes). Set to `false` (No) to authorize Stripe charges instead.\n    \n*   **Stripe card element CSS style:** Set the CSS styling that the card element button inherits to fit within the overall storefront styles (for example, `{\"base\": {\"fontFamily\": \"Arial, sans-serif\",\"fontSize\": \"14px\",\"color\": \"#C1C7CD\"},\"invalid\": {\"color\": \"red\" } }`).\n    \n*   **Stripe API URL:** `https://js.stripe.com/v3/`\n    \n*   **Stripe Payment Request Button Style:** For the payment request button, select the limited CSS styling for the button. Refer to [styling the element](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-js/elements/payment-request-button#styling-the-element) for more details.\n    \n*   **Apple Pay Verification String:** Enter the Apple verification string provided from the Stripe Dashboard. This is a one-time enablement. The Stripe console proxies the Apple Pay for a web verification string upon setup. Configure this in the sandbox if using the Payment Request Button as a form of payment on the storefront.\n    \n*   **Country Code (Stripe Payment Request Button):** This is the default country code (for example, US) for the Payment Request Button. You might need to customize on a multi-country single site in order to dynamically pass the country code rather than the site preference. Refer to [creating a payment request instance](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-js/elements/payment-request-button) for more details.\n    \n*   **Stripe webhook signing secret:** Enter the [webhook](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks \"webhook\") signing secret provided by the Stripe Dashboard. Stripe signs webhook events and passes a validation to SFCC. SFCC validates the contents of the message using this secret.\n    \n*   **Stripe Allowed Webhook Statuses:** Configure the [allowed statuses](#stripe-dashboard-set-up) for webhooks to respond to.\n    \n    ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/configuration-webhook-statuses.01dca58aedb406537570122a457afa09.png)\n    \n*   **Allowed apm methods:**\n    \n    *   Enumeration of allowed payment methods from the Stripe API: `{ \"default\": [ \"p24\", \"eps\", \"sepa_debit\", \"ideal\", \"sofort\", \"bitcoin\", \"alipay\", \"bancontact\", \"giropay\" ], \"en_UK\": [ \"p24\", \"eps\" ], \"de_AT\": [ \"sofort\", \"ideal\" ] }`. Update this field per site locale to indicate which alternate payment methods are enabled for each locale. Refer to [sources](https://docs.stripe.com/sources) for more details.\n*   **Stripe Enabled:** Enables or disables the cartridge.\n    \n\n## Set up webhook endpoint and Apple Pay domain ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nSet up a new endpoint in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/webhooks) with the Stripe-WebHook controller URL and subscribe to these events:\n\n*   `review.opened`\n*   `review.closed`\n*   `charge.succeeded`\n*   `source.canceled`\n*   `source.failed`\n*   `source.chargeable`\n*   `payment_intent.succeeded`\n*   `payment_intent.payment_failed`\n\nCopy the signing secret to the **Stripe Webhook Signing Secret** preference. Make sure that this value is set to your Stripe account’s country code.\n\nFor Apple Pay:\n\n1.  Update `RedirectURL.js`:\n\n`server.extend(page);  server.replace('Start', function (req, res, next) {   const URLRedirectMgr = require('dw/web/URLRedirectMgr');    // Intercept the incoming path request   if (URLRedirectMgr.getRedirectOrigin() === '/.well-known/apple-developer-merchantid-domain-association') {     res.render('stripe/util/apple');     return next();   }    const redirect = URLRedirectMgr.redirect;   const location = redirect ? redirect.location : null;   const redirectStatus = redirect ? redirect.getStatus() : null;    if (!location) {     res.setStatusCode(404);     res.render('error/notFound');   } else {     if (redirectStatus) {       res.setRedirectStatus(redirectStatus);     }     res.redirect(location);   }    return next(); });`\n\n1.  Set up an alias to one of the sites on the sandbox temporarily so that the domain can be verified in the Stripe Dashboard. The alias needs to be something like this:\n\n`{   \"__version\": \"1\",     \"settings\": {       \"http-host\": \"your.sandbox.domain.demandware.net\",       \"https-host\": \"your.sandbox.domain.demandware.net\",       \"default\": \"true\",       \"site-path\": \"/\",   },   \"your.sandbox.domain.demandware.net\": [     {       \"locale\": \"en_GB\",       \"if-site-path\": \"/\",     }   ] }`\n\nThe locale value needs to be a locale that isn’t disabled.\n\n1.  On the [Payment method domains page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_method_domains), click **Add a new domain**.\n2.  Enter your domain name.\n3.  Click **Save and continue**.\n4.  Download the [domain association file](https://stripe.com/files/apple-pay/apple-developer-merchantid-domain-association).\n5.  Host the file at `/.well-known/apple-developer-merchantid-domain-association`. For example, if you register `https://example.com`, make that file available at `https://example.com/.well-known/apple-developer-merchantid-domain-association`.\n6.  Click **Verify**.\n\n## Update storefront code![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe base LINK cartridge code contains support for all credit cards supported by Stripe. The list of allowed cards on the storefront is still limited by the Credit/Debit Cards list in Business Manager (Merchant Tools > Ordering > Payment Methods > Credit/Debit Cards).\n\nMake the following updates to the Storefront Code. Examples provided are based on SFRA version 4.4. The following sections detail the customizations made to SFRA code.\n\nThere are many controller endpoints that are appends instead of replaces. Those aren’t covered as they should work without doing anything.\n\nController updates are only required for replaced endpoints, as you might have already replaced that endpoint in your integration. Use the changes made to the base cartridge and add them to your already replaced controller. If you haven’t extended/replaced these endpoints, you don’t need to do anything.\n\n### Controller: CheckoutServices.js ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nPath: `app_stripe_sfra/cartridge/controllers/CheckoutServices.js`\n\nRemove the payment instrument validation in the `SubmitPayment` endpoint:\n\n`if (!paymentMethodID && currentBasket.totalGrossPrice.value > 0) {   const noPaymentMethod = {};    noPaymentMethod[billingData.paymentMethod.htmlName] = Resource.msg(     'error.no.selected.payment.method',     'payment',     null   );    delete billingData.paymentInformation;   res.json({     form: billingForm,     fieldErrors: [noPaymentMethod],     serverErrors: [],     error: true   });   return; }  // Validate payment instrument const creditCardPaymentMethod = PaymentMgr.getPaymentMethod(PaymentInstrument.METHOD_CREDIT_CARD); const paymentCard = PaymentMgr.getPaymentCard(billingData.paymentInformation.cardType.value);  const applicablePaymentCards = creditCardPaymentMethod.getApplicablePaymentCards(   req.currentCustomer.raw,   req.geolocation.countryCode,   null );  if (!applicablePaymentCards.contains(paymentCard)) {   // Invalid payment instrument   const invalidPaymentMethod = Resource.msg('error.payment.not.valid', 'checkout', null);   delete billingData.paymentInformation;   res.json({     form: billingForm,     fieldErrors: [],     serverErrors: [invalidPaymentMethod],     error: true   });   return; }`\n\nUpdate the order creation code:\n\n`// Re-calculate the payments const calculatedPaymentTransactionTotal = COHelpers.calculatePaymentTransaction(currentBasket); if (calculatedPaymentTransactionTotal.error) {   res.json({       error: true,       errorMessage: Resource.msg('error.technical', 'checkout', null);   });   return next(); } const stripeCheckoutHelper = require('int_stripe_core').getCheckoutHelper(); const order = stripeCheckoutHelper.createOrder(currentBasket);  if (!order) {   res.json({     error: true,     errorMessage: Resource.msg('error.technical', 'checkout', null);   });   return next(); }`\n\nUpdate the order placement code:\n\n`var isAPMOrder = stripeCheckoutHelper.isAPMORder(order);  if (!isAPMOrder) {   var stripePaymentInstrument = stripeCheckoutHelper.getStripePaymentInstrument(order);    if (stripePaymentInstrument && order.custom.stripeIsPaymentIntentInReview) {     res.json({       error: false,       orderID: order.orderNo,       orderToken: order.orderToken,       continueUrl: URLUtils.url('Order-Confirm').toString()     });      return next();   }   // Places the order   var placeOrderResult = COHelpers.placeOrder(order, fraudDetectionStatus);    if(placeOrderResult.error) {     stripeCheckoutHelper.refundCharge(order);     res.json({       error: true,       errorMessage: Resource.msg('error.technical', 'checkout', null)     });   const fraudDetectionStatus = hooksHelper(     'app.fraud.detection',     'fraudDetection',     currentBasket,     require('*/cartridge/scripts/hooks/fraudDetection').fraudDetection   );    if (fraudDetectionStatus.status === 'fail') {     Transaction.wrap(function () {       OrderMgr.failOrder(order);     });      // Fraud detection failed     req.session.privacyCache.set('fraudDetectionStatus', true);      res.json({       error: true,       cartError: true,       redirectUrl: URLUtils.url('Error-ErrorCode', 'err', fraudDetectionStatus.errorCode).toString(),       errorMessage: Resource.msg('error.technical', 'checkout', null);     });     return next();   }   COHelpers.sendConfirmationEmail(order, req.locale.id);    // Reset usingMultiShip after successful Order placement   req.session.privacyCache.set('usingMultiShip', false);    res.json({     error: false,     orderID: order.orderNo,     orderToken: order.orderToken,     continueUrl: URLUtils.url('Order-Confirm').toString()   });    return next(); }`\n\n### Controller: PaymentInstruments.js ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nPath: `app_stripe_sfra/cartridge/controllers/PaymentInstruments.js`\n\nReplace the `DeletePayment` endpoint with the following code:\n\n`server.replace('DeletePayment', function(req, res, next) {   var stripeHelper = require ('int_stripe_core').getStripeHelper();   var wallet = stripeHelper.getStripeWallet(customer);   var UUID = req.querystring.UUID;   wallet.removePaymentInstrument({ custom: { stripeId: UUID }});    res.json({  UUID: UUID });   next(); });`\n\n### Controller: RedirectURL.js ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nPath: `app_stripe_sfra/cartridge/controllers/RedirectURL.js`\n\nAdd the following code to the `Start` function:\n\n`server.replace('Start', function (req, res, next) {   const URLRedirectMgr = require('dw/web/URLRedirectMgr');    // Intercept the incoming path request   if (URLRedirectMgr.getRedirectOrigin() === '/.well-known/apple-developer-merchantid-domain-association') {     res.render('stripe/util/apple');     return next();   }    const redirect = URLRedirectMgr.redirect;   const location = redirect ? redirect.location : null;   const redirectStatus = redirect ? redirect.getStatus() : null;    if (!location) {     res.setStatusCode(404);     res.render('error/notFound');   } else {     if (redirectStatus) {       res.setRedirectStatus(redirectStatus);     }     res.redirect(location);   }    return next(); });`\n\n## External interfaces![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nStripe functionality relies heavily on external calls to Stripe services. All external interfaces use the service framework to communicate with the Stripe API.\n\nStripe accounts are free to create and use. Most communications with Stripe services are logged and accessible in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/). We encourage you to use the Stripe Dashboard to monitor and test your integration. You can find the main configuration for integration of the Stripe services under Administration > Operations > Services with a different service for each external call:\n\n*   `stripe.http.addCard`\n*   `stripe.http.authorizePayment`\n*   `stripe.http.createCharge`\n*   `stripe.http.createCustomer`\n*   `stripe.http.deleteCard`\n*   `stripe.http.fetchCustomerCards`\n*   `stripe.http.fetchCustomerSources`\n*   `stripe.http.refundCharge`\n*   `stripe.http.retrieveCustomer`\n*   `stripe.http.service`\n*   `stripe.http.updateCard`\n\nAll of these services use the same profile and the same credentials. The only thing that may be different is whether or not the communication log is enabled and the log name prefix. Here is the configuration of some of the services:\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/salesforce-addcard.af39346a7b5255e74be8acaa145593bc.png)\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/salesforce-authorize.f02620c9923d170c73748fa7499339ef.png)\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/salesforce-createcharge.3370eca839412304ffe706cecdcc942c.png)\n\n## Stripe Payment Element![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nStripe cartridge supports Stripe Payment Element as a payment method.\n\nThe Payment Element is an embedded UI component that lets you accept up to 25+ payment methods with a single integration.\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/payment-element.d9f32fe8ddd882f9cfe67f2b0d915b33.png)\n\nTo enable the Payment Element, navigate to **Business Manager > Merchant Tools > Ordering > Payment Methods** and enable the payment method with ID set to `STRIPE_PAYMENT_ELEMENT`. In storefront Checkout > Payment, there is a widget with all payment methods enabled in the Stripe [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods).\n\nWhen you enable Payment Element in Business Manager, it can replace all other payment methods. You can disable all payment methods and use `STRIPE_PAYMENT_ELEMENT` instead.\n\nTo enable saving of payment methods for future use from Stripe Payment Element, navigate to **Business Manager > Custom Preferences > Stripe Configs** and set **Stripe Payment Element: Enable Save Payment Method for Future Purchases** to `Yes`.\n\nTo display a list of saved payment methods in checkout, navigate to **Business Manager > Payments Methods** and enable the `CREDIT_CARD` payment method. When it’s enabled with `STRIPE_PAYMENT_ELEMENT`, the credit card tab includes a list saved cards (if any).\n\n## Stripe Radar insights display![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nStripe LINK cartridge supports Radar insights view to showcase risk insights within the Orders section of Business Manager. [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar) provides real-time fraud protection and requires no additional development time. Fraud professionals can add [Radar for Fraud Teams](https://stripe.com/radar/fraud-teams) to customize protection and get deeper insights.\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/radar-insights.be63001444ae6c6898ac8de4a13ae00e.png)\n\nTo enable the insights display, navigate to **Business Manager > Merchant Tools > Custom Preferences > Stripe Configs** and set **Risk Score Data** to `Yes`.\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/radar-configuration.54078bec7ed35de180bec62625dfde96.png)",

However, the test cards only work while using your test secret and publishable API keys. You can’t use real credit card numbers with your test API keys.\n\nYou should monitor and test the integration against the Stripe Dashboard before going live. Stripe functions largely the same with both test and live transactions (aside from what credit card numbers you can use) . After you’ve completed and tested your integration, change your two Stripe API keys to take your integration live.\n\n## Checkout![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n1.

Import Customer records (required fields).\n    *   Account Name\n    *   Stripe [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/retrieve) ID\n2.  Import payment method records (required fields).\n    *   Payment Gateway record ID\n    *   Active checkbox set to True\n    *   Payment Gateway Token\n\n[](#section-2)\n\nTo import existing customers and payment methods, the Salesforce Admin needs to do the following:\n\n1.  Insert the Account record:\n    *   Because the Account records already exist in Salesforce, Account records updated with the Stripe [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/retrieve) ID. There are multiple ways to match to an existing Account (such as an ID or Account Name).\n2.  Import payment methods required fields.\n    *   Payment Gateway record ID\n    *   Active checkbox set to **True**\n    *   Payment Gateway Token\n    *   Stripe [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/retrieve) ID\n\n[](#section-3)\n\nTo import only payment methods, the Salesforce Admin needs to do the following:\n\n1.

The connector doesn’t support creating and charging Payment Methods simultaneously from the Payment Center.\n\nThis problem occurs when a new payment is entered, and save this payment for later use is selected.\n\n[](#section-5)\n\nStripe recommends setting the Payment creation batch size in Salesforce Billing to the upper limit, which is currently 70.\n\n1.

A logical loop occurs when one set of resources repeatedly detects and responds to updates from another set. For instance, if a flow listens to Stripe’s `customer.updated` events and then updates a Salesforce `Account`, but another flow is set up to detect updates to the Salesforce `Account` and then updates a Stripe customer, it creates a logical loop.

Follow the instructions in step 3 of [Set Up a Synchronous Payment Gateway Adapter in Salesforce](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.apexcode.meta/apexcode/apex_commercepayments_sync_adapter_setup.htm) to create a payment gateway provider. Here’s the set of values we recommend for the payload:\n    \n    `{ \"ApexAdapterId\": \"Output of this Query: SELECT Id FROM ApexClass WHERE Name IN ('StripeAdapter')\", \"DeveloperName\": \"StripeProvider\", \"MasterLabel\": \" StripeProvider\", \"IdempotencySupported\": \"No\", \"Comments\": \"Stripe Synchronous Payment Gateway Adapter\" }`\n    \n2.  Follow the instructions in step 4 of [Set Up a Synchronous Payment Gateway Adapter in Salesforce](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.apexcode.meta/apexcode/apex_commercepayments_sync_adapter_setup.htm) to create a payment gateway record.\n    \n    Recommended values:\n    \n    | Field Label | Value |\n    | --- | --- |\n    | Name | SALESFORCE\\_PAYMENTS |\n    | Merchant Credential ID | Output of this query: `SELECT Id FROM NamedCredential WHERE DeveloperName = 'StripeAPI'` |\n    | Payment Gateway Provider | Output of the query (modify the query accordingly if your Stripe Synchronous Payment Gateway Provider is different than ‘StripeProvider’): `SELECT Id FROM PaymentGatewayProvider WHERE DeveloperName ='StripeProvider'` |\n    | Status | Active |\n    \n\n### Configure a Stripe Asynchronous Payment Gateway Adapter![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n1.  Follow the instructions in [Set Up an Asynchronous Payment Gateway Adapter in Salesforce](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.apexcode.meta/apexcode/apex_commercepayments_async_adapter_setup.htm) to configure the Stripe Asynchronous Payment Gateway Adapter (skip step 2 and 3 if you’ve already executed the same for the Stripe Synchronous Payment Gateway Adapter). To create an asynchronous Payment Gateway Provider (follow step 4 from the previously linked instruction). Here is the recommended set of values for the payload:\n    \n    `{ \"ApexAdapterId\": \"Output of this Query: SELECT Id FROM ApexClass WHERE Name IN (‘StripeAsyncAdapter’)\",   \"DeveloperName\": \"StripeAsyncAdapter\",   \"MasterLabel\": \" StripeAsyncAdapterProvider \",   \"IdempotencySupported\": \"No\",   \"Comments\": \"Stripe Asynchronous Payment Gateway Adapter\"   }`\n    \n2.  Follow the instruction from step 5 (Create a payment gateway record) in [Set Up an Asynchronous Payment Gateway Adapter in Salesforce](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.apexcode.meta/apexcode/apex_commercepayments_async_adapter_setup.htm) to register the Stripe Asynchronous Payment Gateway record in Salesforce.\n    \n    Here are the recommended values for the fields to be inserted (if you’re creating a gateway record for the first time) or updated (if you have already created a gateway record while setting up the synchronous payment gateway adapter)\n    \n    | Field Label | Value |\n    | --- | --- |\n    | Name | SALESFORCE\\_PAYMENTS |\n    | Merchant Credential ID | Output of this query: `SELECT Id FROM NamedCredential WHERE DeveloperName = 'StripeAPI'` |\n    | Payment Gateway Provider | Output of the query (modify the query accordingly if your Stripe Synchronous Payment Gateway Provider is different than ‘StripeProvider’): `SELECT Id FROM PaymentGatewayProvider WHERE DeveloperName ='StripeAsyncAdapter'.` |\n    | Status | Active |\n    \n3.  Follow the instructions in step 6 to configure the webhook URL for Stripe. The typical format of the webhook URL is a publicly accessible, HTTPS URL. For example: https://mydomainname.my.salesforce-sites.com/subdomain/services/data/v\\[Replace\\_ME\\_version\\]/commerce/payments/notify%20?provider=<ID>\n    \n    `SELECT Id FROM PaymentGatewayProvider WHERE DeveloperName = ‘StripeAsyncAdapter’`\n    \n    \\[Replace\\_ME\\_version\\] with the API version of your org 49.0 and later\n    \n4.  Use the following steps to register your webhooks URL in Stripe:\n    \n    1.  Login to the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/dashboard).\n    2.  Go to the [Developers Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/developers).\n    3.  Click **Webhooks**.\n    4.  Click **Add Endpoint**.\n    5.  Enter your webhooks URL, then add the following events: `charge.refunded`, `charge.succeeded`, `charge.captured`.\n5.  Click **Add Endpoint**.\n    \n6.  Copy your webhook signing secret and save it for later use.\n    \n    ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/sfom-stripe-copy-wh-secret.12c174e1793e7de05383881becda2805.png)\n    \n\n## Complete the configurations using Stripe OM Setup![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nInstructions in the following sections detail how to complete the configuration of your integration.\n\nIn your Salesforce Order Management org, go through the Stripe Setup Assistant to connect your org to your Stripe account.\n\n1.  Click the App Launcher, then click **View All**.\n    \n    ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/sfom-launch-app-launcher.abb6c08a1cde704115918ebaddfe3ff4.png)\n    \n2.  Click **Stripe OM Setup**.\n    \n    ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/sfom-launch-om-setup.d84d6c532e02356ab40073b2bec20f14.png)\n    \n3.  Click **Get Started**.\n    \n4.  Toggle live mode. We recommend leaving live mode disabled to test your Stripe integration without affecting your live data, and activating live mode when you’re ready to start processing real transactions with the Stripe Payment Gateway. Come back to this step and reauthorize your connection to switch between test mode and live mode. If you’re in live mode and you want to switch back to test mode, you don’t need to re-authorize.\n    \n5.  Click **Authorize**.\n    \n    ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/sfom-authorize.d4883cff2b90cce49e6054a05daa9079.png)\n    \n    This allows Salesforce to access your Stripe data so you can capture and refund payments. The Stripe website opens to complete the authorization process, which might require you to enter login information or activate your Stripe account. When done, you’re redirected to this page to finish the setup process. After authorization is complete and successful, the following message displays:\n    \n    ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/sfom-authorize-complete.8ff6523255d2652a3dacaa56304c0090.png)\n    \n    Store the webhook signing secret for Stripe asynchronous payment processing.\n    \n    ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/sfom-store-wh-secret.9918a70a19d3886755228a68102c1979.png)\n    \n    1.  Add the webhook signing secret value in **Signing secret**.\n    2.  Click **Update**.\n    3.  A message appears on top to confirm successful insertion. Click **Finish**.\n\n### Modify existing order management flows![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe authentication with Stripe is using OAuth, where Stripe is the OAuth provider. Salesforce doesn’t support Stripe as an OAuth provider, therefore the OAuth token is obtained using a custom integration, leveraging an invocable action **getAccesToken**. This is packaged as part of the Stripe OM Connector Managed Package.\n\nIdentify the flow that initiates the payment or refund to Stripe and include the **getAccessToken** invocable method in an action just before the **Ensure Funds** action in the flow (as shown in the following example). The flows that you need to modify varies from the one shown in the following example.\n\n1.  Navigate to **Setup > Process Automation > Flows**.\n2.  Select the active **Flow** to use to capture funds.\n3.  Create a new **Action** that calls the `getAccessToken` invocable method.\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/sfom-generate-token.4e707e9311288fd5e7f6e93a47dc638d.png)\n\n1.  Make sure that the **Get Access Token** action occurs before the **Capture Funds** action. After it completes, save a new version of this **Flow** to make sure that your processes use the new version.\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/sfom-flowbuilder.22b239ea431eca499ef4cddd690ade94.png)\n\n1.  You can now use Stripe Payment as a payment method in your Order Management org. You can now place orders from Salesforce B2C Commerce Cloud and complete transactions, such as capture and refund transactions for payment methods that are associated with Salesforce commerce payments.",

To find the `PaymentIntent` in Salesforce Order Management, locate the Gateway Reference Number (`GatewayRefNumber`) field against the payment authorization record for an order summary.\n\nA payment authorization is relevant to both Stripe and the Salesforce OMS. An authorized amount is a sum that a business transmits to a credit or debit card processor to make sure a customer has sufficient funds to complete a purchase—the approved amount of money to be charged.\n\nThere are two [capture modes](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-capture_method) in the Stripe LINK cartridge for Salesforce B2C Commerce Cloud—authorize and capture. If the LINK cartridge is setup to authorize a payment during checkout, then a payment authorization record is created in Salesforce Order Management. You can view the payment authorization against an order summary using this route:\n\n**Order Summary Record > Order Payment Summary Record > Payment Authorizations in Related Tab**\n\nIf you don’t see `Refunds` in the **Related** tab, contact your Salesforce administrator and include the payment authorization related list in the page layout (as shown):\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/sfom-payment-auth-sc1.bb4f7cb8c5bce6a76d45fa975c210894.png)\n\nThe PaymentIntent ID (`pi_XXXXXX`) at Stripe is stored in the Gateway Reference Number (`GatewayRefNumber`) field of the payment authorization record. The Processing Mode (`ProcessingMode`) is set as `External`, which implies that the payment authorization was processed outside the Salesforce payment platform.\n\n## Payment![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nIf the capture mode in the Stripe LINK cartridge is set to `Capture`, then the payment is captured from the customer. In this case, a payment record is created in Salesforce Order Management. You can view the payment against an Order Summary using this route:\n\n**Order Summary Record > Order Payment Summary Record > Payments in Related Tab**\n\nIf you don’t see `Refunds` in the **Related tab**, contact your Salesforce administrator and include the payments related list in the page layout (as shown):\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/sfom-payment-sc1.8c48be7fc8849db13914a5f363fba750.png)\n\n## Balance Transaction ID![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe Balance Transaction ID (`txn_XXXXXXXXX`) against the PaymentIntent (`pi_XXXXXX`) at Stripe is stored in the Gateway Reference Number (`GatewayRefNumber`) field. The Processing Mode (`ProcessingMode`) is set as `External`, which means the payment was processed outside the Salesforce payment platform. In the event the payment was authorized in Salesforce B2C Commerce Cloud Storefront, and the amount was captured in Salesforce OMS later, the payment record is represented as shown:\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/sfom-baltxn-sc1.7eae0d579cb7f583f4270517d7bd5ab3.png)\n\nThe Salesforce Payment Gateway Id (`SFXXXXX`) against the Payment Intent (`pi_XXXXXX`) at Stripe is stored in the Gateway Reference Number (`GatewayRefNumber`) field.

    "markdown": "# Test Stripe Invoicing | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Learn how to test your Invoicing integration.\n\nUse these common scenarios to test your invoicing integration before taking it live.\n\n## Test webhook notifications ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nStripe triggers event notifications when an [invoice’s](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices \"invoices\") [status changes](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/workflow-transitions#status-transitions-endpoints). After you set up the Stripe CLI and link to your Stripe account, you can test webhooks by:\n\n*   Triggering event notifications with the [Stripe CLI](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-cli).\n    \n*   Using the Dashboard to [create invoices](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/invoices/create) in [test mode](https://docs.stripe.com/test-mode \"test mode\").\n    \n\nYou can add an endpoint and see its received events by going to [Webhooks](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/webhooks) in the Dashboard.\n\n### Test events with fake data ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nBy using the Stripe CLI to trigger events, you can see event notifications on your server as they come in. This means that you can check your webhook integration directly without complicating factors such as network tunnels or firewalls. When you use the Stripe CLI, the event your webhook receives contains fake data that doesn’t correlate to invoice information.\n\n### Test events with real data ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nThe most reliable way to test webhook notifications is to create test invoices for existing customers and handle the corresponding events.\n\n## Test payment failures ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nTo trigger payment failures for invoices, you can use the test credit card numbers in [Declined payments](https://docs.stripe.com/testing#declined-payments). If you want to simulate a declined payment for a card that’s been successfully attached to a customer, use **4000 0000 0000 0341** as their default payment method.\n\nDepending on your [retry settings](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/automatic-collection), you might have to wait a day or more to see the first retry attempt. To see what happens for a successful retry, you can use this waiting period to update the customer’s payment method to a working test card.\n\n## Test payments that require 3D Secure ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nUse the [**4000 0000 0000 3063**](https://docs.stripe.com/testing#regulatory-cards) card to simulate 3D Secure triggering for invoices. (You can also write [custom Radar rules](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/radar/rules) in test mode to trigger authentication.) When Stripe triggers a 3D Secure authentication, you can test authenticating or failing the payment attempt in the 3DS dialog that opens. If the payment is authenticated successfully, the invoice is paid. When a payment attempt fails, the authentication attempt is unsuccessful and the invoice remains `open`.\n\n## Test bank transfer payments ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nTo test manual payments on invoices through bank transfers:\n\n1.  Create a testmode invoice with the collection method set to `send_invoice` and `payment_settings[payment_method_types]` array set to `[customer_balance]`.\n    \n2.  Find the invoice in the Dashboard and click **Send**. This generates a unique virtual bank account number for your customer.\n    \n3.  Retrieve your customer’s unique virtual bank account number using the \\[Customer Balance Funding Instructions API)(/docs/payments/customer-balance/funding-instructions#create-funding-instructions). You can also find your customer’s virtual banking details in the Hosted Invoice Page and PDF.\n    \n\n## Test customer tax ID verification ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nUse these magic tax IDs to trigger certain verification conditions in test mode. The tax ID type must be either the EU VAT Number or Australian Business Number (ABN).\n\n| Number | Type |\n| --- | --- |\n| `000000000` | Successful verification |\n| `111111111` | Unsuccessful verification |\n| `222222222` | Verification remains pending indefinitely |",

Boleto is a voucher with a generated number that [Customers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers \"Customers\") can obtain from an ATM, a bank, an online bank portal, or an authorized agency.\n\n[](#enable-boleto)\n\nBefore you start your integration, go to **Manage payments that require confirmation** in your [Subscriptions and emails settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/automatic) and enable **Send a Stripe-hosted link for customers to confirm their payments when required**.\n\n### Use Stripe Checkout Subscriptions only![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nIf you create a subscription that uses [Stripe Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions), Stripe sends your customer a previously generated Boleto to their email address in each subscription cycle.\n\n1.  Go to your [Payment methods settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) and turn on Boleto as a payment method.\n    \n2.

For invoices, you can choose to either send an invoice or charge your customer automatically. If you’re using the API, the `send_invoice` and `charge_automatically` values determine the collection method.\n\n|     | Send invoice | Charge automatically |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| When to use | *   Your customer hasn’t defined their preferred payment method to pay invoices or subscriptions. In this case, you want to give them the option to use either a credit card or Boleto.<br>*   You’re missing important customer information required to use Boleto (full name, address, and tax ID). | *   Your customer already chose to pay for their invoices or subscriptions using boletos.<br>*   You have the customer information needed to create an invoice that uses Boleto (full name, address, and tax ID). |\n| Customer experience | *   Your customer needs to reenter their personal information details (full name, address, and tax ID) every time you send a new invoice, or for each new subscription cycle. This collection method doesn’t take into account the default payment method associated with that customer. | *   Your customer has Boleto set up as their default payment method. Your customer receives an email with a Boleto voucher every time you send them an invoice, or there’s a subscription cycle. |\n| Expiration and due dates | *   The invoice must contain a due date.<br>*   Stripe creates the boleto—regardless of the invoice due date—as soon as your customer enters the needed details. Because boletos have their own expiration date (the default is 3 days), the invoice due date and the boleto expiration date won’t necessarily match. The boleto might expire before or after the invoice is due. | *   The invoice doesn’t have a due date.<br>*   Stripe creates the boleto when the merchant creates the invoice with a selected expiration date (the default is 3 days). |\n\n[](#create-customers)\n\nCreate a customer for every new user or business you want to bill. When you create a new customer, set up a [minimal customer profile](#customer-profile) to help generate more useful invoices, and enable Smart Retries (if you’re an [Invoicing Plus](https://stripe.com/invoicing/pricing) user). After you set up your customer, you can issue one-off invoices or create [subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/creating \"subscriptions\").\n\n#### Caution\n\nBefore you create a new customer, make sure that the customer doesn’t already exist in the Dashboard. Creating multiple customer entries for the same customer can cause you problems later on, such as when you need to reconcile transaction history or coordinate saved payment methods.\n\nYou can create and manage customers on the [Customers page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/customers) when you don’t want to use code to create a customer, or if you want to manually bill a customer with a one-off invoice.\n\n#### Note\n\nYou can also create a customer in the Dashboard during invoice creation.\n\n### Create a customer ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nWhen you create a new customer, you can set their account and billing information, such as **Email**, **Name**, and **Country**. You can also set a customer’s preferred language, currency, and other important details.\n\nTo create a customer, complete these steps:\n\n1.  Verify that the customer doesn’t already exist.\n    \n2.  Click **Add customer**, or press **N**, on the **Customers** page.\n    \n3.  At a minimum, enter your customer’s **Name** and **Account email**.\n    \n4.

Find the customer you want to delete on the **Customers** page.\n    \n2.  Click the checkbox next to your customer’s name followed by **Delete**. You can also click into the customer’s details page and select **Actions** > **Delete customer**.\n    \n\n[](#create-product-price)\n\nDefine all your business and product offerings in one place. [Products](https://docs.stripe.com/api/products \"Products\") define what you sell and [Prices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices \"Prices\") track how much and how often to charge. This is a core entity within Stripe that works with [subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/creating \"subscriptions\"), [invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices \"invoices\"), and [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout).\n\nPrices enable these use cases:\n\n*   A software provider that charges a one-time setup fee whenever a user creates a new subscription.\n*   An e-commerce store that sends a recurring box of goods for 10 USD per month and wants to allow customers to purchase one-time add-ons.\n*   A professional services firm that can now create a standard list of services and choose from that list per invoice instead of typing out each line item by hand.\n*   A non-profit organization that allows donors to define a custom recurring donation amount per customer.\n\nYou can manage your product catalog with products and prices. Products define what you sell and prices track how much and how often to charge. Manage your products and their prices in the Dashboard or through the API.\n\nIf you used the Dashboard in test mode to set up your business, you can copy each of your products over to live mode by using **Copy to live mode** in the [Product catalog page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/products). Use our official libraries to access the Stripe API from your application.\n\n1.  Navigate to the **Product catalog** page, and click **Add product**.\n    \n2.  Select whether you want to create a **One-time product**, or a **Recurring one-time product**.\n    \n3.  Give your product a name, and assign it a price.\n    \n\n[](#create-subscription)\n\nYou can create and update subscriptions from the Dashboard or the API. Use the API if you have a large number of subscriptions to manage, or if you want to manage them programmatically.\n\n#### Note\n\n### Create a subscription ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nTo create a subscription:\n\n1.  Go to the **Payments** > **Subscriptions** page.\n    \n2.  Click **+Create subscription**.\n    \n3.  Find or add a customer.\n    \n4.  Enter the pricing and product information, which allows you to add multiple products, a coupon, or trial to the subscription.\n    \n\nIn the **Advanced** options section, you can optionally create [thresholds for metered usage](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/pricing-models#usage-based-pricing) or add [customized invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/customize) fields. When you’re finished, click **Schedule subscription** or **Start subscription**. When scheduling a subscription you can start it immediately, the next month, or customize it. You can end the subscription immediately, after a number of cycles, or customize a date.\n\n### Edit a subscription ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nTo edit a subscription:\n\n1.  Go to the **Payments** > **Subscriptions** page.\n    \n2.  Find the subscription you want to modify, click the overflow menu (), then click **Update subscription**. You can also click the next to the subscription name. From this menu, you can also:\n    \n    *   **Cancel the subscription**. In the modal that opens, select the date to cancel the subscription—immediately, at the end of the current period, or on a custom date. You can also select the option to refund the last payment for this subscription and create a [credit note](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/dashboard/credit-notes) for your records.\n        \n    *   **Pause payment collection**. In the modal that opens, select the duration of the pause—indefinite or ending on a custom date, and how invoices should behave during the pause.\n        \n    *   **Share payment update link**. In the modal that opens, you can share a link with the customer to update their payment details. For more information, see [Share payment update link](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/update-payment-method).\n        \n3.  Add the changes you want to the subscription.\n    \n4.

    "markdown": "# API and advanced usage | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Learn advanced strategies for using test clocks in the Dashboard and API.\n\nYou can create a test clock separately from a subscription for running advanced simulations. In this scenario you create the test clock first and then add different test cases to it.\n\nNot ready for a full integration? See [our guide](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/testing/test-clocks/simulate-subscriptions) for running simulations on subscriptions.\n\n![How to set a test clock to simulate subscription time elpasing.](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/test-clock-lifecycle.b711b9cf4feb52351e27958b8b924cb3.png)\n\nTest clock lifecycle\n\nFollow these steps to start using test clocks:\n\n1.  [Create a test clock](#create-clock)\n2.  [Set up your testing simulation](#setup-simulation)\n3.  [Advance the clock’s time](#advance-clock)\n4.  [Monitor and handle the changes](#monitor-changes)\n5.  [Update the simulation](#update-simulation)\n6.  [Delete the clock](#delete-clock)\n\nYou can advance the clock’s time, monitor changes, and update the simulation as often as you need to test different cases.\n\n[](#create-clock)\n\nTo start a simulation, create a clock and set its frozen time. The temporal starting point for all [subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/creating \"subscriptions\") associated with this clock. You can set this to a time in the future or in the past to test different simulations, but you can only move it forward in time after you set it.\n\nTo create a test clock in the Dashboard, follow the steps below. Set the Dashboard to **Test mode** to use test clocks.\n\n1.  Go to the **Subscriptions** [section](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/subscriptions) under the **Billing** tab.\n2.  Click the [test clocks](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/test-clocks) link in the banner.\n3.  Click **New simulation**.\n4.  In the **Create new simulation** modal, enter a name for the simulation. You can use this to describe the simulation you’re testing, like `Annual renewal` or `Free trial`.\n5.  Set the frozen time of the clock. This is the starting point for your simulation. You can set this to a time in the future or in the past, but you can only move it forward in time after you set it.\n\n[](#setup-simulation)\n\nNext, set up the test case for your simulation. You need to create a customer first, then a subscription for them.\n\nTo create a customer for your simulation through the Dashboard:\n\n1.  Go to the [test clocks](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/test-clocks) page and find your test clock.\n2.  Click **Add** > **Add customer**.\n\nYou can’t choose existing customers during test clock simulations. You can add up to three new customers to each simulation.\n\nYou can optionally enter other [available properties](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/customer#properties-uses) for the customer, like their name, email, and billing information, but none are required. For some simulations, like testing free trials, you might not want to collect any billing information up front.\n\nNext, you can create up to three subscriptions or subscription schedules for your customer. To create a subscription for the customer through the Dashboard:\n\n1.  Go to the [test clocks](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/test-clocks) page and find your test clock.\n    \n2.  Click **Add** > **Add subscription**. Select or search for your customer from the drop-down menu. You can also add the customer to a subscription through the customer page, by clicking **Actions** > **Create subscription**.\n    \n3.  Select a recurring product and price in the **Pricing** section.\n    \n4.  For the **Subscription schedule**, define the start and end date for the subscription and when to start the billing cycle.\n    \n5.  Choose a payment collection method:\n    \n    *   Select **Automatically charge a payment method on file** if you want to charge your customer when the billing cycle starts.\n    *   Select **Email invoice to the customer to pay manually** if you want to invoice your customer in arrears.\n6.  Click **Start test subscription** to start the subscription and billing cycle.\n    \n\nBoth the customer and subscription objects are associated with the clock object you created in the [first step](#create-clock). In the Dashboard, the icon indicates that an object is associated with a clock.\n\n[](#advance-clock)\n\nAfter you’ve created the test clock and set up your test case, advance the simulated time of the clock. The first time you do this, you’ll advance the time from the initial frozen time you set at the [creation of the clock](#create-clock). As you advance time, you can see how your integration works when subscriptions end, renew, or undergo other changes (like upgrading from a free trial to a paid subscription).\n\nYou can advance test clocks by any increment, but you can only advance them two intervals at a time from their initial frozen time. The length of the interval is based on the shortest subscription interval associated with the test clock, which is determined by the recurring price. For example, if you have a monthly subscription, you can only advance the clock up to two months at a time. If the test clock has no subscriptions or subscription schedules, you can advance it up to two years from the initial frozen time.\n\nTo advance time through the Dashboard:\n\n1.  Go to the [test clocks](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/test-clocks) page and find your test clock.\n    \n2.  Click **Advance time**.\n    \n3.  Use the calendar modal to select the date you want to advance the clock to.\n    \n4.  Click **Advance**.\n    \n\nWhen the clock is done advancing, the banner updates and displays the clock’s current time.\n\n[](#monitor-changes)\n\nAfter a successful API request or Dashboard operation, the clock takes a few seconds to advance to the specified time. To know when the clock has changed state, you can use webhooks to listen for event notifications or you can poll the clock. The Dashboard also reflects the changes. For example, you can go to the [invoices page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/invoices) to check whether an invoice was created or paid for your subscription.\n\nIf you use [webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks), listen to the following event notifications. Before production, make sure your integration correctly handles the other [billing-specific event notifications](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/webhooks) in addition to the ones listed below.\n\n| Event | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `test_helpers.test_clock.advancing` | The clock has started to advance but hasn’t reached the specified time. |\n| `test_helpers.test_clock.ready` | The clock has completed advancing to the specified time. |\n\nTo poll the state of the clock, [retrieve](https://docs.stripe.com/api/test_clocks/retrieve) it by ID to examine its `status`.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/test_helpers/test_clocks/{{CLOCK_ID}} \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\"`\n\n[](#update-simulation)\n\nYou can continue to make changes to your simulation and [advance the clock](#advance-clock) for simulations like:\n\n*   Adding a [customer balance](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/customer/balance).\n*   Making a mid-cycle upgrade.\n*   [Adding one-off invoice items](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/invoices/subscription#adding-upcoming-invoice-items).\n\nAfter each update, [monitor the changes](#monitor-changes) again. Repeat as many times as you need to satisfy your test case.\n\n[](#delete-clock)\n\nTest clocks are automatically deleted 30 days after you create them, but you can delete them when you’re done testing to ensure a clean test environment.\n\nTo delete the clock and all of its associated test objects through the Dashboard:\n\n1.  Go to the [test clocks](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/test-clocks) page and find your test clock.\n2.  Click **Finish simulation**.\n3.  In the confirmation modal, click **Finish**.\n\nDeleting the clock also deletes the test customers associated with the clock and cancels their subscriptions. Test clocks are only available in test mode, so you can’t delete any production objects when you delete a clock.\n\n[](#use-cases)\n\n### Test subscription renewals ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nFirst, follow these steps to start using test clocks:\n\n1.  [Create a test clock](#create-clock)\n2.  [Set up your testing simulation](#setup-simulation)\n3.  [Advance the clock’s time](#advance-clock)\n4.  [Monitor and handle the changes](#monitor-changes)\n5.  [Update the simulation](#update-simulation)\n\nNext, you can test certain subscription renewals using test clocks. Let’s say that you’d like to test that a 50 USD/month subscription renews correctly. To simulate this situation using test clocks:\n\n*   Create a new test clock and set its `frozen_time` to January 1.\n*   Add a customer and add a payment method for the customer:\n\nTo add a payment method for a customer in the Dashboard:\n\n1.  From the customer account page, click **Add > Add card** from the **Payment methods** section.\n2.  Enter payment information. In this case, use the [test card](https://docs.stripe.com/testing#cards).\n3.  Click **Add card** in the modal.\n\n*   After adding a payment method for the customer, create a subscription for the new customer set at 50 USD/month. In doing so, the invoice of 50 USD is paid automatically and the subscription is `active`.\n    \n*   Advance the date to February 1 to see that an invoice of 50 USD is created. By default, the invoice appears in a `draft` state for [one hour](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/invoices/subscription#adding-draft-invoice-items).\n    \n*   Advance the time by one hour to see that the invoice is finalized and paid automatically.\n    \n\n### Test mid-cycle upgrades with prorations ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nFirst, follow these steps to start using test clocks:\n\n1.  [Create a test clock](#create-clock)\n2.  [Set up your testing simulation](#setup-simulation)\n3.  [Advance the clock’s time](#advance-clock)\n4.  [Monitor and handle the changes](#monitor-changes)\n5.  [Update the simulation](#update-simulation)\n\nNext, you can test prorations for customers who upgrade their plans in the middle of a billing cycle. Let’s say that you have two products. One product is 50 USD/month (‘basic plan’) and the other is 100 USD/month (‘premium plan’). In this case, you may want to test prorations for a customer who upgrades their ‘basic plan’ to the ‘premium plan’ in the middle of a billing cycle. To simulate this situation using test clocks:\n\n*   Create a new test clock and set its `frozen_time` to January 1.\n*   Create a customer and add their payment method. In this case, use the [test card](https://docs.stripe.com/testing#cards).\n*   Create a subscription for the ‘basic plan’ at 50 USD/month. After this is done, you’ll see that the 50 USD/month invoice is created, finalized, and automatically paid.\n*   Advance the date by two weeks. In this case, we’ll set the date to January 16.\n*   Upgrade the subscription to a ‘premium plan’ at 100 USD/month:\n\nTo upgrade a subscription using the Dashboard:\n\n1.  From the customer account page or the subscription details page, click the overflow menu () associated with a subscription, then select **Update subscription**.\n2.  Make your desired modifications.\n3.  Click **Update subscription** in the top right corner to apply the changes.\n\n*   After upgrading the subscription, the [customer.subscription.updated](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-customer.subscription.updated) webhook event is created.\n    \n*   Pending invoice items are also created for the prorations. You’ll see a negative proration of -25 USD for the unused time with the ‘basic plan’ and a positive proration of 50 USD for using the ‘premium plan’ for half of the remaining month. At this point, no invoice has been generated.\n    \n*   Advance the date by two weeks. In this case, we’ll set the date to February 1. You’ll see that the subscription has cycled. An invoice has been generated in a `draft` state and has incorporated the pending invoice items, including a negative proration, a positive proration, and the total payment for the month of February, resulting in 125 USD. By default, the invoice appears in a `draft` state for around [one hour](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/invoices/subscription#adding-draft-invoice-items).\n    \n*   To finalize the invoice, advance the time by one hour.\n    \n\n### Test trials ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nFirst, follow these steps to start using test clocks:\n\n1.  [Create a test clock](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/testing/test-clocks/api-advanced-usage#create-clock)\n2.  [Set up your testing simulation](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/testing/test-clocks/api-advanced-usage#setup-simulation)\n3.  [Advance the clock’s time](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/testing/test-clocks/api-advanced-usage#advance-clock)\n4.  [Monitor and handle the changes](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/testing/test-clocks/api-advanced-usage#monitor-changes)\n5.  [Update the simulation](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/testing/test-clocks/api-advanced-usage#update-simulation)\n\nNext, you can start testing trials with test clocks. Let’s say that you want customers to try your product for free with a seven-day trial before they start paying and want to collect payment information up front. To simulate this situation using test clocks, follow these steps:\n\n*   Create a new test clock and set its `frozen_time` to January 1.\n*   Add a customer and include their payment method. In this case, use a [test card](https://docs.stripe.com/testing#cards).\n*   Create a subscription and add a seven-day free trial period:\n\nTo add a trial period to an existing subscription using the Dashboard:\n\nFind the subscription you want to change.\n\n1.  Click **Actions**.\n2.  Click **Update subscription**.\n3.  Click **Add free trial** and enter seven in **Free trial days** field.\n4.  Click **Update subscription**.\n\n*   After creating a subscription with a seven-day free trial period, a subscription is created in a `trialing` state. An invoice of $0.00 is generated due to the free trial.\n*   Advance the date to January 5 to see the [customer.subscription.trial\\_will\\_end](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-customer.subscription.trial_will_end) event notification. Stripe sends the notification three days before the trial ends. You can use this webhook event to inform your customers that the trial ends soon.\n*   Advance the date to January 8 to see that the subscription is now `paid` and an invoice for 50 USD is created.\n*   Advance the date by one cycle (for example, to February 8 for a monthly subscription) to see the subscription renew successfully.\n\n## Limitations ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nFor efficient advancement of test clocks, Stripe limits the complexity of each simulation to:\n\n*   three customers\n*   three subscriptions, including [scheduled subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/subscription-schedules), per customer\n*   ten quotes that aren’t attached to customers\n\n### Caveats with payment processing![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nTest clock advancement currently doesn’t support collecting payments through bank debits (for example, `us_bank_account` payment method types). Stripe collects payments after the test clock advances. To test payment failures:\n\n1.  Choose the **Cancel subscription after all payment retries fail** setting.\n    \n2.  Attach a `us_bank_account` payment method type to a customer that fails payments.\n    \n3.  Create a subscription under the customer.\n    \n4.  Advance the test clock to cycle and collect payment on a subscription.\n    \n\nAfter the Test Clock advances, the subscription remains in the `active` state. This indicates that the payment collection hasn’t be attempted during test clock advancement, and the subscription has yet to enter the `canceled` state due to `payment_failed`.\n\nListen to the `invoice.payment_failed` event to monitor the delayed subscription state and invoice payment. The `customer.subscription.deleted` event indicates that the subscription state is set to `canceled`.",

    "markdown": "# How to start your business\n\n## Learn what you need to get started with Atlas.\n\nTo start a business using Stripe Atlas, you need to provide information about your company, founders, ownership, and company officers. Atlas provides legal information and self-serve tools that assist you in providing this information, filling out template documents, and filing these with the appropriate government offices. Atlas isn’t a law firm and doesn’t provide legal, tax, or accounting advice. Using Atlas isn’t a substitute for individual advice from qualified legal, tax, or accounting professionals.\n\nAtlas is appropriate for most founders, but not all. For example, if you’re contributing intellectual property (IP) to your company, Atlas’ use of a default, industry standard valuation might not accurately reflect the value of your IP. After you submit your information, Atlas fills out template entity formation documents. Double-check that the information you provided is accurate before submitting your Atlas application, because you likely need to work with a lawyer to make changes after your submission.\n\nWe charge 500 USD for company incorporation and then 100 USD annually each year to be your registered agent. We won’t charge you if you don’t submit, and we’ll refund your fee if we’re not able to support your business. Read more about Stripe’s [restricted businesses](https://support.stripe.com/questions/stripe-atlas-restricted-business-categories).\n\n#### Note\n\n## Information submission ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nReview the following table and submit the required information:\n\n| What we need | What to provide |\n| --- | --- |\n| Company structure | Select the type of entity structure that is right for you. Stripe Atlas supports forming Delaware C Corporations, Limited Liability Corporations (LLCs), and C Corporation subsidiaries. |\n| Company name | Enter a legal name for your company. The Atlas application will check if a name is available in the State of Delaware, but you can also check if a name is available on [Delaware’s website](https://icis.corp.delaware.gov/eCorp/EntitySearch/NameSearch.aspx). If you’re creating the new company as a subsidiary of an existing company, you also need to provide the following information about the existing parent company:<br><br>*   Parent company legal name<br>*   Parent company country<br>*   Parent company tax ID number |\n| Company description | Provide a few sentences to describe your company. We review this description to make sure that we can support your business. |\n| _(Optional)_ Company website | Provide a website or social media profile for your business. While this is optional, it helps us process your company more quickly. |\n| Company address | If you don’t have an official company address yet, you can use a virtual or home address. |\n| Company US phone number | You aren’t required to provide a company phone number to use Atlas. However, providing a phone number can expedite receiving your tax ID, which you need before you can accept payments through Stripe. We never call you for marketing purposes. |\n| Founders | We need to know a bit about you and any co-founders:<br><br>*   First and last name (that is, your name on a government ID)<br>*   Email address<br>*   Date of birth (only for the founder who submits the Atlas form)<br>*   Home address |\n| Ownership | Enter in the percentage of the company each founder owns (founder split) and reserve an equity pool for your team if you choose. |\n| Roles and officers | Choose your company’s role and officers:<br><br>*   Board of Directors (or LLC Managers): Choose who can make important company decisions.<br>*   C Corporation and Subsidiary roles: name a president and secretary for your company. The president is responsible for general company management. Your secretary is responsible for maintaining company records. |\n| Tax ID (Employer Identification Number or EIN) | Choose one of [two ways](#receive-tax-irs) to get your company’s tax ID (EIN) from the IRS: Standard (available to everyone) or Expedited (limited). |\n\n### Receive your Tax ID from the IRS ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nLearn more about the differences between standard and expedited processes when choosing to get your company’s Tax ID:\n\n*   Standard (available to everyone): 15–30 business days after incorporation.\n*   Expedited (limited): 1–2 business days after incorporation for no additional cost. Available if the account opener provides a US Social Security number (SSN), a US company address, and a US phone number.\n\nWe make a few assumptions when we submit your company’s EIN application to the IRS. We assume your company doesn’t:\n\n*   Have or expect to have any employees who will receive a Form W-2 in the next 12 months.\n*   Own a [highway motor vehicle](https://sa.www4.irs.gov/modiein/individual/help/keyword.jsp?keyword=Highway%20Motor%20Vehicle) with a [taxable gross weight](https://sa.www4.irs.gov/modiein/individual/help/keyword.jsp?keyword=Taxable%20Gross%20Weight) of 55,000 pounds or more.\n*   Need to file [Form 720](https://sa.www4.irs.gov/modiein/individual/help/keyword.jsp?keyword=Form%20%20720) (Quarterly Federal Excise Tax Return).\n*   Involve [gambling or wagering](https://sa.www4.irs.gov/modiein/individual/help/keyword.jsp?keyword=Gambling/Wagering).\n*   Sell or manufacture alcohol, tobacco, or firearms.\n\nIf any of the above assumptions are incorrect, you can simply file applicable employment taxes and/or excise taxes for your company.\n\n## How we use your information ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nStripe uses your information to generate the legal documents necessary to form your company in Delaware, get an [EIN](https://docs.stripe.com/atlas/business-taxes#file-us-corp-tax) from the IRS, and file your [83(b) election](https://docs.stripe.com/atlas/83b-election). We also review your details to confirm that we can support your business. The [Stripe Atlas Agreement](https://stripe.com/atlas/legal) and the [Stripe Privacy Policy](https://stripe.com/us/privacy) give more details about the information we collect and how we use that information.\n\n## After you sign your documents ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nAfter you sign your documents and submit the form, we review your information to make sure we have everything we need to form your company and to check that we can support your business within 1 business day. We might ask you clarifying questions or request additional details regarding your company. We’ll send you an email after you complete these steps. You can also track your approval progress in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/atlas).\n\n### Company formation ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nWe form your company after you submit the necessary information and we review it.\n\nRegistering your corporation in Delaware tends to take 1–2 business days. Your stock is issued after you’ve received your EIN and incorporation. If your company is a subsidiary of an existing company, Stripe Atlas provides templates that you can use with your lawyer.\n\n### Company documents ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nAfter Stripe forms your company, you can view your documents in the [Company](https://dashboard.stripe.com/atlas/company) page in the Dashboard. The available documents depend on whether you’re forming a [C Corporation](https://docs.stripe.com/atlas/company-types?business-type=ccorp) or an [LLC](https://docs.stripe.com/atlas/company-types?business-type=llc).\n\nIf you formed a C Corporation, we include the following documents:\n\n*   Certificate of Incorporation.\n*   Bylaws, for governing your corporation.\n*   Board Approval.\n*   IRS Form SS-4 (to request an EIN for tax-reporting purposes).\n*   IRS Form 8821 (to give us permission to call the IRS on your behalf).\n\n## How we get your tax ID (EIN) ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nAfter incorporation, we use your [Form SS-4](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fss4.pdf) to request an EIN for your company from the IRS. You also complete [Form 8821](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f8821.pdf), which allows us to call the IRS on your behalf to get your company’s EIN as fast as possible.\n\nIf you have a [Social Security number](https://www.ssa.gov/ssnumber/) (SSN) or [Individual Taxpayer Identification Number](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/individual-taxpayer-identification-number) (ITIN), Stripe Atlas can request an EIN on your company’s behalf through an online, expedited process that takes 1–2 business days. If you don’t have a SSN or ITIN, it generally takes 15–30 business days to receive your company’s EIN in your Dashboard and 6–8 weeks (or longer) to receive it by physical mail. After your company has its EIN, your company can activate Stripe payments, open a business banking account, and file US tax returns.\n\n#### Note\n\n## Registered agent service ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nDelaware requires that companies have a registered agent to receive official notices and maintain good standing. A registered agent is included as part of the initial 500 USD setup fee, and is renewed automatically each year thereafter for 100 USD. Your registered agent might contact you directly to share legal notices and communications from Delaware with you. Your registered agent address isn’t a general purpose mail-forwarding address for your company and shouldn’t be listed as a company address. You can separately use a virtual address service to receive general mail and for customer contact.",

    "url": "https://docs.stripe.com/test-mode",
    "markdown": "# Test mode and use cases\n\n## Use test mode and our uses cases to test your integration.\n\nStripe’s test mode allows you to test your integration without making actual charges or payments. Test mode is a testing environment that simulates creating real objects without the risk of affecting real transactions or moving actual money. We recommend using our quality assurance (QA) testing use cases, and importing our [Postman collection](https://www.getpostman.com/collections/080102f58f29afa081d7) to aid you in the testing process.\n\n## Test mode ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nIn test mode, you can charge test credit cards as well as create test products and prices. You can also use test mode to simulate transactions to make sure that your integration works correctly. This feature helps to identify any bugs or errors in your Stripe implementation before you go live with actual payments.\n\nAfter you create a Stripe account, you can find a set of [test API keys](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#obtain-api-keys) in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys). You can use these API keys to create and retrieve simulated data by making requests to the Stripe API. To start accepting real payments, you need to [activate your account](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/activate), toggle off test mode, and use the live API keys in your integration. Stripe provides a number of resources for testing your integration.\n\n#### Impact on live mode\n\nIn the Dashboard, changing settings in test mode might also change them in live mode. Many Dashboard pages have a white notification box and disable live mode settings while in test mode. In this case, any settings still enabled are safe to use. If there’s no white callout, assume any changes made in test mode affect live mode settings (unless you see an orange test data banner).\n\n### Test mode versus live mode ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nAll Stripe API requests occur in either test mode or live mode. API objects in one mode aren’t accessible to the other. For instance, a test-mode [product object](https://docs.stripe.com/api/products/object) can’t be part of a live-mode payment.\n\n| Type | When to use | Objects | How to use | Considerations |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| test mode | Use test mode, and its associated test API keys, as you build your integration. In test mode, card networks and payment providers don’t process payments. | API calls return simulated objects. For example, you can retrieve and use test `account`, `payment`, `customer`, `charge`, `refund`, `transfer`, `balance`, and `subscription` objects. | Use [test credit cards and accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/testing#cards). You can’t accept real payment methods or work with real accounts. | [Identity](https://docs.stripe.com/identity) doesn’t perform any verification checks. Also, Connect [account objects](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object) don’t return sensitive fields. |\n| live mode | Use live mode, and its associated live API keys, when you’re ready to launch your integration and accept real money. In live mode, card networks and payment providers do process payments. | API calls return real objects. For example, you can retrieve and use real `account`, `payment`, `customer`, `charge`, `refund`, `transfer`, `balance`, and `subscription` objects. | Accept real credit cards and work with customer accounts. You can accept actual payment authorizations, charges, and captures for credit cards and accounts. | Disputes have a more nuanced flow and a simpler [testing process](https://docs.stripe.com/testing#disputes). Also, some [payment methods](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods) have a more nuanced flow and require more steps. |\n\nThe **Test mode** toggle in the Dashboard doesn’t affect your integration code. Your test and live mode API keys affect the behavior of your code.\n\n### Test card numbers ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nStripe provides a set of [test card numbers](https://docs.stripe.com/testing#cards) that you can use to simulate various payment scenarios. You can use these test card numbers to create simulated payments in test mode without processing actual payments or charges.\n\nWhen you use test card numbers, you can enter any expiration date in the future and any three-digit CVC code to simulate a successful payment. If you want to simulate a failed payment, you can use specific test card numbers and CVC codes provided by Stripe.\n\nTest card numbers are only valid in test mode. Don’t use them for real payments.\n\n### Delete test data ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nTo delete all of your test data from your Stripe account, complete the following steps:\n\n1.  [Log in to the Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/) using your existing Stripe account.\n2.  While in test mode, click **Developers** and scroll down to the bottom of the **Overview** tab.\n3.  Click **Delete all test data…** The ensuing dialog gives you a list of all of your existing test data objects.\n4.  Click **Start deletion** to initiate the deletion process. You can’t undo the deletion of your test data.\n\nTest mode is temporarily unusable while the deletion process occurs.\n\n### Test email ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nBy default, Stripe won’t send an email to customers in test mode. If you want to verify emails for invoices and receipts, you can set the email address for your [Team](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/team) on the `Customer` object or `receipt_email` attribute on the PaymentIntent.\n\n## Testing use cases ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nThe following table contains quality assurance (QA) testing use cases:\n\n| **Use case** | **Action** |\n| --- | --- |\n| Charge success (capturing immediately) | *   No error.<br>*   The charge appears as **Succeeded** in the Dashboard under [Payments](https://dashboard.stripe.com/payments).<br>*   Stripe captures the charge. |\n| PaymentIntent authorization success ([capturing funds for later](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/place-a-hold-on-a-payment-method)) | `{   ...   \"capture_method\": \"manual\",   ...   \"status\": \"requires_capture\",   ... }` |\n| PaymentIntent capture success (capturing immediately or [capturing funds for later](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/place-a-hold-on-a-payment-method)) | `{     ...     \"status\": \"succeeded\",     ...   }` |\n| Charge fail | The charge appears as **Failed** in the Dashboard under [Payments](https://dashboard.stripe.com/payments).<br><br>`{   \"error\": {     \"charge\": \"ch_M8RkAWVyLbjkn1oJ\",     \"code\": \"card_declined\",     \"decline_code\": \"<<REASON HERE>>\",     \"doc_url\": \"[https://docs.stripe.com/error-codes#card-declined](https://docs.stripe.com/error-codes#card-declined)\",     \"message\": \"Your card was declined.\",     \"type\": \"card_error\"   } }` |\n| Radar block | No matter which version of Radar you use, it might block a charge due to [high risk](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/risk-evaluation#high-risk) or a [rule](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/rules). The response is the same as what you get when a charge fails. |\n| Charge disputed | *   The charge appears as **Disputed** in the Dashboard under [Payments](https://dashboard.stripe.com/payments).<br>*   Stripe debits the charge amount plus the dispute fee from the balance, creates a `Dispute` object along with its associated `charge.dispute.created` event.<br><br>`{   \"object\": {     \"id\": \"du_QfvJEU4Hzh79jwSJ\",     \"object\": \"dispute\",     \"charge_id\": \"ch_O1SJ4bOBs0dfxAHn\",     ...     \"status\": \"needs_response\"   } }` |\n| Charge inquiry opened | Inquiries are similar to disputes, with three key distinctions: no funds are withdrawn unless we elevate an inquiry to a dispute, they remain refundable until disputed, and have a different set of statuses.

To make integrating Stripe easier, we provide a [Payments-specific Postman collection](https://www.getpostman.com/collections/080102f58f29afa081d7) with the tools you need to test the server-side component of your integration.\n\n### Import the collection ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nTo begin, you need to access the Postman app. You can use either the browser or desktop version. After launching the app, import the collection.\n\nTo start this process on the web, press the **Import** button at the top-left corner, followed by the **Link** option. Insert the [Payments collection](https://www.getpostman.com/collections/080102f58f29afa081d7) link. If you’re using the Postman desktop app, click **File > Import**. After successfully importing, the collection appears under **Collections**.\n\n![The Import dialog](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/postman-import-modal.9cae305f4da63f7bd88cb89885c2e884.png)\n\nThe import dialog\n\n### Use the collection ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nTo use the collection, navigate to the collection you just imported and click **Variables**. Copy your testmode Stripe [secret key](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys) from the Stripe Dashboard, and paste it into the **Initial Value** field. After you complete this step, you’re ready to begin making requests.\n\nOther variables are populated by scripts during the runtime of the collection. For example, when creating a [customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/create), [price](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices/create), [charge](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/object) or [PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object), the system saves that ID through a script in the collection, which is then accessible for later requests, like issuing a refund.\n\n![The Variables Tab for the Collection](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/postman-variables-tab.791bd1b3fdb2d972387aa80b9e3555de.png)\n\nAdd a secret key to a Postman collection",

    "markdown": "# Use Boleto with invoices | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Learn how to use Boleto with invoices.\n\nLearn how to set up [Boleto](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/boleto) as a [payment method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods \"PaymentMethods\"). Boleto is a voucher with a generated number that [Customers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers \"Customers\") can obtain from an ATM, a bank, an online bank portal, or an authorized agency.\n\n[](#enable-boleto-emails)\n\nBefore you start your integration, go to **Manage payments that require confirmation** in your [Subscriptions and emails settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/automatic) and enable **Send a Stripe-hosted link for customers to confirm their payments when required**.\n\n[](#set-collection-method)\n\nYou can set the collection method in the Dashboard or [API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create#create_invoice-collection_method). For invoices, you can choose to either send an invoice or charge your customer automatically. If you’re using the API, the `send_invoice` and `charge_automatically` values determine the collection method.\n\n|     | Send invoice | Charge automatically |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| When to use | *   Your customer hasn’t defined their preferred payment method to pay invoices or subscriptions. In this case, you want to give them the option to use either a credit card or Boleto.<br>*   You’re missing important customer information required to use Boleto (full name, address, and tax ID). | *   Your customer already chose to pay for their invoices or subscriptions using boletos.<br>*   You have the customer information needed to create an invoice that uses Boleto (full name, address, and tax ID). |\n| Customer experience | *   Your customer needs to reenter their personal information details (full name, address, and tax ID) every time you send a new invoice, or for each new subscription cycle. This collection method doesn’t take into account the default payment method associated with that customer. | *   Your customer has Boleto set up as their default payment method. Your customer receives an email with a Boleto voucher every time you send them an invoice, or there’s a subscription cycle. |\n| Expiration and due dates | *   The invoice must contain a due date.<br>*   Stripe creates the boleto—regardless of the invoice due date—as soon as your customer enters the needed details. Because boletos have their own expiration date (the default is 3 days), the invoice due date and the boleto expiration date won’t necessarily match. The boleto might expire before or after the invoice is due. | *   The invoice doesn’t have a due date.<br>*   Stripe creates the boleto when the merchant creates the invoice with a selected expiration date (the default is 3 days). |\n\n[](#create-customers)\n\nCreate a customer for every new user or business you want to bill. When you create a new customer, set up a [minimal customer profile](#customer-profile) to help generate more useful invoices, and enable Smart Retries (if you’re an [Invoicing Plus](https://stripe.com/invoicing/pricing) user). After you set up your customer, you can issue one-off invoices or create [subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/creating \"subscriptions\").\n\n#### Caution\n\nBefore you create a new customer, make sure that the customer doesn’t already exist in the Dashboard. Creating multiple customer entries for the same customer can cause you problems later on, such as when you need to reconcile transaction history or coordinate saved payment methods.\n\nYou can create and manage customers on the [Customers page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/customers) when you don’t want to use code to create a customer, or if you want to manually bill a customer with a one-off invoice.\n\n#### Note\n\nYou can also create a customer in the Dashboard during invoice creation.\n\n### Create a customer ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nWhen you create a new customer, you can set their account and billing information, such as **Email**, **Name**, and **Country**. You can also set a customer’s preferred language, currency, and other important details.\n\nTo create a customer, complete these steps:\n\n1.  Verify that the customer doesn’t already exist.\n    \n2.  Click **Add customer**, or press **N**, on the **Customers** page.\n    \n3.  At a minimum, enter your customer’s **Name** and **Account email**.\n    \n4.  Click **Add customer** in the dialog.\n    \n\n### Edit a customer ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nTo edit a customer’s profile, complete these steps:\n\n1.  Find the customer you want to modify and click the name on the **Customers** page.\n    \n2.  In the account information page, select **Actions** > **Edit information**.\n    \n3.  Make your changes to the customer profile.\n    \n4.  Click **Update customer**.\n    \n\n### Delete a customer ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nTo delete a customer, complete these steps:\n\n1.  Find the customer you want to delete on the **Customers** page.\n    \n2.  Click the checkbox next to your customer’s name followed by **Delete**. You can also click into the customer’s details page and select **Actions** > **Delete customer**.\n    \n\n[](#create-product-price)\n\nDefine all your business and product offerings in one place. [Products](https://docs.stripe.com/api/products \"Products\") define what you sell and [Prices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices \"Prices\") track how much and how often to charge. This is a core entity within Stripe that works with [subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/creating \"subscriptions\"), [invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices \"invoices\"), and [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout).\n\nPrices enable these use cases:\n\n*   A software provider that charges a one-time setup fee whenever a user creates a new subscription.\n*   An e-commerce store that sends a recurring box of goods for 10 USD per month and wants to allow customers to purchase one-time add-ons.\n*   A professional services firm that can now create a standard list of services and choose from that list per invoice instead of typing out each line item by hand.\n*   A non-profit organization that allows donors to define a custom recurring donation amount per customer.\n\nYou can manage your product catalog with products and prices. Products define what you sell and prices track how much and how often to charge. Manage your products and their prices in the Dashboard or through the API.\n\nIf you used the Dashboard in test mode to set up your business, you can copy each of your products over to live mode by using **Copy to live mode** in the [Product catalog page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/products). Use our official libraries to access the Stripe API from your application.\n\n1.  Navigate to the **Product catalog** page, and click **Add product**.\n    \n2.  Select whether you want to create a **One-time product**, or a **Recurring one-time product**.\n    \n3.  Give your product a name, and assign it a price.\n    \n\n[](#create-invoice)\n\nTo create and send an invoice, complete these steps:\n\n1.  In the Dashboard, go to the [Invoices overview page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/invoices), then click **Create Invoice** to open the [invoice editor](https://dashboard.stripe.com/invoices/create). Whenever you exit the invoice editor, Stripe saves a draft. To delete a draft invoice, click the overflow menu () next to an invoice on the [Invoices page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/invoices).\n2.  Choose an existing customer by entering their name.\n3.  Select your product under **Items**, and enter the **Quantity**. Stripe automatically populates the product’s price based on what you selected when you first created the product.\n4.  Optional Click **Item options** if you need to add a tax rate, coupon, or supply date.\n    \n    #### Note\n    \n5.  Optional Use the **Memo** box to provide more information to your customer. You can edit the memo on an invoice by clicking **Edit memo** on its details page.\n6.  Select the following invoice delivery option, depending on whether you want to send the invoice or charge your customer automatically:\n    \n    #### Note\n    \n    If you want to automatically charge your customer using Boleto, navigate to the [Customers page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/customers), click on the customer, and select **Add Boleto** under Payment methods.\n    \n    *   **Automatically charge a payment method on file**—Immediately charges the invoice amount to the payment method that you have on file for the customer. (Select **Boleto** as the payment option.)\n        \n    *   **Email invoice with link**—Enables Stripe to send an email with a payment page and an invoice PDF. (Select **Boleto** and **card** as the payment options.)\n        \n7.  Optional Expand **Advanced options**, and add [custom fields](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/customize#custom-fields). You can also choose whether you want item prices to **Include inclusive tax** or **Exclude tax**. To learn more, see [Net prices and taxes](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/taxes#net-price-taxes). Expand **Advanced options**, and add [custom fields](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/customize#custom-fields).\n8.  Click **Review invoice** and decide whether you want to include additional emails or continue editing. Send the invoice.\n\nIf you automatically charge your customer, they still need to pay the Boleto for the payment to succeed (despite the finalization of the invoice.) Stripe sends your customer an email with a link that they can visit to complete their Boleto payment.\n\nCreate an invoice with the Dashboard",

Our banking partners determine supportability and might not be able to support all businesses. After you complete your company formation process, you can [activate your US Stripe payments account](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/activate) and add your bank account through the Dashboard.\n\n## Mercury ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nMercury works well for all startups. It lets startups open a 0 USD per month, FDIC-insured bank account from anywhere in the world. Mercury is best for high-growth tech startups. It offers startup-friendly features like free international USD wire transfers and access to venture debt, and allows customized banking options through the API. Atlas helps prefill fields for faster setup when you launch a Mercury application, and our users get 500 USD or more back when you deposit at least 10,000 USD within 60 days.\n\n#### Note\n\n### Set up a Mercury bank account ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nWhen you apply for a Mercury business bank account, Atlas uses your information to prefill as many of these required fields as possible:\n\n*   A description of your business and link to your website (if available).\n    \n*   Filed formation (incorporation) documents from the state of Delaware. You can access these through the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/atlas/company).\n    \n*   Articles of Incorporation and a record of an EIN filing with the IRS (Form CP575, Form 147c, filed or completed Form SS-4, or a screenshot of the EIN confirmation from the IRS’s website). You can access these documents through the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/atlas/company). Atlas passes them to Mercury automatically if you launch a Mercury application from the Dashboard.\n    \n*   An international passport or US government ID for each founder or majority owner (more than 25%) of the company.\n    \n*   A residential address (doesn’t have to be in the US) of each beneficial owner of the company.\n    \n*   An email address for each beneficial owner of the company.\n    \n*   A US Social Security number for each beneficial owner of the company (if applicable).\n    \n*   A phone number for each beneficial owner of the company.\n    \n\nAtlas users can open a Mercury account after incorporation, before the IRS issues their EIN. After your EIN arrives, you must submit it to Mercury no later than 90 days after account opening. They may close your account if you don’t submit within that window.\n\n## Novo ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nNovo works well for US-based small businesses, solo entrepreneurs, and bootstrapped startups.\n\nTrusted by over 200,000 businesses, Novo is a financial platform that offers fee-free, no minimum checking accounts.

    "markdown": "# Query Connect data | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Use Sigma and Data Pipeline to retrieve information about Connect.\n\n[Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect \"Connect\") platforms can report on their connected accounts using Sigma or Data Pipeline. You can write queries that run across your entire platform in much the same way as your own Stripe account.\n\nAdditional groups of Connect-specific tables within the schema are located in the **Connect** sections of the schema. If you don’t operate a Connect platform, these tables are not displayed.\n\n## Connected account information![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe `connected_accounts` table provides a list of [Account](https://docs.stripe.com/api#account_object) objects with information about connected accounts. This table is used for account-level information across all accounts on your platform, such as [business name](https://docs.stripe.com/api#account_object-business_name), [country](https://docs.stripe.com/api#account_object-country), or the user’s [email address](https://docs.stripe.com/api#account_object-email).\n\nThe following example uses the `connected_accounts` table to retrieve a list of five accounts for individuals located in the US that have [payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts \"payout\") disabled because Stripe does not have the [required verification information](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information) to [verify their account](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/identity-verification).\n\n`select     id,     email,     legal_entity_address_city as city,     legal_entity_address_line1 as line1,     legal_entity_address_postal_code as zip,     legal_entity_address_state as state,     legal_entity_dob_day as dob_day,     legal_entity_dob_month as dob_month,     legal_entity_dob_year as dob_year,`\n\nAll the required fields for individual accounts in the US are retrieved as columns. This allows you to see what information has been provided, and what is needed, for each account. This can be seen in the example report below (some columns have been omitted for brevity).\n\n| id  | email | city | …   | id\\_provided | document\\_id |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| acct\\_VIZ1jhN… | jenny.rosen@example.com | San Francisco | …   | true | file\\_SAcgarB… |\n| acct\\_SHfBJ6z… | sophia.garcia@example.com |     | …   | false | file\\_oNNWAxQ… |\n| acct\\_0pd6iEe… | natalie.davis@example.com | Seattle | …   | true | file\\_tjZLIML… |\n| acct\\_N1yvO0s… | ella.thompson@example.com | Austin | …   | false | file\\_dWUBRC6… |\n| acct\\_Rz0jyzJ… | james.smith@example.com |     | …   | false | file\\_AhmskXV… |\n\n## Accounts with requirements ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nThe `connected_accounts` table also contains information about the `requirements` and `future_requirements` for connected accounts. Use the table to retrieve lists of accounts that have requirements currently due and will be disabled soon. Use the `future_requirements` columns to [handle verification updates](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/handle-verification-updates).\n\nThe following example uses the `connected_accounts` table to retrieve a list of accounts that have upcoming verification updates.\n\n`select   id,   business_name,   requirements_currently_due,   future_requirements_currently_due from   connected_accounts where   future_requirements_currently_due != ''`\n\nThe `requirements_past_due`, `requirements_currently_due`, `requirements_eventually_due`, `future_requirements_past_due`, `future_requirements_currently_due`, and `future_requirements_eventually_due` are comma-separated lists of requirements on the account.\n\n| id  | business\\_name | requirements\\_currently\\_due | future\\_requirements\\_currently\\_due |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| acct\\_1I7mkwXysoc4TB0h | RocketRides |     | business\\_profile.url |\n| acct\\_1UmyxtrJMVIZxX65 | Kavholm |     | individual.email,settings.payments.statement\\_descriptor |\n| acct\\_1a0voJPvQLAI1J6k | FurEver | external\\_account | settings.payments.statement\\_descriptor |\n| acct\\_1MZxdFpGA2VPw4zU | Pasha | business\\_profile.url | company.tax\\_id |\n\n## Transactional data for connected accounts![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n[Transactional](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-data/query-transactions) and [subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-data/query-billing-data) data for connected accounts is contained within the `connected_account_` tables. The available data for connected accounts is organized and structured in the same way as data for your own account.\n\nFor instance, the `balance_transactions` table, located in the **Payments** section, contains balance transaction data for your Stripe account. The `connected_account_balance_transactions` table, located in the **Connect - Payments** section, contains balance transaction data for your connected accounts. Each Connect-specific table has an additional `account` column containing the identifier of a connected account. This can be used when joining tables to build advanced queries.\n\nThe following example is based upon the default query that’s loaded into the editor. Instead of retrieving the ten most recent balance transactions on your account, it does so across all of your platform’s connected accounts.\n\n`select       date_format(created, '%m-%d-%Y') as day,       account, -- Added to include corresponding account identifier       id,       amount,       currency,       source_id,       type     from connected_account_balance_transactions -- Changed to use Connect-specific table     order by day desc     limit 5`\n\n| day | account | id  | amount | currency | source\\_id | type |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 7/12/2024 | acct\\_Jl0y0Jv… | txn\\_UyD7poD… | \\-1,000 | usd | re\\_oAP7jIW… | refund |\n| 7/12/2024 | acct\\_U9EITUu… | txn\\_mE6uSkF… | 1,000 | usd | ch\\_GWozPuI… | charge |\n| 7/12/2024 | acct\\_fdoSuFG… | txn\\_bFQ37Nc… | 1,000 | usd | ch\\_xDRAy7Z… | charge |\n| 7/12/2024 | acct\\_n7o4OAX… | txn\\_x1ywNGk… | 1,000 | eur | ch\\_Y86tmJG… | charge |\n| 7/12/2024 | acct\\_BMrewXM… | txn\\_rKX37NB… | \\-1,000 | usd | re\\_OEAs0WP… | refund |\n\nRefer to our [transactions](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-data/query-transactions) and [subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-data/query-billing-data) documentation to learn more about querying transactional and subscription data. You can then supplement or adapt your queries with Connect-specific information to report on connected accounts.\n\n### Query charges on connected accounts![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nUse Sigma or Data Pipeline to report on the flow of funds to your connected accounts. How you do this depends on your platform’s approach to creating charges.\n\n## Direct charges![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nIf your platform creates [direct charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges) on a connected account, they appear on the connected account, not on your platform. This is analogous to a connected account making a charge request itself. Platforms can use the Connect-specific tables (for example, `connected_account_charges` or `connected_account_balance_transactions`) to report on direct charges.\n\nAccess the [direct charges query template](https://dashboard.stripe.com/sigma/queries/templates/Direct%20charges) to retrieve itemized information about application fees earned through direct charges, and reports on the connected account, transfer, and payment that is created.\n\n## Destination charges![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nIf your platform creates [destination charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges) on behalf of connected accounts, charge information is available within your own account’s data. A separate transfer of the funds to the connected account is automatically created, which creates a payment on that account. For example, the [destination charges query template](https://dashboard.stripe.com/sigma/queries/templates/Destination%20charges) reports on transfers related to destination charges made by your platform. One way to analyze the flow of funds from a destination charge to a connected account is by joining the `transfer_id` column of the `charges` table to the `id` column of the `transfers` table. This example includes the original charge identifier and amount, the amount transferred to the connected account, and the connected account’s identifiers and resulting payment.\n\n`select   date_format(date_trunc('day', charges.created), '%y-%m-%d') as day,   charges.id,   charges.amount as charge_amount,   transfers.amount as transferred_amount,   transfers.destination_id from charges inner join transfers   on transfers.id=charges.transfer_id order by day desc limit 5`\n\n| day | id  | charge\\_amount | transferred\\_amount | destination\\_id |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 7/12/2024 | ch\\_acct\\_0YrsWTU… | 1,000 | 1,000 | acct\\_cNn3Z6X… |\n| 7/12/2024 | ch\\_acct\\_Ed4l2oy… | 800 | 800 | acct\\_5jBPVaf… |\n| 7/12/2024 | ch\\_acct\\_AdXvTFH… | 1,000 | 800 | acct\\_dBiQJoz… |\n| 7/12/2024 | ch\\_acct\\_t2GqKo1… | 1,100 | 950 | acct\\_wMhn6KX… |\n| 7/12/2024 | ch\\_acct\\_ILHPJTR… | 1,100 | 1,100 | acct\\_eN8tSIG… |\n\nPayment and transfer information for Connected accounts is also available within Connect-specific tables (for example, `connected_account_charges`).\n\n### Separate charges and transfers![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nReport on [separate charges and transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers) using a similar approach to destination charges. All charges are created on your platform’s account, with funds separately transferred to connected accounts using [transfer groups](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers). A payment is created on the connected account that references the transfer and transfer group.\n\nBoth the `charges` and `transfers` table include a `transfer_group` column. Payment, transfer, and transfer group information is available within the Connect-specific `connected_account_charges` table.",

    "markdown": "# Business taxes | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Learn everything you need to know about business taxes.\n\nCompanies formed in Delaware are subject to yearly tax obligations, including:\n\n*   US federal and state corporate income tax as applicable.\n*   Delaware franchise tax (for C Corporations) or annual LLC tax (for Limited Liability Companies).\n*   A similar annual tax if your Delaware company also operates in other US states.\n\nStripe’s partners can assist you in meeting tax requirements for states outside Delaware. Make sure to watch the calendar, and plan ahead to meet any tax deadlines that apply to your business.\n\n#### Tax and accounting advice\n\nStripe isn’t an accounting firm and can’t provide tax or accounting advice. Consult legal and tax professionals for advice on how to meet ongoing obligations that apply to your company. Before you get started, you might want to review the Stripe Atlas guide on [business taxes](https://stripe.com/atlas/guides/business-taxes).\n\n## File US Income Tax ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nWhat information you need to prepare depends on whether you’re forming a [C Corporation](https://docs.stripe.com/atlas/company-types?business-type=ccorp) or [LLC](https://docs.stripe.com/atlas/company-types?business-type=llc). Before working with an accountant and filing taxes, prepare as much of your company’s year-end financial data as possible. This is part of your [bookkeeping](https://stripe.com/atlas/guides/bookkeeping-and-accounting#what-is-bookkeeping-what-is-accounting) responsibilities. You can use tools like [Bench](https://bench.co/partner/stripe-atlas/?utm_campaign=support) or [Pilot](https://pilot.com/) to help you with this process.\n\nBe sure to have the following information for your corporation (as of the last day of the fiscal year that you’re filing for):\n\n*   **General business information**: This includes your EIN.\n    \n*   **Company financials**: You can learn about year-end financial reports in our guide [tax season](https://stripe.com/atlas/guides/tax-season#before-you-speak-to-an-accountant). If you don’t have any revenue or expenses for the past fiscal year, you might still need to file taxes.\n    \n*   **Company ownership**: Your corporation might have shares held by individual shareholders or business entities. Make sure the information reflects the current ownership.\n    \n*   **Additional information**: If your company employs people, owns property, operates locally in the US, or operates abroad, you might have additional tax and reporting requirements. Some of the taxes you might want to ask about include:\n    \n    *   Transfer pricing (if you’re based outside the US).\n    *   State taxes (if you have business activity in any US state).\n    *   Sales taxes.\n    *   Employment taxes.\n\nIf you’re still waiting for your EIN, you can enter **Applied For** and the application date (which you can find on your Form SS-4 in the Dashboard) in your tax forms.\n\n## Tax partners ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nEach US business is required to pay income taxes. We’ve partnered with tax and accounting advisors who specialize in working with startups to provide you affordable options for filing your corporate income taxes. Top startups use these services and they offer discounts for Stripe Atlas users. Each service specializes in a different area—choose the one that’s right for your company.\n\n1.  [Legalinc](https://stripe.legalinc.com/annualreport/1?new=1) is best for Delaware franchise tax help if this is the only filing you want help with at this time (you’ll still need to file federal taxes for the 2023 tax year). They’ll pre-fill your Delaware franchise tax filing with you Atlas company information.\n2.  [Mosey](https://mosey.com/stripe-atlas/) is best for startups that want ongoing help with registration and compliance filings in multiple states (including the Delaware franchise tax) without federal tax prep or bookkeeping.\n3.  [Bench](https://bench.co/partner/stripe-atlas/?utm_campaign=support) is best for pre-revenue startups or small startups who want recurring tax or bookkeeping services for state and federal taxes.\n4.  [Pilot](https://pilot.com/partner/atlas?utm_medium=web&utm_source=partner&utm_campaign=atlas_referrals) is best for startups planning to raise funding, who want recurring tax and bookkeeping services for state and federal taxes.\n5.  [Cleer](https://www.cleer.tax/partner/atlas) is best for startups that want one-time assistance with federal and state tax prep.\n\n## File taxes in Delaware ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nYour company’s tax and reporting obligations in Delaware depend on whether you’re forming a [C Corporation](https://docs.stripe.com/atlas/company-types?business-type=ccorp) or an [LLC](https://docs.stripe.com/atlas/company-types?business-type=llc).\n\nAll Delaware C Corporations are required to pay the Delaware franchise tax and to file an annual report, which you can [pay online](https://corp.delaware.gov/paytaxes/) if you want to complete it yourself. Even companies with no revenue in the previous fiscal year should expect to pay some amount. If you want to hire a tax professional to complete this, you can work with one of our [tax partners](https://docs.stripe.com/atlas/business-taxes#tax-partners) or a tax advisor of your own choosing.\n\n### Delaware franchise tax ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nYou have the option to recalculate your taxes due on the Delaware website. Follow the steps below. Delaware sends notices using a calculation method that results in large tax bills for companies with more than 5,000 shares. Most Atlas companies find they pay less tax when they use the [Assumed Par Value Capital](https://corp.delaware.gov/frtaxcalc/) method instead of the default Authorized Shares method. You can read about [these methods](https://corp.delaware.gov/frtaxcalc.shtml) on Delaware’s website. If the franchise tax isn’t submitted by March 1, there is a 200 USD late fee and interest of 1.5% per month on the tax amount originally due.\n\n#### Pay Delaware franchise tax ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nComplete the following steps to pay your Delaware franchise tax. You can save your work and return to it later, just make sure to save your session number, which the Delaware portal gives you the option of sending to an email address for easier access.\n\n1.  Login to [the state of Delaware’s website](https://icis.corp.delaware.gov/ecorp/logintax.aspx?FilingType=FranchiseTax) with your seven digit Delaware Business Entity File Number.\n    *   You can easily find your company’s file number in two ways:\n        1.  Use [Delaware’s entity search tool](https://icis.corp.delaware.gov/ecorp/EntitySearch/NameSearch.aspx) with your company’s legal name.\n        2.  Find the State of Delaware stamp on the second page of your **Filed Certificate of Incorporation**. You can find this in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/atlas/company).\n2.  Click on the **File annual report** link.\n3.  Enter your company information:\n    *   Complete the **Stock information** section to adjust your taxes owed shown in the upper right corner: enter the number of shares your company has issued, your gross assets (your **Total assets** on your corporate income tax return), and your **Asset date** (the same as your end of fiscal year). Then click the **Recalculate tax** button (can take some time to reload).\n    *   Complete all of the remaining required fields indicated with a red star.\n    *   If you haven’t adjusted your list of officers or directors since you incorporated, you can find these individuals in your **Board Approval** document in your [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/atlas/company).\n4.  When all required information is complete, press the green **Continue filing** button to review your information for accuracy.\n5.  After you verify you entered all of the correct information, press the green **Proceed to payment** button.\n    *   You pay Delaware franchise tax and annual report filing fee either by credit card or ACH. After inputting your payment information, push the green **submit** button to finalize your Delaware state taxes.\n\n## State taxes beyond Delaware ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nIf your company operates in any US states other than Delaware, it might be subject to annual taxation, registration, and reporting requirements in the other states. Stripe recommends that you consult legal and tax professionals about what requirements apply to your business.\n\n## 2024 key tax season dates ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nPlan ahead to meet any tax deadlines that apply to your business. Refer to the following information if your company was active in 2023.\n\n*   March 1, 2024: [Delaware franchise tax](https://docs.stripe.com/atlas/business-taxes#file-delaware-tax) due (penalty for late payments: 200 USD fee and interest of 1.5% per month on the tax amount originally due).\n*   April 15, 2024: [US federal corporate income tax](https://docs.stripe.com/atlas/business-taxes?business-type=llc#file-us-corp-tax) due date.\n*   October 15, 2024: If you filed for an extension, this is the due date for filing [US corporate income taxes](https://docs.stripe.com/atlas/business-taxes#file-us-corp-tax).\n\nAlso, if your US company has employees or makes payments to US vendors, you might be required to file a US W-2 or 1099 form by January 31, 2024.\n\n### Dissolve your company ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nIf you aren’t operating your company anymore, you might still be obligated to file taxes every year until you dissolve it. When you dissolve a company, you might have tax filings and obligations for the year that you dissolve the company. You can work with our tax partners to figure out what your obligations are.\n\nC Corporations can be dissolved in the state of Delaware only after they pay Delaware franchise tax and file their annual report. LLCs can be dissolved only after they pay annual LLC tax (no annual report is required).\n\nYou can start the process of dissolving your company from the [Company tab](https://dashboard.stripe.com/atlas/company) of your Atlas Dashboard. You should consider working with a lawyer to ensure full dissolution of your company.\n\n## See also![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n*   [Tax season guide](https://stripe.com/atlas/guides/tax-season)\n*   [Business taxes guide](https://stripe.com/atlas/guides/business-taxes)\n*   [Bookkeeping and accounting guide](https://stripe.com/guides/atlas/bookkeeping-and-accounting)\n*   [State of Delaware’s tax FAQ](https://corp.delaware.gov/taxfaq/)",

Using Sigma queries allows you to gain insights about your customers and payments across your entire business in the Dashboard.\n\n## Getting started ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nBefore you begin, complete the following steps:\n\n1.  [Create an organization](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/orgs/build) and add all the accounts you want to include in your queries.\n2.  Enable Sigma in each account you want to include in your queries.\n3.  Make sure that you’re assigned a role at the organization-level with permissions to view reports (such as [Analyst](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/teams/roles)) to run and execute Sigma queries.\n\n## Run Sigma queries across multiple accounts![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nTo run Sigma queries that span multiple accounts in your organization, follow these steps:\n\n1.  From the Dashboard, switch into your organization from the account picker, then click [**Sigma**](https://dashboard.stripe.com/org/sigma/queries).\n2.  Write a new query, choose from saved queries, or select from the list of templates.\n3.  To specify the accounts in scope of your query, click the **Run on accounts** dropdown in the top right corner, then click **Edit business accounts**.\n4.  Run the query across the accounts you selected.\n\n### Return results for each account![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nBy default, queries return results that include data across all selected accounts. To return results for each account, you can group results by `merchant_id`. For example, the following query returns the sum of payment intents in the last 14 days for each account and currency:\n\n`select   merchant_id,   currency,   sum(amount) as total_payment_volume_last_14d from payment_intents where created >= date_add('day', -14, current_date) group by 1, 2`\n\n| `merchant_id` | `currency` | `total_payment_volume_last_14d` |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| acct\\_9N1RzRetYxbPISC | USD | 4934823 |\n| acct\\_gNe6FJafga1XLFg | CAD | 2235991 |\n| acct\\_2IE7oQNrZH2v55C | GBP | 1870021 |\n| acct\\_VOK3PNgEzg4FrcJ | EU  | 9008212 |\n\n### Filter accounts within a query![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nTo use the `merchant_id` field to filter results to specific accounts directly in your query, add a `WHERE merchant_id = 'acct_id'` clause. For example, the following query returns the total volume of payments in a specific account:\n\n`select   currency,   sum(amount) as total_payment_volume_last_14d from payment_intents where created >= date_add('day', -14, current_date) AND merchant_id in (   'acct_d8upQPPBbFtSIe1',   'acct_1fCSEPk3waoDZox' ) group by 1`\n\n| `currency` | `total_payment_volume_last_14d` |\n| --- | --- |\n| USD | 8833809 |\n| CAD | 9008212 |",

    "markdown": "# Troubleshoot signature verification errors | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Learn how to fix a common error when listening to webhook events.\n\nWhen processing webhook events, we recommend securing your endpoint by [verifying](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks#verify-official-libraries) that the event is coming from Stripe. You can verify this by using the `Stripe-Signature` header and calling the `constructEvent()` function with three parameters:\n\n*   `requestBody`: the request body string sent by Stripe\n*   `signature`: the Stripe-Signature header in the request sent by Stripe\n*   `endpointSecret`: the secret associated with your endpoint\n\n`Stripe::Webhook.construct_event(request_body, signature, endpoint_secret)`\n\nWhen calling this function, you might get a signature verification error.\n\n`Webhook signature verification failed. Err: No signatures found matching the expected signature for payload.`\n\nIf you get this error, at least one of the three parameters you passed to the above function is incorrect. The following steps explain how to verify that each parameter is correctly set.\n\n## Check the endpoint secret![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe most common error is using the wrong endpoint secret, so it’s important to confirm that it’s correct.\n\nIf you’re using a webhook endpoint created in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/webhooks), open the endpoint in the Dashboard and click the **Reveal secret** link near the top of the page to view the secret.\n\n![Dashboard screenshot showing where to find the webhook secret key](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/dashboard-secret.ea91fb644ee376b25daee8438bc6a33c.png)\n\nIf you’re using the Stripe CLI, the secret is printed in the Terminal when you run the `stripe listen` command.\n\n![cli screenshot showing where to find the webhook secret key](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/cli-secret.43855dd95672a6d396ef8cf2eeb9e8fa.png)\n\nIn both cases, the secret starts with a `whsec_` prefix, but the secret itself is different. Don’t verify signatures on events forwarded by the CLI using the secret from a Dashboard-managed endpoint, or the other way around.\n\nFinally, print the `endpointSecret` used in your code, and make sure that it matches the one you found above.\n\n## Check the request body![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe request body must be the body string sent by Stripe in UTF-8 encoding without any changes. When you print it as a string it should look something like this.\n\n`{   \"id\": \"evt_xxx\",   \"object\": \"event\",   \"data\": {       ...   } }`\n\nSome frameworks try to be helpful and change the request body by doing things like adding or removing whitespace, reordering the key-value pairs, converting the string to JSON, or changing the encoding. All of these cases lead to a failed signature verification.\n\nThe following is a non-exhaustive list of frameworks that might parse or mutate the data using common configurations, and some tips on how to get the raw request body.\n\n### The stripe-node library with Express![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nFollow our [integration quickstart guide](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks/quickstart?lang=node).\n\n### The stripe-node library with Body Parser![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nTry the various solutions listed in [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-node/issues/341).\n\n### The stripe-node library using Next.js endpoints![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nTry disabling `bodyParser` and using `buffer(request)` as shown in [this example](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-node/blob/master/examples/webhook-signing/nextjs/pages/api/webhooks.ts) on GitHub.\n\n### The AWS API Gateway with Lambda function![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nFirst, in the API Gateway, set up a Body Mapping Template like this:\n\n*   Content-Type: `application/json`\n*   Template contents:\n\n`{   \"method\": \"$context.httpMethod\",   \"body\": $input.json('$'),   \"rawBody\": \"$util.escapeJavaScript($input.body).replaceAll(\"\\\\'\", \"'\")\",   \"headers\": {     #foreach($param in $input.params().header.keySet())     \"$param\": \"$util.escapeJavaScript($input.params().header.get($param))\"     #if($foreach.hasNext),#end     #end   } }`\n\nThen, in the Lambda function, access the raw body with the event’s `rawBody` property and the headers with the event’s `headers` property.\n\n## Check the signature![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nPrint the `signature` parameter, and confirm that it looks something like this.\n\nIf not, there’s probably an issue in your code when trying to extract the signature from the header.",

    "markdown": "# Handle webhook versioning | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Learn how to upgrade the API version of your webhook endpoint.\n\nWebhook endpoints either have a specific API version set, or use the default API version of the Stripe account. To upgrade to a newer API version with no downtime, follow the steps below in test mode and then in live mode.\n\n## Create a new disabled webhook endpoint![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nCreate a new webhook endpoint with the following parameters:\n\n*   `url`: the same URL as your original webhook endpoint, but add a query parameter to distinguish between events sent to the two different endpoints. For example `https://example.com/webhooks?version=2024-04-10`.\n*   `enabled_events`: the same events as your original webhook endpoint.\n*   `api_version`: the API version you want to upgrade to. If you’re upgrading to the latest API version, you can use the Dashboard or the API to create the endpoint. For other versions, use the API to set a specific version.\n\nAfter you create the new webhook endpoint, disable it. You will re-enable it in the next step.\n\n![Two endpoints, but only the old one is sending events](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/diagram-1.ac21ab637180179813f503649b543e99.png)\n\n## Update your webhook code to ignore events sent to the new endpoint![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nUpdate your event processing code:\n\n*   If the query parameter is for the older API version, process it as usual.\n*   If the query parameter is for the newer API version, ignore the event and return a 200 response to prevent delivery retries.\n\nNext, enable the new webhook endpoint that you created in the previous step. At this point every event is sent twice: once with the old API version and once with the new one.\n\n![Two endpoints sending events, but only processing the old one](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/diagram-2.f6b4d3cc0c78971b721fe173f19d5e28.png)\n\n## Update your webhook code to process events for the new endpoint![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nUpdate the version of the Stripe library you’re using to match the version of your new webhook endpoint. Make sure to read the changelog and handle any breaking changes.\n\nUpdate your event processing code:\n\n*   If the query parameter is for the older version, ignore the event. We recommend returning a 400 status to let Stripe automatically retry the event. This ensures that if you need to revert, events are re-sent to the older webhook endpoint.\n*   If the query parameter is for the new version, process it.\n\n![Two endpoints sending events, but only processing the new one](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/diagram-3.8a8b9da70ed66eca60434d406c82f476.png)\n\n## Monitor your new webhook endpoint![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nIf events aren’t being correctly handled by your new code, try the following:\n\n1.  Revert to the earlier version of your code.\n2.  Temporarily disable the new webhook endpoint.\n3.  Process the failed events (if you returned a 400 status as described in the previous step, Stripe automatically resends all the events).\n4.  Investigate and fix the issue.\n5.  Enable the new webhook endpoint and resume monitoring.\n\n## Disable the old webhook endpoint![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nIf the upgrade is successful, you can disable the old webhook endpoint.

Coupon creation is also accessible via the API if you need to create coupons on the fly.\n\nA coupon has either a `percent_off` or an `amount_off` and `currency`. If you set an `amount_off`, that amount will be subtracted from any invoice’s subtotal. For example, an invoice with a subtotal of 100 USD will have a final total of 0 USD if a coupon with an `amount_off` of 20000 is applied to it and an invoice with a subtotal of 300 USD will have a final total of 100 USD if a coupon with an `amount_off` of 20000 is applied to it.\n\n### Parameters\n\n*   A positive integer representing the amount to subtract from an invoice total (required if `percent_off` is not passed).\n    \n*   Three-letter [ISO code for the currency](https://stripe.com/docs/currencies) of the `amount_off` parameter (required if `amount_off` is passed).\n    \n*   Specifies how long the discount will be in effect if used on a subscription. Defaults to `once`.\n    \n    Possible enum values\n    \n    |     |\n    | --- |\n    | `forever`<br><br>Applies to all charges from a subscription with this coupon applied. |\n    | `once`<br><br>Applies to the first charge from a subscription with this coupon applied. |\n    | `repeating`<br><br>Applies to charges in the first `duration_in_months` months from a subscription with this coupon applied. |\n    \n*   #### \n    \n    duration\\_in\\_monthsinteger\n    \n    Required only if `duration` is `repeating`, in which case it must be a positive integer that specifies the number of months the discount will be in effect.\n    \n*   Set of [key-value pairs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/metadata) that you can attach to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format. Individual keys can be unset by posting an empty value to them. All keys can be unset by posting an empty value to `metadata`.\n    \n*   Name of the coupon displayed to customers on, for instance invoices, or receipts. By default the `id` is shown if `name` is not set.\n    \n*   A positive float larger than 0, and smaller or equal to 100, that represents the discount the coupon will apply (required if `amount_off` is not passed).\n    \n\n### More parameters\n\n### Returns\n\nReturns the coupon object.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/coupons \\  -u \"sk_test_4eC39Hq...arjtT1zdp7dcsk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc:\" \\  -d duration=repeating \\  -d duration_in_months=3 \\  -d percent_off=\"25.5\"\n```\n\n```\n{  \"id\": \"jMT0WJUD\",  \"object\": \"coupon\",  \"amount_off\": null,  \"created\": 1678037688,  \"currency\": null,  \"duration\": \"repeating\",  \"duration_in_months\": 3,  \"livemode\": false,  \"max_redemptions\": null,  \"metadata\": {},  \"name\": null,  \"percent_off\": 25.5,  \"redeem_by\": null,  \"times_redeemed\": 0,  \"valid\": true}\n```\n\n## [Update a coupon](https://docs.stripe.com/api/coupons/update)\n\nUpdates the metadata of a coupon.

identifiable information (PII), directly from your customers in a secure manner. A token representing this information is returned to your server to use. Use our [recommended payments integrations](https://docs.stripe.com/payments) to perform this process on the client-side. This guarantees that no sensitive card data touches your server, and allows your integration to operate in a PCI-compliant way.\n\nIf you can’t use client-side tokenization, you can also create tokens using the API with either your publishable or secret API key. If your integration uses this method, you’re responsible for any PCI compliance that it might require, and you must keep your secret API key safe. Unlike with client-side tokenization, your customer’s information isn’t sent directly to Stripe, so we can’t determine how it’s handled or stored.\n\nYou can’t store or use tokens more than once. To store card or bank account information for later use, create [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api#customers) objects or [External accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/api#external_accounts). [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar), our integrated solution for automatic fraud protection, performs best with integrations that use client-side tokenization.\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_account)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_bank_account)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_card)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_cvc_update)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_person)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_pii)[GET/v1/tokens/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/retrieve)\n\n## [Cash Balance](https://docs.stripe.com/api/cash_balance)\n\nA customer’s `Cash balance` represents real funds. Customers can add funds to their cash balance by sending a bank transfer. These funds can be used for payment and can eventually be paid out to your bank account.\n\n## [Customer Portal Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customer_portal/sessions)\n\nThe Billing customer portal is a Stripe-hosted UI for subscription and billing management.\n\nA portal configuration describes the functionality and features that you want to provide to your customers through the portal.\n\nA portal session describes the instantiation of the customer portal for a particular customer. By visiting the session’s URL, the customer can manage their subscriptions and billing details. For security reasons, sessions are short-lived and will expire if the customer does not visit the URL. Create sessions on-demand when customers intend to manage their subscriptions and billing details.\n\nRelated guide: [Customer management](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management)\n\n## [Invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices)\n\nInvoices are statements of amounts owed by a customer, and are either generated one-off, or generated periodically from a subscription.\n\nThey contain [invoice items](#invoiceitems), and proration adjustments that may be caused by subscription upgrades/downgrades (if necessary).\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed through automatic charges, Stripe automatically finalizes your invoice and attempts payment. Note that finalizing the invoice, [when automatic](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/automatic-advancement-collection), does not happen immediately as the invoice is created. Stripe waits until one hour after the last webhook was successfully sent (or the last webhook timed out after failing). If you (and the platforms you may have connected to) have no webhooks configured, Stripe waits one hour after creation to finalize the invoice.\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed by sending an email, then based on your [email settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/billing/automatic), Stripe will email the invoice to your customer and await payment. These emails can contain a link to a hosted page to pay the invoice.\n\nStripe applies any customer credit on the account before determining the amount due for the invoice (i.e., the amount that will be actually charged). If the amount due for the invoice is less than Stripe’s [minimum allowed charge per currency](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts), the invoice is automatically marked paid, and we add the amount due to the customer’s credit balance which is applied to the next invoice.\n\nMore details on the customer’s credit balance are [here](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/customer/balance).\n\nRelated guide: [Send invoices to customers](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/invoices/sending)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create)[POST/v1/invoices/create\\_preview](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create_preview)[POST/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/lines/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_line)[GET/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/retrieve)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming)[GET/v1/invoices/:id/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming_invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/list)[DELETE/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/delete)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/add\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/add_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/remove\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/remove_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/update\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/finalize](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/finalize)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/mark\\_uncollectible](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/mark_uncollectible)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/pay](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/pay)[GET/v1/invoices/search](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/search)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/send](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/send)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/void](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/void)\n\n## [Meter Events](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event)\n\nA billing meter event represents a customer’s usage of a product. Meter events are used to bill a customer based on their usage. Meter events are associated with billing meters, which define the shape of the event’s payload and how those events are aggregated for billing.\n\n## [Meter Event Adjustment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_adjustment)\n\nA billing meter event adjustment is a resource that allows you to cancel a meter event. For example, you might create a billing meter event adjustment to cancel a meter event that was created in error or attached to the wrong customer.\n\n## [Meter Event Summary](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_summary)\n\nA billing meter event summary represents an aggregated view of a customer’s billing meter events within a specified timeframe. It indicates how much usage was accrued by a customer for that period.\n\n## [Plans](https://docs.stripe.com/api/plans)\n\nYou can now model subscriptions more flexibly using the [Prices API](#prices). It replaces the Plans API and is backwards compatible to simplify your migration.\n\nPlans define the base price, currency, and billing cycle for recurring purchases of products. [Products](#products) help you track inventory or provisioning, and plans help you track pricing. Different physical goods or levels of service should be represented by products, and pricing options should be represented by plans. This approach lets you change prices without having to change your provisioning scheme.\n\nFor example, you might have a single “gold” product that has plans for $10/month, $100/year, €9/month, and €90/year.\n\nRelated guides: [Set up a subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/set-up-subscription) and more about [products and prices](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/overview).\n\n## [Tax IDs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_create)[POST/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/create)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_retrieve)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/retrieve)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_list)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/list)[DELETE/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_delete)[DELETE/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/delete)\n\n## [Account Links](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_links)\n\nAccount Links are the means by which a Connect platform grants a connected account permission to access Stripe-hosted applications, such as Connect Onboarding.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect Onboarding](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom/hosted-onboarding)\n\n## [Account Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_sessions)\n\nAn AccountSession allows a Connect platform to grant access to a connected account in Connect embedded components.\n\nWe recommend that you create an AccountSession each time you need to display an embedded component to your user. Do not save AccountSessions to your database as they expire relatively quickly, and cannot be used more than once.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect embedded components](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-connect-embedded-components)\n\n## [Application Fees](https://docs.stripe.com/api/application_fees)\n\nWhen you collect a transaction fee on top of a charge made for your user (using [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)), an `Application Fee` object is created in your account. You can list, retrieve, and refund application fees.\n\nRelated guide: [Collecting application fees](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges#collect-fees)\n\n## [Country Specs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/country_specs)\n\nStripe needs to collect certain pieces of information about each account created. These requirements can differ depending on the account’s country. The Country Specs API makes these rules available to your integration.\n\nYou can also view the information from this API call as [an online guide](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information).\n\n## [Person](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/create)[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/update)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/retrieve)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/list)[DELETE/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/delete)\n\n## [Transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/transfers)\n\nA `Transfer` object is created when you move funds between Stripe accounts as part of Connect.\n\nBefore April 6, 2017, transfers also represented movement of funds from a Stripe account to a card or bank account. This behavior has since been split out into a [Payout](#payout_object) object, with corresponding payout endpoints. For more information, read about the [transfer/payout split](https://docs.stripe.com/transfer-payout-split).\n\nRelated guide: [Creating separate charges and transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n\n## [Secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/secret_management)\n\nSecret Store is an API that allows Stripe Apps developers to securely persist secrets for use by UI Extensions and app backends.\n\nThe primary resource in Secret Store is a `secret`. Other apps can’t view secrets created by an app. Additionally, secrets are scoped to provide further permission control.\n\nAll Dashboard users and the app backend share `account` scoped secrets. Use the `account` scope for secrets that don’t change per-user, like a third-party API key.\n\nA `user` scoped secret is accessible by the app backend and one specific Dashboard user. Use the `user` scope for per-user secrets like per-user OAuth tokens, where different users might have different permissions.\n\nRelated guide: [Store data between page reloads](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/store-auth-data-custom-objects)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[GET/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/list)[POST/v1/apps/secrets/delete](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/delete)[GET/v1/apps/secrets/find](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/find)[POST/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/set)\n\n## [Reviews](https://docs.stripe.com/api/radar/reviews)\n\nReviews can be used to supplement automated fraud detection with human expertise.\n\nLearn more about [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar) and reviewing payments [here](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/reviews).\n\n## [Authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/update)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/list)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/approve](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/approve)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/decline](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/decline)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_create)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/capture](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_capture)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/expire](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_expire)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/finalize\\_amount](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_finalize_amount)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/increment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_increment)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/fraud\\_challenges/respond](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/respond_to_fraud_challenges)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/reverse](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_reverse)\n\n## [Cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/create)[POST/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/update)[GET/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/list)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/deliver](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_deliver)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/fail](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_fail)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/return](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_return)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/ship](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_ship)\n\n## [Physical Bundles](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/physical_bundles)\n\nA Physical Bundle represents the bundle of physical items - card stock, carrier letter, and envelope - that is shipped to a cardholder when you create a physical card.\n\n## [Reader](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/terminal/readers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/create)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/update)[GET/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/retrieve)[GET/v1/terminal/readers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/list)[DELETE/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/delete)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/cancel\\_action](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/cancel_action)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/collect\\_inputs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/collect_inputs)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/confirm\\_payment\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/confirm_payment_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/collect\\_payment\\_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/collect_payment_method)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/process\\_payment\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/process_payment_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/process\\_setup\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/process_setup_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/refund\\_payment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/refund_payment)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/set\\_reader\\_display](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/set_reader_display)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/terminal/readers/:id/present\\_payment\\_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/present_payment_method)\n\n## [Terminal Hardware Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_products)Preview feature\n\nA TerminalHardwareProduct is a category of hardware devices that are generally similar, but may have variations depending on the country it’s shipped to.\n\nTerminalHardwareSKUs represent variations within the same Product (for example, a country specific device). For example, WisePOS E is a TerminalHardwareProduct and a WisePOS E - US and WisePOS E - UK are TerminalHardwareSKUs.\n\n## [Terminal Hardware SKU](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_skus)Preview feature\n\nA TerminalHardwareSKU represents a SKU for Terminal hardware. A SKU is a representation of a product available for purchase, containing information such as the name, price, and images.\n\n## [Transaction Entries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/transaction_entries)\n\nTransactionEntries represent individual units of money movements within a single [Transaction](#transactions).\n\n## [Scheduled Queries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/sigma/scheduled_queries)\n\nIf you have [scheduled a Sigma query](https://docs.stripe.com/sigma/scheduled-queries), you’ll receive a `sigma.scheduled_query_run.created` webhook each time the query runs. The webhook contains a `ScheduledQueryRun` object, which you can use to retrieve the query results.\n\n## [Report Types](https://docs.stripe.com/api/reporting/report_type)\n\nThe Report Type resource corresponds to a particular type of report, such as the “Activity summary” or “Itemized payouts” reports. These objects are identified by an ID belonging to a set of enumerated values. See [API Access to Reports documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/reporting/statements/api) for those Report Type IDs, along with required and optional parameters.\n\nNote that certain report types can only be run based on your live-mode data (not test-mode data), and will error when queried without a [live-mode API key](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#test-live-modes).\n\n## [Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/financial_connections/sessions)\n\nA Financial Connections Session is the secure way to programmatically launch the client-side Stripe.js modal that lets your users link their accounts.\n\n## [Verification Report](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_reports)\n\nA VerificationReport is the result of an attempt to collect and verify data from a user. The collection of verification checks performed is determined from the `type` and `options` parameters used. You can find the result of each verification check performed in the appropriate sub-resource: `document`, `id_number`, `selfie`.\n\nEach VerificationReport contains a copy of any data collected by the user as well as reference IDs which can be used to access collected images through the [FileUpload](https://docs.stripe.com/api/files) API. To configure and create VerificationReports, use the [VerificationSession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_sessions) API.\n\nRelated guide: [Accessing verification results](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verification-sessions#results).\n\n## [Crypto Onramp Quotes](https://docs.stripe.com/api/crypto/onramp_quotes)\n\nCrypto Onramp Quotes are estimated quotes for onramp conversions into all the different cryptocurrencies on different networks. The Quotes API allows you to display quotes in your product UI before directing the user to the onramp widget.\n\nRelated guide: [Quotes API](https://docs.stripe.com/crypto/quotes-api)\n\n## [Climate Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/climate/product)\n\nA Climate product represents a type of carbon removal unit available for reservation. You can retrieve it to see the current price and availability.\n\n## [Forwarding Request](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/request)\n\nInstructs Stripe to make a request on your behalf using the destination URL. The destination URL is activated by Stripe at the time of onboarding. Stripe verifies requests with your credentials provided during onboarding, and injects card details from the payment\\_method into the request.\n\nStripe redacts all sensitive fields and headers, including authentication credentials and card numbers, before storing the request and response data in the forwarding Request object, which are subject to a 30-day retention period.\n\nYou can provide a Stripe idempotency key to make sure that requests with the same key result in only one outbound request. The Stripe idempotency key provided should be unique and different from any idempotency keys provided on the underlying third-party request.\n\nForwarding Requests are synchronous requests that return a response or time out according to Stripe’s limits.\n\nRelated guide: [Forward card details to third-party API endpoints](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/forwarding).\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/create)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/retrieve)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/list)",

If the confirmation is successful, values present on the ConfirmationToken are written onto the Intent.\n\nTo learn more about how to use ConfirmationToken, visit the related guides:\n\n*   [Finalize payments on the server](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/finalize-payments-on-the-server)\n*   [Build two-step confirmation](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/build-a-two-step-confirmation).\n\n## [Tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens)\n\nTokenization is the process Stripe uses to collect sensitive card or bank account details, or personally identifiable information (PII), directly from your customers in a secure manner. A token representing this information is returned to your server to use. Use our [recommended payments integrations](https://docs.stripe.com/payments) to perform this process on the client-side. This guarantees that no sensitive card data touches your server, and allows your integration to operate in a PCI-compliant way.\n\nIf you can’t use client-side tokenization, you can also create tokens using the API with either your publishable or secret API key. If your integration uses this method, you’re responsible for any PCI compliance that it might require, and you must keep your secret API key safe. Unlike with client-side tokenization, your customer’s information isn’t sent directly to Stripe, so we can’t determine how it’s handled or stored.\n\nYou can’t store or use tokens more than once. To store card or bank account information for later use, create [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api#customers) objects or [External accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/api#external_accounts). [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar), our integrated solution for automatic fraud protection, performs best with integrations that use client-side tokenization.\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_account)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_bank_account)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_card)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_cvc_update)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_person)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_pii)[GET/v1/tokens/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/retrieve)\n\n## [Cash Balance](https://docs.stripe.com/api/cash_balance)\n\nA customer’s `Cash balance` represents real funds. Customers can add funds to their cash balance by sending a bank transfer. These funds can be used for payment and can eventually be paid out to your bank account.\n\n## [Customer Portal Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customer_portal/sessions)\n\nThe Billing customer portal is a Stripe-hosted UI for subscription and billing management.\n\nA portal configuration describes the functionality and features that you want to provide to your customers through the portal.\n\nA portal session describes the instantiation of the customer portal for a particular customer. By visiting the session’s URL, the customer can manage their subscriptions and billing details. For security reasons, sessions are short-lived and will expire if the customer does not visit the URL. Create sessions on-demand when customers intend to manage their subscriptions and billing details.\n\nRelated guide: [Customer management](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management)\n\n## [Invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices)\n\nInvoices are statements of amounts owed by a customer, and are either generated one-off, or generated periodically from a subscription.\n\nThey contain [invoice items](#invoiceitems), and proration adjustments that may be caused by subscription upgrades/downgrades (if necessary).\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed through automatic charges, Stripe automatically finalizes your invoice and attempts payment. Note that finalizing the invoice, [when automatic](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/automatic-advancement-collection), does not happen immediately as the invoice is created. Stripe waits until one hour after the last webhook was successfully sent (or the last webhook timed out after failing). If you (and the platforms you may have connected to) have no webhooks configured, Stripe waits one hour after creation to finalize the invoice.\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed by sending an email, then based on your [email settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/billing/automatic), Stripe will email the invoice to your customer and await payment. These emails can contain a link to a hosted page to pay the invoice.\n\nStripe applies any customer credit on the account before determining the amount due for the invoice (i.e., the amount that will be actually charged). If the amount due for the invoice is less than Stripe’s [minimum allowed charge per currency](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts), the invoice is automatically marked paid, and we add the amount due to the customer’s credit balance which is applied to the next invoice.\n\nMore details on the customer’s credit balance are [here](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/customer/balance).\n\nRelated guide: [Send invoices to customers](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/invoices/sending)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create)[POST/v1/invoices/create\\_preview](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create_preview)[POST/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/lines/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_line)[GET/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/retrieve)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming)[GET/v1/invoices/:id/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming_invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/list)[DELETE/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/delete)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/add\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/add_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/remove\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/remove_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/update\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/finalize](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/finalize)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/mark\\_uncollectible](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/mark_uncollectible)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/pay](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/pay)[GET/v1/invoices/search](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/search)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/send](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/send)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/void](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/void)\n\n## [Meter Events](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event)\n\nA billing meter event represents a customer’s usage of a product. Meter events are used to bill a customer based on their usage. Meter events are associated with billing meters, which define the shape of the event’s payload and how those events are aggregated for billing.\n\n## [Meter Event Adjustment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_adjustment)\n\nA billing meter event adjustment is a resource that allows you to cancel a meter event. For example, you might create a billing meter event adjustment to cancel a meter event that was created in error or attached to the wrong customer.\n\n## [Meter Event Summary](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_summary)\n\nA billing meter event summary represents an aggregated view of a customer’s billing meter events within a specified timeframe. It indicates how much usage was accrued by a customer for that period.\n\n## [Plans](https://docs.stripe.com/api/plans)\n\nYou can now model subscriptions more flexibly using the [Prices API](#prices). It replaces the Plans API and is backwards compatible to simplify your migration.\n\nPlans define the base price, currency, and billing cycle for recurring purchases of products. [Products](#products) help you track inventory or provisioning, and plans help you track pricing. Different physical goods or levels of service should be represented by products, and pricing options should be represented by plans. This approach lets you change prices without having to change your provisioning scheme.\n\nFor example, you might have a single “gold” product that has plans for $10/month, $100/year, €9/month, and €90/year.\n\nRelated guides: [Set up a subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/set-up-subscription) and more about [products and prices](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/overview).\n\n## [Tax IDs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_create)[POST/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/create)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_retrieve)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/retrieve)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_list)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/list)[DELETE/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_delete)[DELETE/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/delete)\n\n## [Account Links](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_links)\n\nAccount Links are the means by which a Connect platform grants a connected account permission to access Stripe-hosted applications, such as Connect Onboarding.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect Onboarding](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom/hosted-onboarding)\n\n## [Account Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_sessions)\n\nAn AccountSession allows a Connect platform to grant access to a connected account in Connect embedded components.\n\nWe recommend that you create an AccountSession each time you need to display an embedded component to your user. Do not save AccountSessions to your database as they expire relatively quickly, and cannot be used more than once.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect embedded components](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-connect-embedded-components)\n\n## [Application Fees](https://docs.stripe.com/api/application_fees)\n\nWhen you collect a transaction fee on top of a charge made for your user (using [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)), an `Application Fee` object is created in your account. You can list, retrieve, and refund application fees.\n\nRelated guide: [Collecting application fees](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges#collect-fees)\n\n## [Country Specs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/country_specs)\n\nStripe needs to collect certain pieces of information about each account created. These requirements can differ depending on the account’s country. The Country Specs API makes these rules available to your integration.\n\nYou can also view the information from this API call as [an online guide](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information).\n\n## [Person](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/create)[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/update)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/retrieve)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/list)[DELETE/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/delete)\n\n## [Transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/transfers)\n\nA `Transfer` object is created when you move funds between Stripe accounts as part of Connect.\n\nBefore April 6, 2017, transfers also represented movement of funds from a Stripe account to a card or bank account. This behavior has since been split out into a [Payout](#payout_object) object, with corresponding payout endpoints. For more information, read about the [transfer/payout split](https://docs.stripe.com/transfer-payout-split).\n\nRelated guide: [Creating separate charges and transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n\n## [Secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/secret_management)\n\nSecret Store is an API that allows Stripe Apps developers to securely persist secrets for use by UI Extensions and app backends.\n\nThe primary resource in Secret Store is a `secret`.

For example, WisePOS E is a TerminalHardwareProduct and a WisePOS E - US and WisePOS E - UK are TerminalHardwareSKUs.\n\n## [Terminal Hardware SKU](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_skus)Preview feature\n\nA TerminalHardwareSKU represents a SKU for Terminal hardware. A SKU is a representation of a product available for purchase, containing information such as the name, price, and images.\n\n## [Transaction Entries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/transaction_entries)\n\nTransactionEntries represent individual units of money movements within a single [Transaction](#transactions).\n\n## [Scheduled Queries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/sigma/scheduled_queries)\n\nIf you have [scheduled a Sigma query](https://docs.stripe.com/sigma/scheduled-queries), you’ll receive a `sigma.scheduled_query_run.created` webhook each time the query runs. The webhook contains a `ScheduledQueryRun` object, which you can use to retrieve the query results.\n\n## [Report Types](https://docs.stripe.com/api/reporting/report_type)\n\nThe Report Type resource corresponds to a particular type of report, such as the “Activity summary” or “Itemized payouts” reports. These objects are identified by an ID belonging to a set of enumerated values. See [API Access to Reports documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/reporting/statements/api) for those Report Type IDs, along with required and optional parameters.\n\nNote that certain report types can only be run based on your live-mode data (not test-mode data), and will error when queried without a [live-mode API key](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#test-live-modes).\n\n## [Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/financial_connections/sessions)\n\nA Financial Connections Session is the secure way to programmatically launch the client-side Stripe.js modal that lets your users link their accounts.\n\n## [Verification Report](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_reports)\n\nA VerificationReport is the result of an attempt to collect and verify data from a user. The collection of verification checks performed is determined from the `type` and `options` parameters used. You can find the result of each verification check performed in the appropriate sub-resource: `document`, `id_number`, `selfie`.\n\nEach VerificationReport contains a copy of any data collected by the user as well as reference IDs which can be used to access collected images through the [FileUpload](https://docs.stripe.com/api/files) API. To configure and create VerificationReports, use the [VerificationSession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_sessions) API.\n\nRelated guide: [Accessing verification results](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verification-sessions#results).\n\n## [Crypto Onramp Quotes](https://docs.stripe.com/api/crypto/onramp_quotes)\n\nCrypto Onramp Quotes are estimated quotes for onramp conversions into all the different cryptocurrencies on different networks.

    "markdown": "# Validate an existing payment method domain\n\nSome payment methods such as Apple Pay require additional steps to verify a domain. If the requirements weren’t satisfied when the domain was created, the payment method will be inactive on the domain. The payment method doesn’t appear in Elements for this domain until it is active.\n\nTo activate a payment method on an existing payment method domain, complete the required validation steps specific to the payment method, and then validate the payment method domain with this endpoint.\n\nRelated guides: [Payment method domains](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/pmd-registration).\n\n### Parameters\n\nNo parameters.\n\n### Returns\n\nReturns the updated payment method domain object.\n\nPOST /v1/payment\\_method\\_domains/:id/validate\n\n```\ncurl -X POST https://api.stripe.com/v1/payment_method_domains/pmd_1Nnrer2eZvKYlo2Cips79tWl/validate \\  -u \"sk_test_4eC39Hq...arjtT1zdp7dcsk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc:\"\n```\n\n```\n{  \"id\": \"pmd_1Nnrer2eZvKYlo2Cips79tWl\",  \"object\": \"payment_method_domain\",  \"apple_pay\": {    \"status\": \"active\"  },  \"created\": 1694129445,  \"domain_name\": \"example.com\",  \"enabled\": true,  \"google_pay\": {    \"status\": \"active\"  },  \"link\": {    \"status\": \"active\"  },  \"livemode\": false,  \"paypal\": {    \"status\": \"active\"  }}\n```\n\n## [Cash Balance](https://docs.stripe.com/api/cash_balance)\n\nA customer’s `Cash balance` represents real funds. Customers can add funds to their cash balance by sending a bank transfer. These funds can be used for payment and can eventually be paid out to your bank account.\n\n## [Customer Portal Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customer_portal/sessions)\n\nThe Billing customer portal is a Stripe-hosted UI for subscription and billing management.\n\nA portal configuration describes the functionality and features that you want to provide to your customers through the portal.\n\nA portal session describes the instantiation of the customer portal for a particular customer. By visiting the session’s URL, the customer can manage their subscriptions and billing details. For security reasons, sessions are short-lived and will expire if the customer does not visit the URL. Create sessions on-demand when customers intend to manage their subscriptions and billing details.\n\nRelated guide: [Customer management](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management)\n\n## [Invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices)\n\nInvoices are statements of amounts owed by a customer, and are either generated one-off, or generated periodically from a subscription.\n\nThey contain [invoice items](#invoiceitems), and proration adjustments that may be caused by subscription upgrades/downgrades (if necessary).\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed through automatic charges, Stripe automatically finalizes your invoice and attempts payment. Note that finalizing the invoice, [when automatic](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/automatic-advancement-collection), does not happen immediately as the invoice is created. Stripe waits until one hour after the last webhook was successfully sent (or the last webhook timed out after failing). If you (and the platforms you may have connected to) have no webhooks configured, Stripe waits one hour after creation to finalize the invoice.\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed by sending an email, then based on your [email settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/billing/automatic), Stripe will email the invoice to your customer and await payment. These emails can contain a link to a hosted page to pay the invoice.\n\nStripe applies any customer credit on the account before determining the amount due for the invoice (i.e., the amount that will be actually charged). If the amount due for the invoice is less than Stripe’s [minimum allowed charge per currency](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts), the invoice is automatically marked paid, and we add the amount due to the customer’s credit balance which is applied to the next invoice.\n\nMore details on the customer’s credit balance are [here](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/customer/balance).\n\nRelated guide: [Send invoices to customers](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/invoices/sending)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create)[POST/v1/invoices/create\\_preview](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create_preview)[POST/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/lines/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_line)[GET/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/retrieve)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming)[GET/v1/invoices/:id/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming_invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/list)[DELETE/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/delete)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/add\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/add_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/remove\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/remove_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/update\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/finalize](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/finalize)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/mark\\_uncollectible](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/mark_uncollectible)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/pay](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/pay)[GET/v1/invoices/search](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/search)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/send](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/send)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/void](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/void)\n\n## [Meter Events](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event)\n\nA billing meter event represents a customer’s usage of a product. Meter events are used to bill a customer based on their usage. Meter events are associated with billing meters, which define the shape of the event’s payload and how those events are aggregated for billing.\n\n## [Meter Event Adjustment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_adjustment)\n\nA billing meter event adjustment is a resource that allows you to cancel a meter event. For example, you might create a billing meter event adjustment to cancel a meter event that was created in error or attached to the wrong customer.\n\n## [Meter Event Summary](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_summary)\n\nA billing meter event summary represents an aggregated view of a customer’s billing meter events within a specified timeframe. It indicates how much usage was accrued by a customer for that period.\n\n## [Plans](https://docs.stripe.com/api/plans)\n\nYou can now model subscriptions more flexibly using the [Prices API](#prices). It replaces the Plans API and is backwards compatible to simplify your migration.\n\nPlans define the base price, currency, and billing cycle for recurring purchases of products. [Products](#products) help you track inventory or provisioning, and plans help you track pricing. Different physical goods or levels of service should be represented by products, and pricing options should be represented by plans. This approach lets you change prices without having to change your provisioning scheme.\n\nFor example, you might have a single “gold” product that has plans for $10/month, $100/year, €9/month, and €90/year.\n\nRelated guides: [Set up a subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/set-up-subscription) and more about [products and prices](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/overview).\n\n## [Tax IDs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_create)[POST/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/create)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_retrieve)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/retrieve)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_list)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/list)[DELETE/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_delete)[DELETE/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/delete)\n\n## [Account Links](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_links)\n\nAccount Links are the means by which a Connect platform grants a connected account permission to access Stripe-hosted applications, such as Connect Onboarding.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect Onboarding](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom/hosted-onboarding)\n\n## [Account Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_sessions)\n\nAn AccountSession allows a Connect platform to grant access to a connected account in Connect embedded components.\n\nWe recommend that you create an AccountSession each time you need to display an embedded component to your user. Do not save AccountSessions to your database as they expire relatively quickly, and cannot be used more than once.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect embedded components](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-connect-embedded-components)\n\n## [Application Fees](https://docs.stripe.com/api/application_fees)\n\nWhen you collect a transaction fee on top of a charge made for your user (using [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)), an `Application Fee` object is created in your account. You can list, retrieve, and refund application fees.\n\nRelated guide: [Collecting application fees](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges#collect-fees)\n\n## [Country Specs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/country_specs)\n\nStripe needs to collect certain pieces of information about each account created. These requirements can differ depending on the account’s country. The Country Specs API makes these rules available to your integration.\n\nYou can also view the information from this API call as [an online guide](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information).\n\n## [Person](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/create)[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/update)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/retrieve)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/list)[DELETE/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/delete)\n\n## [Transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/transfers)\n\nA `Transfer` object is created when you move funds between Stripe accounts as part of Connect.\n\nBefore April 6, 2017, transfers also represented movement of funds from a Stripe account to a card or bank account. This behavior has since been split out into a [Payout](#payout_object) object, with corresponding payout endpoints. For more information, read about the [transfer/payout split](https://docs.stripe.com/transfer-payout-split).\n\nRelated guide: [Creating separate charges and transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n\n## [Secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/secret_management)\n\nSecret Store is an API that allows Stripe Apps developers to securely persist secrets for use by UI Extensions and app backends.\n\nThe primary resource in Secret Store is a `secret`. Other apps can’t view secrets created by an app. Additionally, secrets are scoped to provide further permission control.\n\nAll Dashboard users and the app backend share `account` scoped secrets. Use the `account` scope for secrets that don’t change per-user, like a third-party API key.\n\nA `user` scoped secret is accessible by the app backend and one specific Dashboard user. Use the `user` scope for per-user secrets like per-user OAuth tokens, where different users might have different permissions.\n\nRelated guide: [Store data between page reloads](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/store-auth-data-custom-objects)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[GET/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/list)[POST/v1/apps/secrets/delete](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/delete)[GET/v1/apps/secrets/find](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/find)[POST/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/set)\n\n## [Reviews](https://docs.stripe.com/api/radar/reviews)\n\nReviews can be used to supplement automated fraud detection with human expertise.\n\nLearn more about [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar) and reviewing payments [here](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/reviews).\n\n## [Authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/update)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/list)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/approve](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/approve)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/decline](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/decline)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_create)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/capture](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_capture)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/expire](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_expire)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/finalize\\_amount](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_finalize_amount)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/increment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_increment)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/fraud\\_challenges/respond](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/respond_to_fraud_challenges)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/reverse](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_reverse)\n\n## [Cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/create)[POST/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/update)[GET/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/list)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/deliver](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_deliver)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/fail](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_fail)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/return](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_return)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/ship](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_ship)\n\n## [Physical Bundles](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/physical_bundles)\n\nA Physical Bundle represents the bundle of physical items -

A SKU is a representation of a product available for purchase, containing information such as the name, price, and images.\n\n## [Transaction Entries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/transaction_entries)\n\nTransactionEntries represent individual units of money movements within a single [Transaction](#transactions).\n\n## [Scheduled Queries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/sigma/scheduled_queries)\n\nIf you have [scheduled a Sigma query](https://docs.stripe.com/sigma/scheduled-queries), you’ll receive a `sigma.scheduled_query_run.created` webhook each time the query runs. The webhook contains a `ScheduledQueryRun` object, which you can use to retrieve the query results.\n\n## [Report Types](https://docs.stripe.com/api/reporting/report_type)\n\nThe Report Type resource corresponds to a particular type of report, such as the “Activity summary” or “Itemized payouts” reports. These objects are identified by an ID belonging to a set of enumerated values. See [API Access to Reports documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/reporting/statements/api) for those Report Type IDs, along with required and optional parameters.\n\nNote that certain report types can only be run based on your live-mode data (not test-mode data), and will error when queried without a [live-mode API key](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#test-live-modes).\n\n## [Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/financial_connections/sessions)\n\nA Financial Connections Session is the secure way to programmatically launch the client-side Stripe.js modal that lets your users link their accounts.\n\n## [Verification Report](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_reports)\n\nA VerificationReport is the result of an attempt to collect and verify data from a user. The collection of verification checks performed is determined from the `type` and `options` parameters used. You can find the result of each verification check performed in the appropriate sub-resource: `document`, `id_number`, `selfie`.\n\nEach VerificationReport contains a copy of any data collected by the user as well as reference IDs which can be used to access collected images through the [FileUpload](https://docs.stripe.com/api/files) API. To configure and create VerificationReports, use the [VerificationSession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_sessions) API.\n\nRelated guide: [Accessing verification results](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verification-sessions#results).\n\n## [Crypto Onramp Quotes](https://docs.stripe.com/api/crypto/onramp_quotes)\n\nCrypto Onramp Quotes are estimated quotes for onramp conversions into all the different cryptocurrencies on different networks. The Quotes API allows you to display quotes in your product UI before directing the user to the onramp widget.\n\nRelated guide: [Quotes API](https://docs.stripe.com/crypto/quotes-api)\n\n## [Climate Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/climate/product)\n\nA Climate product represents a type of carbon removal unit available for reservation. You can retrieve it to see the current price and availability.\n\n## [Forwarding Request](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/request)\n\nInstructs Stripe to make a request on your behalf using the destination URL. The destination URL is activated by Stripe at the time of onboarding. Stripe verifies requests with your credentials provided during onboarding, and injects card details from the payment\\_method into the request.\n\nStripe redacts all sensitive fields and headers, including authentication credentials and card numbers, before storing the request and response data in the forwarding Request object, which are subject to a 30-day retention period.\n\nYou can provide a Stripe idempotency key to make sure that requests with the same key result in only one outbound request. The Stripe idempotency key provided should be unique and different from any idempotency keys provided on the underlying third-party request.\n\nForwarding Requests are synchronous requests that return a response or time out according to Stripe’s limits.\n\nRelated guide: [Forward card details to third-party API endpoints](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/forwarding).\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/create)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/retrieve)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/list)",

By visiting the session’s URL, the customer can manage their subscriptions and billing details. For security reasons, sessions are short-lived and will expire if the customer does not visit the URL. Create sessions on-demand when customers intend to manage their subscriptions and billing details.\n\nRelated guide: [Customer management](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management)\n\n## [Invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices)\n\nInvoices are statements of amounts owed by a customer, and are either generated one-off, or generated periodically from a subscription.\n\nThey contain [invoice items](#invoiceitems), and proration adjustments that may be caused by subscription upgrades/downgrades (if necessary).\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed through automatic charges, Stripe automatically finalizes your invoice and attempts payment. Note that finalizing the invoice, [when automatic](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/automatic-advancement-collection), does not happen immediately as the invoice is created. Stripe waits until one hour after the last webhook was successfully sent (or the last webhook timed out after failing). If you (and the platforms you may have connected to) have no webhooks configured, Stripe waits one hour after creation to finalize the invoice.\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed by sending an email, then based on your [email settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/billing/automatic), Stripe will email the invoice to your customer and await payment. These emails can contain a link to a hosted page to pay the invoice.\n\nStripe applies any customer credit on the account before determining the amount due for the invoice (i.e., the amount that will be actually charged). If the amount due for the invoice is less than Stripe’s [minimum allowed charge per currency](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts), the invoice is automatically marked paid, and we add the amount due to the customer’s credit balance which is applied to the next invoice.\n\nMore details on the customer’s credit balance are [here](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/customer/balance).\n\nRelated guide: [Send invoices to customers](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/invoices/sending)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create)[POST/v1/invoices/create\\_preview](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create_preview)[POST/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/lines/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_line)[GET/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/retrieve)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming)[GET/v1/invoices/:id/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming_invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/list)[DELETE/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/delete)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/add\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/add_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/remove\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/remove_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/update\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/finalize](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/finalize)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/mark\\_uncollectible](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/mark_uncollectible)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/pay](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/pay)[GET/v1/invoices/search](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/search)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/send](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/send)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/void](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/void)\n\n## [Meter Events](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event)\n\nA billing meter event represents a customer’s usage of a product. Meter events are used to bill a customer based on their usage. Meter events are associated with billing meters, which define the shape of the event’s payload and how those events are aggregated for billing.\n\n## [Meter Event Adjustment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_adjustment)\n\nA billing meter event adjustment is a resource that allows you to cancel a meter event. For example, you might create a billing meter event adjustment to cancel a meter event that was created in error or attached to the wrong customer.\n\n## [Meter Event Summary](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_summary)\n\nA billing meter event summary represents an aggregated view of a customer’s billing meter events within a specified timeframe. It indicates how much usage was accrued by a customer for that period.\n\n## [Plans](https://docs.stripe.com/api/plans)\n\nYou can now model subscriptions more flexibly using the [Prices API](#prices). It replaces the Plans API and is backwards compatible to simplify your migration.\n\nPlans define the base price, currency, and billing cycle for recurring purchases of products. [Products](#products) help you track inventory or provisioning, and plans help you track pricing. Different physical goods or levels of service should be represented by products, and pricing options should be represented by plans. This approach lets you change prices without having to change your provisioning scheme.\n\nFor example, you might have a single “gold” product that has plans for $10/month, $100/year, €9/month, and €90/year.\n\nRelated guides: [Set up a subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/set-up-subscription) and more about [products and prices](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/overview).\n\n## [Tax IDs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_create)[POST/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/create)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_retrieve)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/retrieve)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_list)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/list)[DELETE/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_delete)[DELETE/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/delete)\n\n## [Account Links](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_links)\n\nAccount Links are the means by which a Connect platform grants a connected account permission to access Stripe-hosted applications, such as Connect Onboarding.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect Onboarding](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom/hosted-onboarding)\n\n## [Account Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_sessions)\n\nAn AccountSession allows a Connect platform to grant access to a connected account in Connect embedded components.\n\nWe recommend that you create an AccountSession each time you need to display an embedded component to your user. Do not save AccountSessions to your database as they expire relatively quickly, and cannot be used more than once.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect embedded components](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-connect-embedded-components)\n\n## [Application Fees](https://docs.stripe.com/api/application_fees)\n\nWhen you collect a transaction fee on top of a charge made for your user (using [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)), an `Application Fee` object is created in your account. You can list, retrieve, and refund application fees.\n\nRelated guide: [Collecting application fees](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges#collect-fees)\n\n## [Country Specs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/country_specs)\n\nStripe needs to collect certain pieces of information about each account created. These requirements can differ depending on the account’s country. The Country Specs API makes these rules available to your integration.\n\nYou can also view the information from this API call as [an online guide](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information).\n\n## [Person](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/create)[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/update)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/retrieve)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/list)[DELETE/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/delete)\n\n## [Transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/transfers)\n\nA `Transfer` object is created when you move funds between Stripe accounts as part of Connect.\n\nBefore April 6, 2017, transfers also represented movement of funds from a Stripe account to a card or bank account. This behavior has since been split out into a [Payout](#payout_object) object, with corresponding payout endpoints. For more information, read about the [transfer/payout split](https://docs.stripe.com/transfer-payout-split).\n\nRelated guide: [Creating separate charges and transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n\n## [Secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/secret_management)\n\nSecret Store is an API that allows Stripe Apps developers to securely persist secrets for use by UI Extensions and app backends.\n\nThe primary resource in Secret Store is a `secret`. Other apps can’t view secrets created by an app. Additionally, secrets are scoped to provide further permission control.\n\nAll Dashboard users and the app backend share `account` scoped secrets. Use the `account` scope for secrets that don’t change per-user, like a third-party API key.\n\nA `user` scoped secret is accessible by the app backend and one specific Dashboard user. Use the `user` scope for per-user secrets like per-user OAuth tokens, where different users might have different permissions.\n\nRelated guide: [Store data between page reloads](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/store-auth-data-custom-objects)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[GET/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/list)[POST/v1/apps/secrets/delete](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/delete)[GET/v1/apps/secrets/find](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/find)[POST/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/set)\n\n## [Reviews](https://docs.stripe.com/api/radar/reviews)\n\nReviews can be used to supplement automated fraud detection with human expertise.\n\nLearn more about [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar) and reviewing payments [here](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/reviews).\n\n## [Authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/update)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/list)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/approve](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/approve)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/decline](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/decline)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_create)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/capture](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_capture)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/expire](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_expire)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/finalize\\_amount](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_finalize_amount)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/increment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_increment)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/fraud\\_challenges/respond](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/respond_to_fraud_challenges)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/reverse](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_reverse)\n\n## [Cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/create)[POST/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/update)[GET/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/list)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/deliver](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_deliver)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/fail](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_fail)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/return](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_return)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/ship](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_ship)\n\n## [Physical Bundles](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/physical_bundles)\n\nA Physical Bundle represents the bundle of physical items -

For example, WisePOS E is a TerminalHardwareProduct and a WisePOS E - US and WisePOS E - UK are TerminalHardwareSKUs.\n\n## [Terminal Hardware SKU](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_skus)Preview feature\n\nA TerminalHardwareSKU represents a SKU for Terminal hardware. A SKU is a representation of a product available for purchase, containing information such as the name, price, and images.\n\n## [Transaction Entries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/transaction_entries)\n\nTransactionEntries represent individual units of money movements within a single [Transaction](#transactions).\n\n## [Scheduled Queries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/sigma/scheduled_queries)\n\nIf you have [scheduled a Sigma query](https://docs.stripe.com/sigma/scheduled-queries), you’ll receive a `sigma.scheduled_query_run.created` webhook each time the query runs. The webhook contains a `ScheduledQueryRun` object, which you can use to retrieve the query results.\n\n## [Report Types](https://docs.stripe.com/api/reporting/report_type)\n\nThe Report Type resource corresponds to a particular type of report, such as the “Activity summary” or “Itemized payouts” reports. These objects are identified by an ID belonging to a set of enumerated values. See [API Access to Reports documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/reporting/statements/api) for those Report Type IDs, along with required and optional parameters.\n\nNote that certain report types can only be run based on your live-mode data (not test-mode data), and will error when queried without a [live-mode API key](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#test-live-modes).\n\n## [Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/financial_connections/sessions)\n\nA Financial Connections Session is the secure way to programmatically launch the client-side Stripe.js modal that lets your users link their accounts.\n\n## [Verification Report](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_reports)\n\nA VerificationReport is the result of an attempt to collect and verify data from a user. The collection of verification checks performed is determined from the `type` and `options` parameters used. You can find the result of each verification check performed in the appropriate sub-resource: `document`, `id_number`, `selfie`.\n\nEach VerificationReport contains a copy of any data collected by the user as well as reference IDs which can be used to access collected images through the [FileUpload](https://docs.stripe.com/api/files) API. To configure and create VerificationReports, use the [VerificationSession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_sessions) API.\n\nRelated guide: [Accessing verification results](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verification-sessions#results).\n\n## [Crypto Onramp Quotes](https://docs.stripe.com/api/crypto/onramp_quotes)\n\nCrypto Onramp Quotes are estimated quotes for onramp conversions into all the different cryptocurrencies on different networks. The Quotes API allows you to display quotes in your product UI before directing the user to the onramp widget.\n\nRelated guide: [Quotes API](https://docs.stripe.com/crypto/quotes-api)\n\n## [Climate Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/climate/product)\n\nA Climate product represents a type of carbon removal unit available for reservation. You can retrieve it to see the current price and availability.\n\n## [Forwarding Request](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/request)\n\nInstructs Stripe to make a request on your behalf using the destination URL. The destination URL is activated by Stripe at the time of onboarding. Stripe verifies requests with your credentials provided during onboarding, and injects card details from the payment\\_method into the request.\n\nStripe redacts all sensitive fields and headers, including authentication credentials and card numbers, before storing the request and response data in the forwarding Request object, which are subject to a 30-day retention period.\n\nYou can provide a Stripe idempotency key to make sure that requests with the same key result in only one outbound request. The Stripe idempotency key provided should be unique and different from any idempotency keys provided on the underlying third-party request.\n\nForwarding Requests are synchronous requests that return a response or time out according to Stripe’s limits.\n\nRelated guide: [Forward card details to third-party API endpoints](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/forwarding).\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/create)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/retrieve)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/list)",
