    "markdown": "# Comprehensive Cypress Test Automation Guide\n\n## Why Cypress?\n\ninfo\n\n## What you'll learn[​](#What-youll-learn \"Direct link to What-youll-learn\")\n\n*   What Cypress is and why you should use it\n*   Our mission, and what we believe in\n*   Key Cypress features\n*   Types of tests Cypress is designed for\n\n## In a nutshell[​](#In-a-nutshell \"Direct link to In a nutshell\")\n\nCypress is a next generation front end testing tool built for the modern web. We address the key pain points developers and QA engineers face when testing modern applications.\n\nWe make it possible to:\n\n*   [Set up tests](#Setting-up-tests)\n*   [Write tests](#Writing-tests)\n*   [Run tests](#Running-tests)\n*   [Debug Tests](#Debugging-tests)\n\nCypress is most often compared to Selenium; however Cypress is both fundamentally and architecturally different. Cypress is not constrained by the same restrictions as Selenium.\n\nThis enables you to **write faster**, **easier** and **more reliable** tests.\n\n## Who uses Cypress?[​](#Who-uses-Cypress \"Direct link to Who uses Cypress?\")\n\nOur users are typically developers or QA engineers building web applications using modern JavaScript frameworks.\n\nCypress enables you to write all types of tests:\n\n*   [End-to-end tests](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/end-to-end-testing/writing-your-first-end-to-end-test)\n*   [Component tests](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/component-testing/overview)\n*   Integration tests\n*   Unit tests\n\nCypress can test anything that runs in a browser.\n\n## Cypress ecosystem[​](#Cypress-ecosystem \"Direct link to Cypress ecosystem\")\n\nCypress consists of a free, [open source](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress), [locally installed](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress) application **and** Cypress Cloud for [recording your tests](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/cloud/introduction).\n\n*   **First:** Cypress helps you set up and start writing tests every day while you build your application locally. _TDD at its best!_\n*   **Later:** After building up a suite of tests and [integrating Cypress](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/continuous-integration/introduction) with your CI Provider, [Cypress Cloud](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/cloud/introduction) can record your test runs. You'll never have to wonder: _Why did this fail?_\n\n## Our mission[​](#Our-mission \"Direct link to Our mission\")\n\nOur mission is to build a thriving, open source ecosystem that enhances productivity, makes testing an enjoyable experience, and generates developer happiness. We hold ourselves accountable to champion a testing process **that actually works**.\n\nWe believe our documentation should be approachable. This means enabling our readers to understand fully not just the **what** but the **why** as well.\n\nWe want to help developers build a new generation of modern applications faster, better, and without the stress and anxiety associated with managing tests. We aim to elevate the art of software development by leveraging test results to generate actionable insights for long-term stability by proactively identifying areas for improvement.\n\nWe know that in order for us to be successful we must enable, nurture, and foster an ecosystem that thrives on open source. Every line of test code is an investment in **your codebase**, it will never be coupled to us as a paid service or company. Tests will be able to run and work independently, _always_.\n\nWe believe testing needs a lot of ❤️ and we are here to build a tool, a service, and a community that everyone can learn and benefit from. We're solving the hardest pain points shared by every developer working on the web. We believe in this mission and hope that you will join us to make Cypress a lasting ecosystem that makes everyone happy.\n\n## Features[​](#Features \"Direct link to Features\")\n\nCypress comes fully baked, batteries included. Here is a list of things it can do that no other testing framework can:\n\n*   **Time Travel:** Cypress takes snapshots as your tests run. Hover over commands in the [Command Log](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/cypress-app#Command-Log) to see exactly what happened at each step.\n*   **Debuggability:** Stop guessing why your tests are failing. [Debug directly](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/debugging) from familiar tools like Developer Tools. Our readable errors and stack traces make debugging lightning fast.\n*   **Automatic Waiting:** Never add waits or sleeps to your tests. Cypress [automatically waits](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/introduction-to-cypress#Cypress-is-Not-Like-jQuery) for commands and assertions before moving on. No more async hell.\n*   **Spies, Stubs, and Clocks:** Verify and [control the behavior](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/stubs-spies-and-clocks) of functions, server responses, or timers. The same functionality you love from unit testing is right at your fingertips.\n*   **Network Traffic Control:** Easily [control, stub, and test edge cases](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/network-requests) without involving your server. You can stub network traffic however you like.\n*   **Consistent Results:** Our architecture doesn't use Selenium or WebDriver. Say hello to fast, consistent and reliable tests that are flake-free.\n*   **Screenshots, Videos, and Test Replay:** View screenshots taken automatically on failure, or videos, if enabled, of your entire test suite when run from the CLI. Record to [Cypress Cloud](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/cloud/introduction) and replay the test as it executed during the run for zero-configuration debugging using [Test Replay](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/cloud/test-replay).\n*   **Cross Browser Testing:** Run tests within Firefox and Chrome-family browsers (including Edge and Electron) locally and [optimally in a Continuous Integration pipeline](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/cross-browser-testing).\n*   **Smart Orchestration:** Once you're set up to record to Cypress Cloud, easily [parallelize](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/cloud/smart-orchestration/parallelization) your test suite, rerun failed specs first with [Spec Prioritization](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/cloud/smart-orchestration/spec-prioritization), and cancel test runs on failures with [Auto Cancellation](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/cloud/smart-orchestration/run-cancellation) for tight feedback loops.\n*   **Flake Detection:** Discover and diagnose unreliable tests with Cypress Cloud's [Flaky test management](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/cloud/flaky-test-management).\n\n### Setting up tests[​](#Setting-up-tests \"Direct link to Setting-up-tests\")\n\nThere are no servers, drivers, or any other dependencies to install or configure. You can quickly see your first passing test using template example test specs for [End-to-end tests](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/end-to-end-testing/writing-your-first-end-to-end-test) or [Component tests](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/component-testing/getting-started).\n\n### Writing tests[​](#Writing-tests \"Direct link to Writing-tests\")\n\nTests written in Cypress are meant to be easy to read and understand. Our API comes fully baked, on top of tools you are familiar with already.\n\n### Running tests[​](#Running-tests \"Direct link to Running-tests\")\n\nCypress runs as fast as your browser can render content. You can watch tests run in real time as you develop your applications. TDD FTW!\n\n### Debugging tests[​](#Debugging-tests \"Direct link to Debugging-tests\")\n\nReadable error messages help you to debug quickly. You also have access to all the developer tools you know and love.\n\n## Test types[​](#Test-types \"Direct link to Test types\")\n\nCypress can be used to write several different types of tests. This can provide even more confidence that your application under test is working as intended.\n\n### End-to-end[​](#End-to-end \"Direct link to End-to-end\")\n\nCypress was originally designed to run end-to-end (E2E) tests on anything that runs in a browser. A typical E2E test visits the application in a browser and performs actions via the UI just like a real user would.\n\n```\nit('adds todos', () => {  cy.visit('https://example.cypress.io/')  cy.get('[data-testid=\"new-todo\"]')    .type('write code{enter}')    .type('write tests{enter}')  // confirm the application is showing two items  cy.get('[data-testid=\"todos\"]').should('have.length', 2)})\n```\n\n### Component[​](#Component \"Direct link to Component\")\n\nYou can also use Cypress to mount components from supported web frameworks and execute [component tests](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/component-testing/overview).\n\n```\nimport TodoList from './components/TodoList'it('contains the correct number of todos', () => {  const todos = [    { text: 'Buy milk', id: 1 },    { text: 'Learn Component Testing', id: 2 },  ]  cy.mount(<TodoList todos={todos} />)  // the component starts running like a mini web app  cy.get('[data-testid=\"todos\"]').should('have.length', todos.length)})\n```\n\n### API[​](#API \"Direct link to API\")\n\nCypress can perform arbitrary HTTP calls, thus you can use it for API testing.\n\n```\nit('adds a todo', () => {  cy.request({    url: '/todos',    method: 'POST',    body: {      title: 'Write REST API',    },  })    .its('body')    .should('deep.contain', {      title: 'Write REST API',      completed: false,    })})\n```\n\n### Other[​](#Other \"Direct link to Other\")\n\nFinally, through a large number of [official and 3rd party plugins](https://docs.cypress.io/plugins) you can write Cypress [a11y](https://github.com/component-driven/cypress-axe),\n\n[visual](https://docs.cypress.io/plugins#visual-testing), [email](https://docs.cypress.io/faq/questions/using-cypress-faq#How-do-I-check-that-an-email-was-sent-out) and other types of tests.\n\n## Cypress in the Real World[​](#Cypress-in-the-Real-World \"Direct link to Cypress in the Real World\")\n\n![Cypress Real World App](https://docs.cypress.io/img/guides/overview/v10/real-world-app.png)\n\nCypress makes it quick and easy to start testing, and as you begin to test your app, **you'll often wonder if you're using best practices or scalable strategies**.\n\nTo guide the way, the Cypress team has created the [Real World App (RWA)](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-realworld-app), a full stack example application that demonstrates testing with **Cypress in practical and realistic scenarios.**\n\nThe RWA achieves full [code-coverage](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/tooling/code-coverage) with end-to-end tests [across multiple browsers](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/cross-browser-testing) and [device sizes](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/viewport), but also includes [visual regression tests](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/tooling/visual-testing), API tests, unit tests, and runs them all in an [efficient CI pipeline](https://cloud.cypress.io/projects/7s5okt). Use the RWA to **learn, experiment, tinker, and practice** web application testing with Cypress.\n\nThe app is bundled with everything you need, [just clone the repository](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-realworld-app) and start testing.",

    "markdown": "# Command Line | Cypress Documentation\n\ninfo\n\n## What you'll learn[​](#What-youll-learn \"Direct link to What-youll-learn\")\n\n*   How to run Cypress from the command line\n*   How to specify which spec files to run\n*   How to launch other browsers\n*   How to record your tests to Cypress Cloud\n\n## Installation[​](#Installation \"Direct link to Installation\")\n\nThis guide assumes you've already read our [Installing Cypress](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress) guide and installed Cypress as an `npm` module. After installing you'll be able to execute all of the commands in this document from your **project root**.\n\n## How to run commands[​](#How-to-run-commands \"Direct link to How to run commands\")\n\nYou can run Cypress from your **project root** using a command which depends on the package manager you are using: npm, Yarn or pnpm. For example, you would prefix the command [cypress run](#cypress-run) as shown:\n\n*   npm\n*   Yarn\n*   pnpm\n\nAdd any required [options](#Options) to the end of the command line. As an example, if you want to run tests in headless mode from a single spec file and record the results with Cypress Cloud, the command should be:\n\n*   npm\n*   Yarn\n*   pnpm\n\n```\nnpx cypress run --record --spec \"cypress/e2e/my-spec.cy.js\"\n```\n\ninfo\n\nYou can alternatively require and run Cypress as a node module using our [Module API](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/module-api).\n\n## Using scripts[​](#Using-scripts \"Direct link to Using scripts\")\n\nCypress command strings can be saved as scripts for reuse.\n\nLet's say you often need to run Cypress E2E tests in headless mode using the Chrome browser. You can add the corresponding command `cypress run --browser chrome` to the `scripts` object in your `package.json` file and use the name `e2e:chrome` to identify it.\n\n```\n{  \"scripts\": {    \"e2e:chrome\": \"cypress run --browser chrome\"  }}\n```\n\nRunning the script `e2e:chrome` as follows will run the command you defined:\n\n*   npm\n*   Yarn\n*   pnpm\n\ncaution\n\n**Best Practice**\n\nDon't use `cypress` as the exact name of a script, especially if you use Yarn as package manager. When running commands on the Cypress binary (e.g. `yarn cypress verify`), Yarn will reference the script of the same name instead and Cypress CLI commands may not work as expected.\n\n### Extending script options[​](#Extending-script-options \"Direct link to Extending script options\")\n\nYou do not have to define a new script for every variation of a command string you need. You can extend a script with additional options.\n\nLet's say that when you ran the full set of tests with the script `e2e:chrome` it showed a failure in one test spec `cypress/e2e/my-spec.cy.js`. You corrected the problem and would like to re-run the tests only for the test spec which previously failed.\n\nThe option [`--spec`](#cypress-run-spec-lt-spec-gt) allows you to specify which test specs to run, so you can add this to the command after the script name `e2e:chrome`:\n\n*   npm\n*   Yarn\n*   pnpm\n\n```\nnpm run e2e:chrome -- --spec \"cypress/e2e/my-spec.cy.js\"\n```\n\nRefer to each package manager's documentation for full details of command and script usage:\n\n*   [npm CLI](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/)  \n    When adding Cypress [options](#Options) after a script name called from `npm`, you need to pass the command's arguments using the `--` string (see [`npm-run-script`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/run-script.html)).\n*   [Yarn CLI](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/)\n*   [pnpm CLI](https://pnpm.io/pnpm-cli)\n\n## Commands[​](#Commands \"Direct link to Commands\")\n\ninfo\n\nThe prefix required to run `cypress` is not shown in the list of commands below. You need to add the prefix `npx`, `yarn` or `pnpm` to the command line, corresponding to the package manager you are using. See [How to run commands](#How-to-run-commands).\n\n### `cypress run`[​](#cypress-run \"Direct link to cypress-run\")\n\nRuns Cypress tests to completion. By default, `cypress run` will run all tests headlessly.\n\n#### Options[​](#Options \"Direct link to Options\")\n\n| Option | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `--auto-cancel-after-failures` | [Overrides the Cloud project-level configuration to set the failed test threshold for auto cancellation or to disable auto cancellation when recording to the Cloud](#auto-cancel-after-runs) |\n| `--browser`, `-b` | [Run Cypress in the browser with the given name. If a filesystem path is supplied, Cypress will attempt to use the browser at that path.](#cypress-run-browser-lt-browser-name-or-path-gt) |\n| `--ci-build-id` | [Specify a unique identifier for a run to enable grouping or parallelization.](#cypress-run-ci-build-id-lt-id-gt) |\n| `--component` | [Run component tests](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/testing-types#What-is-Component-Testing) |\n| `--config`, `-c` | [Specify configuration](#cypress-run-config-lt-config-gt) |\n| `--config-file`, `-C` | [Specify configuration file](#cypress-run-config-file-lt-configuration-file-gt) |\n| `--e2e` | Run end to end tests (default) |\n| `--env`, `-e` | [Specify environment variables](#cypress-run-env-lt-env-gt) |\n| `--group` | [Group recorded tests together under a single run](#cypress-run-group-lt-name-gt) |\n| `--headed` | [Displays the browser instead of running headlessly](#cypress-run-headed) |\n| `--headless` | Hide the browser instead of running headed (default during `cypress run`) |\n| `--help`, `-h` | Output usage information |\n| `--key`, `-k` | [Specify your secret record key](#cypress-run-record-key-lt-record-key-gt) |\n| `--no-exit` | [Keep Cypress open after tests in a spec file run](#cypress-run-no-exit) |\n| `--no-runner-ui` | [Hides the Cypress Runner UI](#cypress-run-no-runner-ui) |\n| `--parallel` | [Run recorded specs in parallel across multiple machines](#cypress-run-parallel) |\n| `--port`,`-p` | [Override default port](#cypress-run-port-lt-port-gt) |\n| `--project`, `-P` | [Path to a specific project](#cypress-run-project-lt-project-path-gt) |\n| `--quiet`, `-q` | If passed, Cypress output will not be printed to `stdout`. Only output from the configured [Mocha reporter](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/tooling/reporters) will print. |\n| `--record` | [Whether to record the test run](#cypress-run-record-key-lt-record-key-gt) |\n| `--reporter`, `-r` | [Specify a Mocha reporter](#cypress-run-reporter-lt-reporter-gt) |\n| `--reporter-options`, `-o` | [Specify Mocha reporter options](#cypress-run-reporter-lt-reporter-gt) |\n| `--runner-ui` | [Displays the Cypress Runner UI. Useful for when Test Replay is enabled and you would still like the Cypress Runner UI to be displayed for screenshots and video](#cypress-run-runner-ui) |\n| `--spec`, `-s` | [Specify the spec files to run](#cypress-run-spec-lt-spec-gt) |\n| `--tag`, `-t` | [Identify a run with a tag or tags](#cypress-run-tag-lt-tag-gt) |\n\n#### `cypress run --auto-cancel-after-failures <autoCancelAfterFailures>`[​](#auto-cancel-after-runs \"Direct link to auto-cancel-after-runs\")\n\n> Note: Available in Cypress 12.6.0 and later\n\nThe \"autoCancelAfterFailures\" argument is the number of times tests can fail before the run is canceled\n\n```\ncypress run --record --key <<your_record_key>> --auto-cancel-after-failures 1\n```\n\nYou can also specify `false` for the value to disable Auto Cancellation for the run:\n\n```\ncypress run --record --key <<your_record_key>> --auto-cancel-after-failures false\n```\n\n#### `cypress run --browser <browser-name-or-path>`[​](#cypress-run-browser-lt-browser-name-or-path-gt \"Direct link to cypress-run-browser-lt-browser-name-or-path-gt\")\n\n```\ncypress run --browser chrome\n```\n\nThe \"browser\" argument can be set to `chrome`, `chromium`, `edge`, `electron`, `firefox` to launch a browser detected on your system. Cypress will attempt to automatically find the installed browser for you.\n\nTo launch non-stable browsers, add a colon and the desired release channel. For example, to launch Chrome Canary, use `chrome:canary`.\n\nYou can also choose a browser by supplying a path:\n\n```\ncypress run --browser /usr/bin/chromium\n```\n\n[Having trouble with browser detection? Check out our troubleshooting guide](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/troubleshooting#Launching-browsers)\n\n#### `cypress run --ci-build-id <id>`[​](#cypress-run-ci-build-id-lt-id-gt \"Direct link to cypress-run-ci-build-id-lt-id-gt\")\n\nThis value should be automatically detected for most CI providers and is unnecessary to define unless Cypress is unable to determine it.\n\nTypically, this is defined as an environment variable within your CI provider, defining a unique \"build\" or \"run\".\n\n```\ncypress run --ci-build-id BUILD_NUMBER\n```\n\nOnly valid when providing a `--group` or `--parallel` flag. Read our [parallelization](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/cloud/smart-orchestration/parallelization) documentation to learn more.\n\n#### `cypress run --config <config>`[​](#cypress-run-config-lt-config-gt \"Direct link to cypress-run-config-lt-config-gt\")\n\nSet [configuration](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration) values. Separate multiple values with commas. The values set here override any values set in your configuration file.\n\n```\ncypress run --config pageLoadTimeout=100000,watchForFileChanges=false\n```\n\nFor more complex configuration objects, you may want to consider passing a [JSON.stringified](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify) object surrounded by single quotes.\n\nHere, we're passing in the configuration for component spec files.\n\n```\ncypress run --config '{\"watchForFileChanges\":false,\"specPattern\":[\"**/*.cy.js\",\"**/*.cy.ts\"]}'\n```\n\n#### `cypress run --config-file <configuration-file>`[​](#cypress-run-config-file-lt-configuration-file-gt \"Direct link to cypress-run-config-file-lt-configuration-file-gt\")\n\nYou can specify a path to a file where [Cypress configuration](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration) values are set.\n\n```\ncypress run --config-file tests/cypress.config.js\n```\n\n#### `cypress run --env <env>`[​](#cypress-run-env-lt-env-gt \"Direct link to cypress-run-env-lt-env-gt\")\n\nSet Cypress [environment variables](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/environment-variables).\n\n```\ncypress run --env host=api.dev.local\n```\n\nPass several variables using commas and no spaces. Numbers are automatically converted from strings.\n\n```\ncypress run --env host=api.dev.local,port=4222\n```\n\nPass an object as a JSON in a string.\n\n```\ncypress run --env flags='{\"feature-a\":true,\"feature-b\":false}'\n```\n\n#### `cypress run --group <name>`[​](#cypress-run-group-lt-name-gt \"Direct link to cypress-run-group-lt-name-gt\")\n\nGroup recorded tests together under a single run.\n\n```\ncypress run --group develop-env\n```\n\nYou can add multiple groups to the same run by passing a different name. This can help distinguish groups of specs from each other.\n\n```\ncypress run --group admin-tests --spec 'cypress/e2e/admin/**/*'\n```\n\n```\ncypress run --group user-tests --spec 'cypress/e2e/user/**/*'\n```\n\nSpecifying the `--ci-build-id` may also be necessary.\n\n[Read more about grouping.](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/cloud/smart-orchestration/parallelization#Grouping-test-runs)\n\n#### `cypress run --headed`[​](#cypress-run-headed \"Direct link to cypress-run-headed\")\n\nBy default, Cypress will run tests headlessly during `cypress run`.\n\nPassing `--headed` will force the browser to be shown. This matches how you run any browser via `cypress open`.\n\n#### `cypress run --no-exit`[​](#cypress-run-no-exit \"Direct link to cypress-run-no-exit\")\n\nTo prevent Cypress from exiting after running tests in a spec file, use `--no-exit`.\n\nYou can pass `--headed --no-exit` in order to view the **command log** or have access to **developer tools** after a `spec` has run.\n\n```\ncypress run --headed --no-exit\n```\n\n#### `cypress run --no-runner-ui`[​](#cypress-run-no-runner-ui \"Direct link to cypress-run-no-runner-ui\")\n\nTo prevent Cypress from rendering the Runner UI, use `--no-runner-ui`.\n\n```\ncypress run --no-runner-ui\n```\n\n#### `cypress run --parallel`[​](#cypress-run-parallel \"Direct link to cypress-run-parallel\")\n\nRun recorded specs in [parallel](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/cloud/smart-orchestration/parallelization) across multiple machines.\n\n```\ncypress run --record --parallel\n```\n\nYou can additionally pass a `--group` flag so this shows up as a named [group](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/cloud/smart-orchestration/parallelization#Grouping-test-runs).\n\n```\ncypress run --record --parallel --group e2e-staging-specs\n```\n\nRead our [parallelization](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/cloud/smart-orchestration/parallelization) documentation to learn more.\n\n#### `cypress run --port <port>`[​](#cypress-run-port-lt-port-gt \"Direct link to cypress-run-port-lt-port-gt\")\n\n#### `cypress run --project <project-path>`[​](#cypress-run-project-lt-project-path-gt \"Direct link to cypress-run-project-lt-project-path-gt\")\n\nTo see this in action we've set up an [example repo to demonstrate this here](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-test-nested-projects).\n\n```\ncypress run --project ./some/nested/folder\n```\n\n#### `cypress run --record --key <record-key>`[​](#cypress-run-record-key-lt-record-key-gt \"Direct link to cypress-run-record-key-lt-record-key-gt\")\n\nRecord your test results to [Cypress Cloud](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/cloud/introduction). For this option to work you must first [set up your project to record](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/cloud/getting-started#Setup), make sure your `projectId` is set in your [Cypress configuration file](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration#Configuration-File), and append your **Record Key** to the command.\n\n```\ncypress run --record --key <record_key>\n```\n\nIf you set the **Record Key** as the environment variable `CYPRESS_RECORD_KEY`, you can omit the `--key` flag. You'd typically set this environment variable when running in [Continuous Integration](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/continuous-integration/introduction).\n\n```\nexport CYPRESS_RECORD_KEY=abc-key-123\n```\n\nNow you can omit the `--key` flag.\n\nFor more information on recording runs, see the [Cypress Cloud setup instructions](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/cloud/getting-started#Setup). For an in-depth explanation of how Cypress uses your record key and `projectId` to save your test results to Cypress Cloud, see the [Identification section](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/cloud/account-management/projects#Identification).\n\n#### `cypress run --reporter <reporter>`[​](#cypress-run-reporter-lt-reporter-gt \"Direct link to cypress-run-reporter-lt-reporter-gt\")\n\nYou can tests specifying a specific [Mocha reporter](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/tooling/reporters).\n\n```\ncypress run --reporter json\n```\n\nYou can specify reporter options using the `--reporter-options <reporter-options>` flag.\n\n```\ncypress run --reporter junit --reporter-options mochaFile=result.xml,toConsole=true\n```\n\n#### `cypress run --runner-ui`[​](#cypress-run-runner-ui \"Direct link to cypress-run-runner-ui\")\n\nTo force Cypress to render the Runner UI, use `--runner-ui`.\n\nUseful for when [Test Replay](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/cloud/test-replay) is enabled and you would still like the Runner UI to be rendered for screenshots and video.\n\n#### `cypress run --spec <spec>`[​](#cypress-run-spec-lt-spec-gt \"Direct link to cypress-run-spec-lt-spec-gt\")\n\nRun tests specifying a single test file to run instead of all tests. The spec path should be an absolute path or can be relative to the current working directory.\n\n```\ncypress run --spec \"cypress/e2e/examples/actions.cy.js\"\n```\n\nRun tests within the folder matching the glob _(Note: Using double quotes is strongly recommended)_.\n\n```\ncypress run --spec \"cypress/e2e/login/**/*\"\n```\n\nRun tests specifying multiple test files to run.\n\n```\ncypress run --spec \"cypress/e2e/examples/actions.cy.js,cypress/e2e/examples/files.cy.js\"\n```\n\nUse in combination with `--project` parameter. Imagine the Cypress tests are in a subfolder `tests/e2e` of the current project:\n\n```\napp/  node_modules/  package.json  tests/    unit/    e2e/      cypress/        e2e/          spec.cy.js      cypress.config.js\n```\n\nIf we are in the `app` folder, we can run the specs using the following command\n\n```\ncypress run --project tests/e2e --spec ./tests/e2e/cypress/e2e/spec.cy.js\n```\n\n#### `cypress run --tag <tag>`[​](#cypress-run-tag-lt-tag-gt \"Direct link to cypress-run-tag-lt-tag-gt\")\n\nAdd a tag or tags to the recorded run. This can be used to help identify separate runs when displayed in Cypress Cloud.\n\n```\ncypress run  --record --tag \"staging\"\n```\n\nGive a run multiple tags.\n\n```\ncypress run --record --tag \"production,nightly\"\n```\n\nCypress Cloud will display any tags sent with the appropriate run.\n\n![Cypress run in Cypress Cloud displaying flags](https://docs.cypress.io/img/guides/cloud/runs/dashboard-run-with-tags.png)\n\n#### Exit code[​](#Exit-code \"Direct link to Exit code\")\n\nWhen Cypress finishes running tests, it exits. If there are no failed tests, the exit code will be 0.\n\n```\n## All tests pass$ cypress run...                                        Tests  Passing  Failing    ✔  All specs passed!      00:16       17       17        0## print exit code on Mac or Linux$ echo $?0\n```\n\nIf there are any test failures, then the exit code will match the number of tests that failed.\n\n```\n## Spec with two failing tests$ cypress run...                                        Tests  Passing  Failing    ✖  1 of 1 failed (100%)   00:22       17       14        2## print exit code on Mac or Linux$ echo $?2\n```\n\nIf Cypress could not run for some reason (for example if no spec files were found) then the exit code will be 1.\n\n```\n## No spec files found$ cypress run --spec not-found.js...Can't run because no spec files were found.We searched for any files matching this glob pattern:not-found.js## print exit code on Mac or Linux$ echo $?1\n```\n\n### `cypress open`[​](#cypress-open \"Direct link to cypress-open\")\n\nOpens Cypress.\n\n#### Options:[​](#Options-1 \"Direct link to Options:\")\n\nOptions passed to `cypress open` will automatically be applied to the project you open. These persist on all projects until you quit Cypress. These options will also override values in the Cypress configuration file.\n\nBy passing `--browser` and `--e2e` or `--component` when launching a project, you can open Cypress and launch the browser at the same time. Otherwise, you will be guided through selecting a browser, project, and/or testing type.\n\n| Option | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `--browser`, `-b` | [Run Cypress in the browser with the given name.

Check out our troubleshooting guide](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/troubleshooting#Launching-browsers)\n\n#### `cypress open --config <config>`[​](#cypress-open-config-lt-config-gt \"Direct link to cypress-open-config-lt-config-gt\")\n\nSet [configuration](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration) values. Separate multiple values with a comma. The values set here override any values set in your configuration file.\n\n```\ncypress open --config pageLoadTimeout=100000,watchForFileChanges=false\n```\n\nFor more complex configuration objects, you may want to consider passing a [JSON.stringified](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify) object.\n\nHere, we're passing in the configuration for component spec files.\n\n```\ncypress open --config \"{\\\"watchForFileChanges\\\":false,\\\"specPattern\\\":[\\\"**/*.cy.js\\\",\\\"**/*.cy.ts\\\"]}\"\n```\n\n#### `cypress open --config-file <configuration-file>`[​](#cypress-open-config-file-lt-configuration-file-gt \"Direct link to cypress-open-config-file-lt-configuration-file-gt\")\n\nYou can specify a path to a file where [Cypress configuration](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration) values are set.\n\n```\ncypress open --config-file tests/cypress.config.js\n```\n\n#### `cypress open --env <env>`[​](#cypress-open-env-lt-env-gt \"Direct link to cypress-open-env-lt-env-gt\")\n\nSet Cypress [environment variables](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/environment-variables).\n\n```\ncypress open --env host=api.dev.local\n```\n\nPass several variables using commas and no spaces. Numbers are automatically converted from strings.\n\n```\ncypress open --env host=api.dev.local,port=4222\n```\n\nPass an object as a JSON in a string.\n\n```\ncypress open --env flags='{\"feature-a\":true,\"feature-b\":false}'\n```\n\n#### `cypress open --global`[​](#cypress-open-global \"Direct link to cypress-open-global\")\n\nOpening Cypress in global mode is useful if you have multiple nested projects but want to share a single global installation of Cypress. In this case you can add each nested project to the Cypress in global mode, thus giving you a nice UI to switch between them.\n\n#### `cypress open --port <port>`[​](#cypress-open-port-lt-port-gt \"Direct link to cypress-open-port-lt-port-gt\")\n\n#### `cypress open --project <project-path>`[​](#cypress-open-project-lt-project-path-gt \"Direct link to cypress-open-project-lt-project-path-gt\")\n\nTo see this in action we've set up an [example repo to demonstrate this here](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-test-nested-projects).\n\n```\ncypress open --project ./some/nested/folder\n```\n\n### `cypress info`[​](#cypress-info \"Direct link to cypress-info\")\n\nPrints information about Cypress and the current environment such as:\n\n*   A list of browsers Cypress detected on the machine.\n*   Any environment variables that control [proxy configuration](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/proxy-configuration).\n*   Any environment variables that start with the `CYPRESS` prefix (with sensitive variables like [record key](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/cloud/account-management/projects#Record-key) masked for security).\n*   The location where run-time data is stored.\n*   The location where the Cypress binary is cached.\n*   Operating system information.\n*   System memory including free space.\n\n```\ncypress infoDisplaying Cypress info...Detected 2 browsers installed:1.

    "markdown": "# Key Differences | Cypress Documentation\n\ninfo\n\n## What you'll learn[​](#What-youll-learn \"Direct link to What-youll-learn\")\n\n*   What makes Cypress unique\n*   How its architecture differs from Selenium\n*   New testing approaches not possible before\n\n## Architecture[​](#Architecture \"Direct link to Architecture\")\n\nMost testing tools (like Selenium) operate by running outside of the browser and executing remote commands across the network. _Cypress is the exact opposite._ Cypress is executed in the same run loop as your application.\n\nBehind Cypress is a Node server process. Cypress and the Node process constantly communicate, synchronize, and perform tasks on behalf of each other. Having access to both parts (front and back) gives us the ability to respond to your application's events in real time, while at the same time work outside of the browser for tasks that require a higher privilege.\n\nCypress also operates at the network layer by reading and altering web traffic on the fly. This enables Cypress to not only modify everything coming in and out of the browser, but also to change code that may interfere with its ability to automate the browser.\n\nCypress ultimately controls the entire automation process from top to bottom, which puts it in the unique position of being able to understand everything happening in and outside of the browser. This means Cypress is capable of delivering more consistent results than any other testing tool.\n\nBecause Cypress is [installed locally](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress) on your machine, it can additionally tap into the operating system for automation tasks. This makes performing tasks such as [taking screenshots, recording videos](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/screenshots-and-videos), general [file system operations](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/exec) and [network operations](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/request) possible.\n\n## Native access[​](#Native-access \"Direct link to Native access\")\n\nBecause Cypress operates within your application, that means it has native access to every single object. Whether it is the `window`, the `document`, a DOM element, your application instance, a function, a timer, a service worker, or anything else - you have access to it in your Cypress tests. There is no object serialization, there is no over-the-wire protocol - you have access to everything. Your test code can access all the same objects that your application code can.\n\n## New kind of testing[​](#New-kind-of-testing \"Direct link to New kind of testing\")\n\nHaving ultimate control over your application, the network traffic, and native access to every host object unlocks a new way of testing that has never been possible before. Instead of being 'locked out' of your application and not being able to easily control it - Cypress instead lets you alter any aspect of how your application works. Instead of slow and expensive tests, such as creating the state required for a given situation, you can create these states artificially like you would in an unit test. For instance you can:\n\n*   [Stub](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/stub) the browser or your application's functions and force them to behave as needed in your test case.\n*   Expose data stores (like in Redux) so you can programmatically alter the state of your application directly from your test code.\n*   Test edge cases like 'empty views' by forcing your server to send empty responses.\n*   Test how your application responds to errors on your server by modifying response status codes to be 500.\n*   Modify DOM elements directly - like forcing hidden elements to be shown.\n*   Use 3rd party plugins programmatically. Instead of fussing with complex UI widgets like multi selects, autocompletes, drop downs, tree views or calendars, you can call methods directly from your test code to control them.\n*   [Prevent Google Analytics from loading _before_ any of your application code executes](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration#blockHosts) when testing.\n*   Get synchronous notifications whenever your application transitions to a new page or when it begins to unload.\n*   [Control time by moving forward or backward](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/clock) so that timers or polls automatically fire without having to wait for the required time in your tests.\n*   Add your own event listeners to respond to your application. You could update your application code to behave differently when under tests in Cypress. You can control WebSocket messages from within Cypress, conditionally load 3rd party scripts, or call functions directly on your application.\n\n## Shortcuts[​](#Shortcuts \"Direct link to Shortcuts\")\n\nTrying to test hard to reach areas of your application? Don't like the side effects an action creates? Tired of repeating the same repetitive and slow actions over and over again? You can skip them for most test cases.\n\nCypress allows for browser context to be cached with [`cy.session()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/session). This means as a user, you only need to perform authentication once for the entirety of your test suite, and restore the saved session between each test. That means you do not have to visit a login page, type in a username and password and wait for the page to load and/or redirect for every test you run. You can accomplish this once with [`cy.session()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/session) and if needed, [`cy.origin()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/origin).\n\nCypress also gives you the ability to take shortcuts and programmatically log in. With commands like [`cy.request()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/request), you can send HTTP requests directly, yet have those requests synchronized with the browser. Cookies are automatically sent and applied back. Worried about CORS? Don't be, it is completely bypassed. The power to choose when to test like a user and when to skip slow and repetitive parts is yours.\n\n## Flake resistant[​](#Flake-resistant \"Direct link to Flake resistant\")\n\nCypress knows and understands everything that happens in your application synchronously. It is notified the moment the page loads and the moment the page unloads. It is impossible for Cypress to miss elements when it fires events. Cypress even knows how fast an element is animating and will [wait for it to stop animating](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/interacting-with-elements#Animations). Additionally, it [automatically waits for elements to become visible](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/interacting-with-elements#Visibility), to [become enabled](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/interacting-with-elements#Disability), and to [stop being covered](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/interacting-with-elements#Covering). When pages begin to transition, Cypress will pause command execution until the following page is fully loaded. You can even tell Cypress to [wait](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/wait) on specific network requests to finish.\n\nCypress executes the vast majority of its commands inside the browser, so there is no network lag. Commands execute and drive your application as fast as it is capable of rendering. To deal with modern JavaScript frameworks with complex UIs, you use assertions to tell Cypress what the desired state of your application should be. Cypress will automatically wait for your application to reach this state before moving on. You are completely insulated from fussing with manual waits or retries. Cypress automatically waits for elements to exist and will never yield you stale elements that have been detached from the DOM.\n\n## Debuggability[​](#Debuggability \"Direct link to Debuggability\")\n\nAbove all else Cypress has been built for usability.\n\nThere are hundreds of custom error messages describing the exact reason Cypress failed your test.\n\nThere is a rich UI which visually shows you the command execution, assertions, network requests, spies, stubs, page loads, or URL changes.\n\nCypress takes snapshots of your application and enables you to time travel back to the state it was in when commands ran.\n\nYou can use the Developer Tools while your tests run, you can see every console message, every network request. You can inspect elements, and you can even use debugger statements in your spec code or your application code. There is no fidelity loss - you can use all the tools you're already comfortable with. This enables you to test and develop all at the same time.\n\n## Trade offs[​](#Trade-offs \"Direct link to Trade offs\")\n\nWhile there are many new and powerful capabilities of Cypress - there are also important trade-offs that we've made in making this possible.\n\nIf you're interested in understanding more, we've written [an entire guide](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/trade-offs) on this topic.",

    "markdown": "# Content Security Policy | Cypress Documentation\n\nContent Security Policy (CSP) is a browser security feature that allows you to restrict the resources that can be loaded into your application. This can be problematic for Cypress, because it needs to inject JavaScript into your application in order to run tests and interact with the DOM. This page describes how Cypress handles CSP and how to configure it to work with your application.\n\nThere are two ways to implement CSP:\n\n*   [Meta tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta#http-equiv)\n*   [HTTP header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy)\n\nThe `<meta>` tag implementation is fully supported by Cypress without any configuration required. This is because Cypress loads the necessary `<script>` tags into your application before any `<meta>` tag is parsed. This prevents any CSP directives from being applied to the script loaded by Cypress.\n\nThe second implementation requires you to configure Cypress to allow the headers to be sent to your application. By default, Cypress will remove any CSP headers from the response before it is sent to the browser. This is done to prevent Cypress from being blocked by the browser's CSP implementation.\n\nFor most application tests, this should not cause any issues. However, if you are testing your application's CSP implementation, you will need to configure Cypress to allow the headers to be sent to the browser. You can do this by setting the [`experimentalCspAllowList`](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/experiments#Experimental-CSP-Allow-List) configuration option.\n\nFor more information on CSP, see the [Content Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) documentation on MDN.",

Those have lower priority, so they will only be used if the system properties are being resolved to not use a proxy.\n\ntip\n\n**Best Practice**\n\nThe recommended approach is to install Cypress with `npm` because:\n\n*   Cypress is versioned like any other dependency.\n*   It simplifies running Cypress in [Continuous Integration](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/continuous-integration/introduction).\n\n### `yarn add`[​](#yarn-add \"Direct link to yarn-add\")\n\nInstalling Cypress via [`Yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/):\n\nSystem proxy properties `http_proxy`, `https_proxy` and `no_proxy` are respected for the download of the Cypress binary.\n\n### `pnpm add`[​](#pnpm-add \"Direct link to pnpm-add\")\n\nInstalling Cypress via [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/):\n\n```\npnpm add --save-dev cypress\n```\n\ninfo\n\nYou need to make sure that you have the `pnpm` environment installed locally. If not you need to install it: `npm install pnpm@latest --global`.\n\n### Direct download[​](#Direct-download \"Direct link to Direct-download\")\n\nIf you're not using Node or a package manager (`npm`, `pnpm` or `Yarn`) in your project or you want to try Cypress out quickly, you can always [download Cypress directly from our CDN](https://download.cypress.io/desktop).\n\ncaution\n\nRecording runs to Cypress Cloud is not possible from the direct download. This download is only intended as a quick way to try out Cypress. To record tests to Cypress Cloud, you'll need to install Cypress as an `npm` dependency.\n\nThe direct download will always grab the latest available version. Your platform will be detected automatically.\n\nThen you can manually unzip and double click. Cypress will run without needing to install any dependencies.\n\n### Advanced Installation[​](#Advanced-Installation \"Direct link to Advanced-Installation\")\n\nIf you have more complex requirements, want to level-up your Cypress workflow or just need help with troubleshooting, check out our [Advanced Installation](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/advanced-installation) reference.\n\n### Continuous integration[​](#Continuous-integration \"Direct link to Continuous-integration\")\n\nPlease read our [Continuous Integration](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/continuous-integration/introduction) docs for help installing Cypress in CI. When running in Linux you may need to install some [system dependencies](#Linux-Prerequisites) or you can use our [Docker images](#Docker-Prerequisites) which have everything you need prebuilt.\n\n## System requirements[​](#System-requirements \"Direct link to System requirements\")\n\n### Operating System[​](#Operating-System \"Direct link to Operating System\")\n\nCypress is a desktop application that is installed on your computer. The desktop application supports these operating systems:\n\n*   **macOS** 10.15 and above _(Intel or Apple Silicon 64-bit (x64 or arm64))_\n*   **Linux** Ubuntu 20.04 and above, Fedora 38 and above, and Debian 10 and above _(x64 or arm64)_ (see [Linux Prerequisites](#Linux-Prerequisites) down below)\n*   **Windows** 10 and above _(64-bit only)_\n\n### Node.js[​](#Nodejs \"Direct link to Node.js\")\n\nCypress requires Node.js in order to install. We support the versions listed below:\n\n*   **Node.js** 18.x, 20.x, 22.x and above\n\nCypress generally aligns with [Node's release schedule](https://github.com/nodejs/Release).\n\n### Hardware[​](#Hardware \"Direct link to Hardware\")\n\nWhen running Cypress locally, it should run comfortably on any machine that is capable of modern web development.\n\nWhen running Cypress in CI, however, some of the lower-tier configurations might not be able to run Cypress reliably, especially when recording videos or doing longer test runs.\n\nSome issues you might run into in CI that could be a sign of insufficient resources are:\n\n*   Exiting early during `cypress run` or abruptly closing (“crashing”)\n*   Frozen or missing frames in the video that is captured\n*   Increased runtime\n\nWhen running Cypress in CI, we recommend that you have the following hardware requirements:\n\n#### CPU[​](#CPU \"Direct link to CPU\")\n\n*   2 CPUs minimum to run Cypress\n*   1 additional CPU if video recording is enabled\n*   1 additional CPU per process you run outside of Cypress, such as:\n    *   App server (frontend)\n    *   App server (backend)\n    *   App database\n    *   Any additional infrastructure (Redis, Kafka, etc..)\n\n### Memory[​](#Memory \"Direct link to Memory\")\n\n*   4GB minimum, 8GB+ for longer test runs\n\n### Linux Prerequisites[​](#Linux-Prerequisites \"Direct link to Linux Prerequisites\")\n\nIf you're using Linux, you'll want to have the required dependencies installed on your system. Depending on your system defaults, these dependencies may already be installed. If not, run the command line for your operating system listed below. See below under [Docker Prerequisites](#Docker-Prerequisites) for information on [Cypress Docker images](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-docker-images). These already include the necessary dependencies.\n\n#### Ubuntu/Debian[​](#UbuntuDebian \"Direct link to Ubuntu/Debian\")\n\n```\napt-get install libgtk2.0-0 libgtk-3-0 libgbm-dev libnotify-dev libnss3 libxss1 libasound2 libxtst6 xauth xvfb\n```\n\nFor Ubuntu 24.04 use the following command:\n\n```\napt-get install libgtk2.0-0t64 libgtk-3-0t64 libgbm-dev libnotify-dev libnss3 libxss1 libasound2t64 libxtst6 xauth xvfb\n```\n\n#### Arch[​](#Arch \"Direct link to Arch\")\n\n```\npacman -S gtk2 gtk3 alsa-lib xorg-server-xvfb libxss nss libnotify\n```\n\n#### Amazon Linux 2023[​](#Amazon-Linux-2023 \"Direct link to Amazon Linux 2023\")\n\n```\ndnf install -y xorg-x11-server-Xvfb gtk3-devel nss alsa-lib\n```\n\n### Docker Prerequisites[​](#Docker-Prerequisites \"Direct link to Docker Prerequisites\")\n\n[Cypress Docker images](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/continuous-integration/introduction#Cypress-Docker-variants) are available from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/cypress) and the [Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry) Public Gallery](https://gallery.ecr.aws/cypress-io). These images, which are Linux (Debian) based, include all of the required dependencies pre-installed.\n\nIf you need Node.js, browser or Cypress version combinations which are not covered by the published Cypress Docker images, then the [cypress/factory](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-docker-images/tree/master/factory) image allows you to generate your own customized Docker image easily.\n\nIf you are not using a Cypress Docker image, make sure that your base operating system is a Linux system listed in the supported [Operating Systems](#Operating-System) above and that Node.js is installed in the image. It is recommended to have `unzip` installed. This avoids the Cypress binary installation falling back to a slower unzip method using Node.js.\n\n## Next Steps[​](#Next-Steps \"Direct link to Next Steps\")\n\n[Open the app](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/opening-the-app) and take it for a test drive!",

    "markdown": "# Bundled Libraries | Cypress Documentation\n\ninfo\n\nCypress relies on many best-of-breed open source testing libraries to lend stability and familiarity to the platform from the get-go. If you've been testing in JavaScript, you'll recognize many old friends in this list. Understand how we exploit them and hit the ground running with Cypress!\n\n## Mocha[​](#Mocha \"Direct link to Mocha\")\n\n[http://mochajs.org/](http://mochajs.org/)\n\nCypress has adopted Mocha's `bdd` syntax, which fits perfectly with both integration and unit testing. All of the tests you'll be writing sit on the fundamental harness Mocha provides, namely:\n\n*   [`describe()`](http://mochajs.org/#bdd)\n*   [`context()`](http://mochajs.org/#bdd)\n*   [`it()`](http://mochajs.org/#bdd)\n*   [`before()`](http://mochajs.org/#hooks)\n*   [`beforeEach()`](http://mochajs.org/#hooks)\n*   [`afterEach()`](http://mochajs.org/#hooks)\n*   [`after()`](http://mochajs.org/#hooks)\n*   [`.only()`](http://mochajs.org/#exclusive-tests)\n*   [`.skip()`](http://mochajs.org/#exclusive-tests)\n\nAdditionally, Mocha gives us excellent [`async` support](http://mochajs.org/#asynchronous-code). Cypress has extended Mocha, sanding off the rough edges, weird edge cases, bugs, and error messages. These fixes are all completely transparent.\n\n## Chai[​](#Chai \"Direct link to Chai\")\n\n[http://chaijs.com/](http://chaijs.com/)\n\nWhile Mocha provides us a framework to structure our tests, Chai gives us the ability to easily write assertions. Chai gives us readable assertions with excellent error messages. Cypress extends this, fixes several common pitfalls, and wraps Chai's DSL using [subjects](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/introduction-to-cypress#Assertions) and the [`.should()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/should) command.\n\n## Chai-jQuery[​](#Chai-jQuery \"Direct link to Chai-jQuery\")\n\n[https://github.com/chaijs/chai-jquery](https://github.com/chaijs/chai-jquery)\n\nWhen writing integration tests, you will likely work a lot with the DOM. Cypress brings in Chai-jQuery, which automatically extends Chai with specific jQuery chainer methods.\n\n## Sinon.js[​](#Sinonjs \"Direct link to Sinon.js\")\n\n[https://github.com/sinonjs/sinon](https://github.com/sinonjs/sinon)\n\nWhen writing unit tests, or even in integration-like tests, you often need to ability to stub and spy methods. Cypress includes two methods, [`cy.stub()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/stub) and [`cy.spy()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/spy) that return Sinon stubs and spies, respectively.\n\nCypress also exposes a utility so that `sinon` can be called anywhere inside of your tests using [`Cypress.sinon`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/utilities/sinon).\n\n## Sinon-Chai[​](#Sinon-Chai \"Direct link to Sinon-Chai\")\n\n[https://github.com/cypress-io/sinon-chai](https://github.com/cypress-io/sinon-chai)\n\nWhen working with `stubs` or `spies` you'll regularly want to use those when writing Chai assertions. Cypress bundles in Sinon-Chai which extends Chai allowing you to [write assertions](https://github.com/cypress-io/sinon-chai) about `stubs` and `spies`.\n\n## Other Library Utilities[​](#Other-Library-Utilities \"Direct link to Other Library Utilities\")\n\nCypress also bundles the following tools on the `Cypress` object. These can be used anywhere inside of your tests.\n\n*   [`Cypress._`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/utilities/_) (lodash)\n*   [`Cypress.$`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/utilities/$) (jQuery)\n*   [`Cypress.minimatch`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/utilities/minimatch) (minimatch.js)\n*   [`Cypress.Blob`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/utilities/blob) (Blob utils)\n*   [`Cypress.Buffer`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/utilities/buffer) (Buffer utils)\n*   [`Cypress.Promise`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/utilities/promise) (Bluebird)",

    "markdown": "# Cross Browser Testing | Cypress Documentation\n\nCypress has the capability to run tests across multiple browsers. Currently, Cypress has support for [Chrome-family browsers](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/launching-browsers#Chrome-Browsers) (including Electron and Chromium-based Microsoft Edge), [WebKit](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/launching-browsers#WebKit-Experimental) (Safari's browser engine), and Firefox.\n\nExcluding [Electron](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/launching-browsers#Electron-Browser), any browser you want to run Cypress tests in needs to be installed on your local system or CI environment. A full list of detected browsers is displayed within the browser selection menu of [Cypress](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/cypress-app).\n\n![Cypress with Firefox selected as the browser](https://docs.cypress.io/img/guides/cross-browser-testing/v10/browser-select-FF.png)\n\nThe desired browser can also specified via the [`--browser`](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line#Options) flag when using [`run`](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-run) command to launch Cypress. For example, to run Cypress tests in Firefox:\n\n```\ncypress run --browser firefox\n```\n\nTo make launching of Cypress with a specific browser even more convenient, npm scripts can be used as a shortcut:\n\n```\n\"scripts\": {  \"cy:run:chrome\": \"cypress run --browser chrome\",  \"cy:run:firefox\": \"cypress run --browser firefox\"}\n```\n\n## Continuous Integration Strategies[​](#Continuous-Integration-Strategies \"Direct link to Continuous Integration Strategies\")\n\nWhen incorporating testing of multiple browsers within your QA process, you must implement a CI strategy that provides an optimal level of confidence while taking into consideration test duration and infrastructure costs. This optimal strategy will vary by the type and needs of a particular project. This guide we present several strategies to consider when crafting the strategy for your project.\n\nCI strategies will be demonstrated using the [Circle CI Cypress Orb](https://circleci.com/orbs/registry/orb/cypress-io/cypress) for its concise and readable configuration, but the same concepts apply for most CI providers.\n\ninfo\n\n**Docker Images for Testing**\n\nThe CI configuration examples within this guide use [Cypress's Docker images](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-docker-images/tree/master/browsers) to provision testing environments with desired versions of Node, Chrome, and Firefox.\n\n### Periodic Basis[​](#Periodic-Basis \"Direct link to Periodic Basis\")\n\nGenerally, it is desired to run tests with each pushed commit, but it may not be necessary to do so for all browsers. For example, we can choose to run tests within Chrome for each commit, but only run Firefox on a periodic basis (i.e. nightly). The periodic frequency will depend on the scheduling of your project releases, so consider a test run frequency that is appropriate for the release schedule of your project.\n\ninfo\n\n**Cron Scheduling**\n\nTypically CI providers allow for the scheduling of CI jobs via [cron expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron). For example, the expression `0 0 * * *` translates to \"everyday at midnight\" or nightly. Helpful [online utilities](https://crontab.guru/) are available to assist with creation and translation of cron expressions.\n\nThe following example demonstrates a nightly CI schedule against production (`master` branch) for Firefox:\n\n```\nversion: 2.1orbs:  cypress: cypress-io/cypress@3workflows:  nightly:    triggers:      - schedule:          cron: '0 0 * * *'          filters:            branches:              only:                - master    jobs:      - cypress/run:          install-browsers: true          cypress-command: 'npx cypress run --browser firefox'          start-command: 'npm start'\n```\n\n### Production Deployment[​](#Production-Deployment \"Direct link to Production Deployment\")\n\nFor projects that exhibit consistently stable behavior across browsers, it may be better to run tests against additional browsers only before merging changes in the production deployment branch.\n\nThe following example demonstrates only running Firefox tests when commits are merged into a specific branch (`develop` branch in this case) so any potential Firefox issues can be caught before a production release:\n\n```\nversion: 2.1orbs:  cypress: cypress-io/cypress@3workflows:  test_develop:    jobs:      - filters:        branches:          only:            - develop      - cypress/run:          install-browsers: true          cypress-command: 'npx cypress run --browser firefox'          start-command: 'npm start'\n```\n\n### Subset of Tests[​](#Subset-of-Tests \"Direct link to Subset of Tests\")\n\nWe can choose to only run a subset of tests against a given browser. For example, we can execute only the happy or critical path related test files, or a directory of specific \"smoke\" test files. It is not always necessary to have both browsers always running _all_ tests.\n\nIn the example below, the Chrome `cypress/run` job runs _all_ tests against Chrome and reports results to [Cypress Cloud](https://on.cypress.io/cloud) using a ([group](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/cloud/smart-orchestration/parallelization#Grouping-test-runs)) named `chrome`.\n\nThe Firefox `cypress/run` job runs a subset of tests, defined in the `spec` parameter, against the Firefox browser, and reports the results to [Cypress Cloud](https://on.cypress.io/cloud) under the group `firefox-critical-path`.\n\ninfo\n\n**Note:** The `name` under each `cypress/run` job which will be shown in the Circle CI workflow UI to distinguish the jobs.\n\n```\nversion: 2.1orbs:  cypress: cypress-io/cypress@3workflows:  build:    jobs:      - cypress/run:          name: Chrome          start-command: 'npm start'          install-browsers: true          cypress-command: 'npx cypress run --browser chrome --record --group chrome'      - cypress/run:          name: Firefox          start-command: 'npm start'          cypress-command: 'npx cypress run --browser firefox --record --group            firefox-critical-path --spec            cypress/e2e/signup.cy.js,cypress/e2e/login.cy.js'\n```\n\n### Parallelize per browser[​](#Parallelize-per-browser \"Direct link to Parallelize per browser\")\n\nExecution of test files can be parallelized on a per [group](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/cloud/smart-orchestration/parallelization#Grouping-test-runs) basis, where test files can be grouped by the browser under test. This versatility enables the ability to allocate the desired amount of CI resources towards a browser to either improve test duration or to minimize CI costs.\n\n**You do not have to run all browsers at the same parallelization level.** In the example below, the Chrome dedicated `cypress/run` job runs _all_ tests in parallel, across **4 machines**, against Chrome and reports results to [Cypress Cloud](https://on.cypress.io/cloud) under the group name `chrome`. The Firefox dedicated `cypress/run` job runs a _subset_ of tests in parallel, across **2 machines**, defined by the `spec` parameter, against the Firefox browser and reports results to [Cypress Cloud](https://on.cypress.io/cloud) under the group named `firefox`.\n\n```\nversion: 2.1orbs:  cypress: cypress-io/cypress@3workflows:  build:    jobs:      - cypress/run:          name: Chrome          cypress-command: 'npx cypress run --record --parallel --group chrome --browser chrome'          start-command: 'npm start'          parallelism: 4          install-browsers: true      - cypress/run:          name: Firefox          cypress-command:            'npx cypress run --record --parallel --group firefox --browser            firefox --spec            cypress/e2e/app.cy.js,cypress/e2e/login.cy.js,cypress/e2e/about.cy.js'          start-command: 'npm start'          parallelism: 2          install-browsers: true\n```\n\n### Running Specific Tests by Browser[​](#Running-Specific-Tests-by-Browser \"Direct link to Running Specific Tests by Browser\")\n\nThere may be instances where it can be useful to run or ignore one or more tests when in specific browsers. For example, test run duration can be reduced by only running smoke-tests against Chrome and not Firefox. This type of granular selection of test execution depends on the type of tests and the level of confidence those specific tests provide to the overall project.\n\ntip\n\n**Tip**\n\nWhen considering to ignore or only run a particular test within a given browser, assess the true need for the test to run on multiple browsers.\n\nYou can specify a browser to run or exclude by passing a matcher to the suite or test within the [test configuration](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration#Test-Configuration). The `browser` option accepts the same arguments as [Cypress.isBrowser()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/cypress-api/isbrowser#Arguments).\n\n```\n// Run the test if Cypress is running// using the built-in Electron browserit('has access to clipboard', { browser: 'electron' }, () => {  ...})// Run the test if Cypress is run via Firefoxit('Download extension in Firefox', { browser: 'firefox' }, () => {  cy.get('#dl-extension')    .should('contain', 'Download Firefox Extension')})// Run happy path tests if Cypress is run via Firefoxdescribe('happy path suite', { browser: 'firefox' }, () => {  it('...')  it('...')  it('...')})// Ignore test if Cypress is running via Chrome// This test is not recorded to Cypress Cloudit('Show warning outside Chrome', { browser: '!chrome' }, () => {  cy.get('.browser-warning').should(    'contain',    'For optimal viewing, use Chrome browser'  )})\n```\n\n## See also[​](#See-also \"Direct link to See also\")\n\n*   [Browser Launch API](https://docs.cypress.io/api/plugins/browser-launch-api)\n*   [Cypress.browser](https://docs.cypress.io/api/cypress-api/browser)\n*   [Cypress.isBrowser](https://docs.cypress.io/api/cypress-api/isbrowser)\n*   [Launching Browsers](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/launching-browsers)\n*   [Test Configuration](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration#Test-Configuration)",

    "markdown": "# Cross Origin Testing | Cypress Documentation\n\ninfo\n\nAs of Cypress [v12.0.0](https://on.cypress.io/changelog#12-0-0), Cypress has the capability to visit multiple origins in a single test via the [cy.origin()](https://on.cypress.io/origin) command!\n\nCypress limits each test to visiting domains that share the same superdomain. If a navigation occurs that does not meet the same superdomain rule, the [`cy.origin()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/origin) command must be used to execute Cypress commands inside the newly navigated origin.\n\nBut what is same superdomain? It is actually very similar to that of same origin! Two URLs have the same origin if the protocol, port (if specified), and host match. Cypress automatically handles hosts of the same superdomain by injecting the [`document.domain`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/domain) property into the visited `text/html` pages. This is why navigations without the use of the [`cy.origin()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/origin) command are solely scope to the same superdomain.\n\ncaution\n\n**Disabling document.domain Injection**\n\nIn some cases, `document.domain` injection may cause issues. As of Cypress [v12.4.0](https://on.cypress.io/changelog#12-4-0), disabling `document.domain` injection is available with the `experimentalSkipDomainInjection` option. Please read about this [experiment](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/experiments#Experimental-Skip-Domain-Injection) for more information\n\nWe understand this is a bit complicated to understand, so we have built a nifty chart to help clarify the differences!\n\n### Parts of a URL[​](#Parts-of-a-URL \"Direct link to Parts of a URL\")\n\n![](https://docs.cypress.io/img/guides/cross-origin-testing/parts_of_a_url.jpg)\n\nGiven the URLs below, all have the same superdomain compared to `https://www.cypress.io`.\n\n*   `https://cypress.io`\n*   `https://docs.cypress.io`\n*   `https://example.cypress.io/commands/querying`\n\nThe URLs below, however, will have different superdomains/origins compared to `https://www.cypress.io`.\n\n*   `http://www.cypress.io` (Different protocol)\n*   `https://docs.cypress.io:81` (Different port)\n*   `https://www.auth0.com/` (Different host of different superdomain)\n\nThe `http://localhost` URLs differ if their ports are different. For example, the `http://localhost:3000` URL is considered to be a different origin from the `http://localhost:8080` URL.\n\nThe rules are:\n\n*   You **cannot** [visit](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/visit) two domains of different superdomains in the same test and continue to interact with the page without the use of the [`cy.origin()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/origin) command.\n*   You **can** [visit](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/visit) two or more domains of different origin in **different** tests without needing [`cy.origin()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/origin).\n\nFor practical purposes, this means the following:\n\n```\n// This test will run without errorit('navigates', () => {  cy.visit('https://www.cypress.io')  cy.visit('https://docs.cypress.io')  cy.get('selector') // yup all good})\n```\n\n```\n// this will error because cypress-dx.com doesn't match the cypress.io superdomainit('navigates', () => {  cy.visit('https://www.cypress.io')  cy.visit('https://www.cypress-dx.com')  cy.get('selector')})\n```\n\nTo fix the above cross-origin error, use `cy.origin()` to indicate which origin the sequential command should run against:\n\n```\nit('navigates', () => {  cy.visit('https://example.cypress.io')  cy.visit('https://www.cypress-dx.com')  cy.origin('https://www.cypress-dx.com', () => {    cy.get('selector') // yup all good  })})\n```\n\n```\nit('navigates', () => {  cy.visit('https://www.cypress.io')})// split visiting different origin in another testit('navigates to new origin', () => {  cy.visit('https://cypress-dx.com')  cy.get('selector') // yup all good})\n```\n\nThis limitation exists because Cypress switches to the domain under each specific test when it runs. For more information on this, please see our Web Security page regarding [Different superdomain per test requires cy.origin command](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/web-security#Different-superdomain-per-test-requires-cyorigin-command).\n\n#### Other workarounds[​](#Other-workarounds \"Direct link to Other workarounds\")\n\nThere are other ways of testing the interaction between two superdomains. The browser has a natural security barrier called `origin policy` this means that state like `localStorage`, `cookies`, `service workers` and many other APIs are not shared between them anyways. Cypress does offer APIs around `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`, and `cookies` that are not limited to this restriction.\n\nAs a best practice, you should not visit or interact with any website not under your control.\n\nIf your organization uses Single Sign On (SSO) or OAuth then you might choose to test a 3rd party service other than your superdomain, which can be tested with [`cy.origin()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/origin).\n\nWe've written several other guides specifically about handling this situation.\n\n*   [Best Practices: Visiting external sites](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/best-practices#Visiting-External-Sites)\n*   [Web Security: Common Workarounds](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/web-security#Common-Workarounds)\n*   [Recipes: Logging In - Single Sign On](https://docs.cypress.io/examples/recipes#Logging-In)\n*   [Guides: Amazon Cognito Authentication](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/end-to-end-testing/amazon-cognito-authentication)\n*   [Guides: Auth0 Authentication](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/end-to-end-testing/auth0-authentication)\n*   [Guides: Okta Authentication](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/end-to-end-testing/okta-authentication)",

When running commands on the Cypress binary (e.g. `yarn cypress verify`), Yarn will reference the script of the same name instead and [Cypress CLI commands](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line) may not work as expected. Use instead a descriptive and non-ambiguous script name such as `cy:open` or `cy:run`.\n\n### CLI tools[​](#CLI-tools \"Direct link to CLI tools\")\n\nBy installing Cypress through `npm` you also get access to many other CLI commands. On top of that, Cypress is also a fully baked JavaScript library you can import into your Node scripts.\n\nYou can [read more about the CLI here](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line).\n\n## The Launchpad[​](#The-Launchpad \"Direct link to The Launchpad\")\n\n![The Launchpad window](https://docs.cypress.io/img/guides/core-concepts/cypress-app/the-launchpad.png)\n\nOn opening Cypress, your testing journey begins with the Launchpad. Its job is to guide you through the decisions and configuration tasks you need to complete before you start writing your first test.\n\nIf this is your first time using Cypress it will take you through the following steps in order.\n\n### Choosing a Testing Type[​](#Choosing-a-Testing-Type \"Direct link to Choosing a Testing Type\")\n\n![The Launchpad test type selector](https://docs.cypress.io/img/guides/getting-started/opening-the-app/choose-testing-type.png)\n\nThe Launchpad presents you with your biggest decision first: What type of testing shall I do? [E2E Testing](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/testing-types#What-is-E2E-Testing), where I run my whole application and visit pages to test them? Or [Component Testing](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/testing-types#What-is-Component-Testing), where I mount individual components of my app and test them in isolation?\n\nFor more background on this critical decision, read [Testing Types](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/testing-types). Alternatively, if you're not sure which type you want and just want to get on with your testing journey, just choose **E2E** for now - you can always change this later!\n\n### Quick Configuration[​](#Quick-Configuration \"Direct link to Quick Configuration\")\n\n![The Launchpad scaffolded files list](https://docs.cypress.io/img/guides/getting-started/opening-the-app/scaffolded-files.png)\n\nOn the next step, the Launchpad will scaffold out a set of configuration files appropriate to your chosen testing type, and the changes will be listed for you to review. For more information about the generated config check out the [Cypress configuration reference](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration), or you can just scroll down and hit \"Continue\".\n\n### Launching a Browser[​](#Launching-a-Browser \"Direct link to Launching a Browser\")\n\n![The Launchpad browser selector](https://docs.cypress.io/img/guides/getting-started/opening-the-app/select-browser.png)\n\nLastly, you're presented with the list of compatible browsers Cypress found on your system. To understand more about your options here, see [our guide on launching browsers](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/launching-browsers). Again, don't sweat it, you can switch browsers whenever you want. Now **MASH THAT START BUTTON!**\n\n## Next Steps[​](#Next-Steps \"Direct link to Next Steps\")\n\nTime to get testing!

We're going to do this with the **Create new empty spec** button.\n\n![Cypress with the Create new empty spec button highlighted](https://docs.cypress.io/img/guides/end-to-end-testing/writing-your-first-end-to-end-test/create-new-spec.png)\n\nOn clicking it, you should see a dialog where you can enter the name of your new spec.

Cypress monitors your spec files for any changes and automatically displays any changes.\n\n![Cypress showing the spec list with the newly created spec](https://docs.cypress.io/img/guides/end-to-end-testing/writing-your-first-end-to-end-test/spec-list-with-new-spec.png)\n\nEven though we haven't written any code yet - that's okay - let's click on your new spec and watch Cypress launch it. Cypress with visit `https://example.cypress.io` and the test passes.\n\n![Cypress showing the newly created spec passing](https://docs.cypress.io/img/guides/end-to-end-testing/writing-your-first-end-to-end-test/new-spec-test-run.png)\n\n## Write your first test[​](#Write-your-first-test \"Direct link to Write your first test\")\n\nNow it's time to write your first test. We're going to:\n\n1.  Write your first passing test.\n2.  Update it so it fails.\n3.  Watch Cypress reload in real time.\n\nOpen up your favorite IDE and replace the contents of your spec with the code below.\n\n```\ndescribe('My First Test', () => {  it('Does not do much!', () => {    expect(true).to.equal(true)  })})\n```\n\nOnce you save this change you should see the browser reload.\n\nAlthough it doesn't do anything useful, this is our first passing test! ✅\n\nOver in the [Command Log](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/cypress-app#Command-Log) you'll see Cypress display the suite, the test and your first assertion (which should be passing in green).\n\n![My first test shown passing in Cypress](https://docs.cypress.io/img/guides/getting-started/e2e/v10/first-test.png)\n\ninfo\n\nNotice Cypress displays a message about this being the default page [on the righthand side](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/cypress-app#Application-Under-Test). Cypress assumes you'll want to go out and [visit](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/visit) a URL on the internet - but it can also work just fine without that.\n\nNow let's write our first failing test.\n\n```\ndescribe('My First Test', () => {  it('Does not do much!', () => {    expect(true).to.equal(false)  })})\n```\n\nOnce you save again, you'll see Cypress display the failing test in red since `true` does not equal `false`.\n\nCypress also displays the stack trace and the code frame where the assertion failed (when available). You can click on the blue file link to open the file where the error occurred in [your preferred file opener](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/tooling/IDE-integration#File-Opener-Preference). To read more about the error's display, read about [Debugging Errors](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/debugging#Errors).\n\n![Failing test](https://docs.cypress.io/img/guides/getting-started/e2e/v10/first-test-failing.png)\n\n[Cypress](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/cypress-app) gives you a visual structure of suites, tests, and assertions. Soon you'll also see commands, page events, network requests, and more.\n\ninfo\n\n**What are _describe_, _it_, and _expect_ ?**\n\nAll of these functions come from [Bundled Libraries](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/bundled-libraries) that Cypress bakes in.\n\n*   `describe` and `it` come from [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/)\n*   `expect` comes from [Chai](http://www.chaijs.com/)\n\nCypress builds on these popular tools and frameworks that you _hopefully_ already have some familiarity and knowledge of. If not, that's okay too.\n\n## Write a _real_ test[​](#Write-a-real-test \"Direct link to Write-a-real-test\")\n\n**A solid test generally covers 3 phases:**\n\n1.  Set up the application state.\n2.  Take an action.\n3.  Make an assertion about the resulting application state.\n\nYou might also see this phrased as \"Given, When, Then\", or \"Arrange, Act, Assert\". But the idea is: First you put the application into a specific state, then you take some action in the application that causes it to change, and finally you check the resulting application state.\n\nToday, we'll take a narrow view of these steps and map them cleanly to Cypress commands:\n\n1.  Visit a web page.\n2.  Query for an element.\n3.  Interact with that element.\n4.  Assert about the content on the page.\n\n### Step 1: Visit a page[​](#Step-1-Visit-a-page \"Direct link to Step-1-Visit-a-page\")\n\nFirst, let's visit a web page. We will visit our [Kitchen Sink](https://docs.cypress.io/examples/applications#Kitchen-Sink) application in this example so that you can try Cypress out without needing to worry about finding a page to test.\n\nWe can pass the URL we want to visit to [`cy.visit()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/visit). Let's replace our previous test with the one below that actually visits a page:\n\n```\ndescribe('My First Test', () => {  it('Visits the Kitchen Sink', () => {    cy.visit('https://example.cypress.io')  })})\n```\n\nSave the file and switch back over to the Cypress Test Runner. You might notice a few things:\n\n1.  The [Command Log](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/cypress-app#Command-Log) now shows the new `VISIT` action.\n2.  The Kitchen Sink application has been loaded into the [App Preview](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/cypress-app#Overview) pane.\n3.  The test is green, even though we made no assertions.\n4.  The `VISIT` displays a **blue pending state** until the page finishes loading.\n\nHad this request come back with a non `2xx` status code such as `404` or `500`, or if there was a JavaScript error in the application's code, the test would have failed.\n\ndanger\n\n**Testing Apps You Don't Control**\n\nIn this guide we are testing our example application: [`https://example.cypress.io`](https://example.cypress.io/). However you should think carefully about testing applications you **don't control**. Why?\n\n*   They have the potential to change at any moment which will break tests.\n*   They may do A/B testing which makes it impossible to get consistent results.\n*   They may detect you are a script and block your access.\n*   They may have security features enabled which prevent Cypress from working.\n\nGenerally speaking, the point of Cypress is to be a tool you use every day to build and test your own applications, not a general purpose web automation tool. However, this is a guideline rather than a hard-and-fast rule and there are a number of good reasons to make exceptions for certain kinds of application:\n\n*   They are specifically designed to integrate with third parties, e.g. SSO providers.\n*   They provide you with a complementary service, e.g. SaaS control panels or analytics.\n*   They reuse your content or provide plugins for an app you control.\n\nThe key here is to carefully weigh the benefits of the tests in question against the possible disruption and flake these sorts of tests can introduce.\n\n### Step 2: Query for an element[​](#Step-2-Query-for-an-element \"Direct link to Step-2-Query-for-an-element\")\n\nNow that we've got a page loaded, we need to take some action on it. Why don't we click a link on the page? Sounds easy enough, let's go look for one we like... how about `type`?\n\nTo find this element by its contents, we'll use [cy.contains()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/contains).\n\nLet's add it to our test and see what happens:\n\n```\ndescribe('My First Test', () => {  it('finds the content \"type\"', () => {    cy.visit('https://example.cypress.io')    cy.contains('type')  })})\n```\n\nOur test should now display `CONTAINS` in the [Command Log](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/cypress-app#Command-Log) and still be green.\n\nEven without adding an assertion, we know that everything is okay! This is because many of Cypress' commands are built to fail if they don't find what they're expecting to find. This is known as an [Implicit Assertion](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/introduction-to-cypress#Implicit-Assertions).\n\nTo verify this, replace `type` with something not on the page, like `hype`. You'll notice the test goes red, but only after about 4 seconds!\n\nCan you see what Cypress is doing under the hood? It's automatically waiting and retrying because it expects the content to **eventually** be found in the DOM. It doesn't immediately fail!\n\n![Test failing to not find content 'hype'](https://docs.cypress.io/img/guides/getting-started/e2e/v10/first-test-failing-contains.png)\n\ncaution\n\n**Error Messages**\n\nWe've taken care at Cypress to write hundreds of custom error messages that attempt to clearly explain what went wrong. In this case, Cypress **timed out retrying** to find the content `hype` within the entire page. To read more about the error's display, read about [Debugging Errors](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/debugging#Errors).\n\nBefore we add another command - let's get this test back to passing. Replace `hype` with `type`.\n\n### Step 3: Click an element[​](#Step-3-Click-an-element \"Direct link to Step-3-Click-an-element\")\n\nOk, now we want to click on the link we found. How do we do that? Add a [.click()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/click) command to the end of the previous command, like so:\n\n```\ndescribe('My First Test', () => {  it('clicks the link \"type\"', () => {    cy.visit('https://example.cypress.io')    cy.contains('type').click()  })})\n```\n\nYou can almost read it like a little story! Cypress calls this \"chaining\" and we chain together commands to build tests that really express what the app does in a declarative way.\n\nAlso note that the [App Preview](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/cypress-app#Overview) pane has updated further after the click, following the link and showing the destination page:\n\nNow we can assert something about this new page!\n\ninfo\n\n✨ IntelliSense is available in your Cypress spec files by adding a special triple slash comment line. Read about [Intelligent Code Completion](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/tooling/IDE-integration#Triple-slash-directives).\n\n### Step 4: Make an assertion[​](#Step-4-Make-an-assertion \"Direct link to Step-4-Make-an-assertion\")\n\nLet's make an assertion about something on the new page we clicked into. Perhaps we'd like to make sure the new URL is the expected URL. We can do that by looking up the URL and chaining an assertion to it with [.should()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/should).\n\nHere's what that looks like:\n\n```\ndescribe('My First Test', () => {  it('clicking \"type\" navigates to a new url', () => {    cy.visit('https://example.cypress.io')    cy.contains('type').click()    // Should be on a new URL which    // includes '/commands/actions'    cy.url().should('include', '/commands/actions')  })})\n```\n\n#### Adding more commands and assertions[​](#Adding-more-commands-and-assertions \"Direct link to Adding more commands and assertions\")\n\nWe are not limited to a single interaction and assertion in a given test. In fact, many interactions in an application may require multiple steps and are likely to change your application state in more than one way.\n\nWe can continue the interactions and assertions in this test by adding another chain to interact with and verify the behavior of elements on this new page.\n\nWe can use [cy.get()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/get) to select an element based on its class. Then we can use the [.type()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/type) command to enter text into the selected input. Finally, we can verify that the value of the input reflects the text that was typed with another [.should()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/should).\n\nIn general, the structure of your test should flow query -> query -> command or assertion(s). It's best practice not to chain anything after an action command; for more details on why this is, see our guide on [retry-ability](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/retry-ability).\n\n```\ndescribe('My First Test', () => {  it('Gets, types and asserts', () => {    cy.visit('https://example.cypress.io')    cy.contains('type').click()    // Should be on a new URL which    // includes '/commands/actions'    cy.url().should('include', '/commands/actions')    // Get an input, type into it    cy.get('.action-email').type('[email protected]')    //  Verify that the value has been updated    cy.get('.action-email').should('have.value', '[email protected]')  })})\n```\n\ncaution\n\nWe normally don't suggest selecting and finding elements by their class names, but we do so here since we are querying an external site, and sometimes that is all we have to work with.\n\nFor more information on our guidance on selector best practices, see our guide on it [here](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/best-practices#Selecting-Elements).\n\nAnd there you have it: a short test in Cypress that visits a page, finds and clicks a link, verifies the URL and then verifies the behavior of an element on the new page. If we read it out loud, it might sound like:\n\nnote\n\n1.  _Visit: `https://example.cypress.io`_\n2.  _Find the element with content: `type`_\n3.  _Click on it_\n4.  _Get the URL_\n5.  _Assert it includes: `/commands/actions`_\n6.  _Get the input with the `action-email` class_\n7.  _Type `[[email protected]](https://docs.cypress.io/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)` into the input_\n8.  _Assert the input reflects the new value_\n\nOr in the _Given_, _When_, _Then_ syntax:\n\nnote\n\n1.  _**Given** a user visits `https://example.cypress.io`_\n2.  _**When** they click the link labeled `type`_\n3.  _And they type \"[\\[email protected\\]](https://docs.cypress.io/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#5630373d3316333b373f3a7835393b)\" into the input that has a class of `action-email` input_\n4.  _**Then** the URL should include `/commands/actions`_\n5.  _And the `[data-testid=\"action-email\"]` input has \"[\\[email protected\\]](https://docs.cypress.io/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#096f68626c496c64686065276a6664)\" as its value_\n\nAnd hey, this is a very clean test! We didn't have to say anything about _how_ things work, just that we'd like to verify a particular series of events and outcomes.\n\ninfo\n\n**Page Transitions**\n\nWorth noting is that this test transitioned across two different pages.\n\n1.  The initial [cy.visit()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/visit)\n2.  The [.click()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/click) to a new page\n\nCypress automatically detects things like a `page transition event` and will automatically **halt** running commands until the next page has **finished** loading.\n\nHad the **next page** not finished its loading phase, Cypress would have ended the test and presented an error.\n\nUnder the hood - this means you don't have to worry about commands accidentally running against a stale page, nor do you have to worry about running commands against a partially loaded page.\n\nWe mentioned previously that Cypress waited **4 seconds** before timing out finding a DOM element - but in this case, when Cypress detects a `page transition event` it automatically increases the timeout to **60 seconds** for the single `PAGE LOAD` event.\n\nIn other words, based on the commands and the events happening, Cypress automatically alters its expected timeouts to match web application behavior.\n\nThese various timeouts are defined in the [Configuration](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration#Timeouts) document.\n\n## Record Tests with Cypress Studio[​](#Record-Tests-with-Cypress-Studio \"Direct link to Record Tests with Cypress Studio\")\n\nIf you want a minimal code approach to creating tests, you can use [Cypress Studio](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/cypress-studio) to record your browser interactions and generate tests.

This file is used to store any configuration specific to Cypress.\n\nCypress additionally supports config files with `.mjs` or `.cjs` extensions.\n\nUsing a `.mjs` file will allow you to use [ESM Module](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules) syntax in your config without the need of a transpiler step.\n\nA '.cjs' file uses the [CommonJS](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html) module syntax, which is the default for JavaScript files. All JavaScript config examples in our docs use the CommonJS format.\n\nIf you [configure your tests to record](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/cloud/getting-started#Setup) the results to [Cypress Cloud](https://on.cypress.io/cloud-introduction) the `projectId` will be stored in the config file as well.\n\n## Intelligent Code Completion[​](#Intelligent-Code-Completion \"Direct link to Intelligent Code Completion\")\n\nThe `defineConfig` helper function is exported by Cypress, and it provides automatic code completion for configuration in many popular code editors. While it's not strictly necessary for Cypress to parse your configuration, we recommend wrapping your config object with `defineConfig()` like this:\n\n*   cypress.config.js\n*   cypress.config.ts\n\n```\nconst { defineConfig } = require('cypress')module.exports = defineConfig({  e2e: {    baseUrl: 'http://localhost:1234',  },})\n```\n\n## Options[​](#Options \"Direct link to Options\")\n\nThe default behavior of Cypress can be modified by supplying any of the following configuration options. Below is a list of available options and their default values.\n\n### Global[​](#Global \"Direct link to Global\")\n\n| Option | Default | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `clientCertificates` | `[]` | An optional array of [client certificates](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/client-certificates). |\n| `env` | `{}` | Any values to be set as [environment variables](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/environment-variables). |\n| `includeShadowDom` | `false` | Whether to traverse shadow DOM boundaries and include elements within the shadow DOM in the results of query commands (e.g. [`cy.get()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/get)). |\n| `numTestsKeptInMemory` | Default based on `run` or `open` mode | The number of tests for which snapshots and command data are kept in memory. `numTestsKeptInMemory` is set to `50` by default during `cypress open` and set to `0` by default during `cypress run`. Reduce this number if you are experiencing high memory consumption in your browser during a test run. |\n| `port` | `null` | Port used to host Cypress. Normally this is a randomly generated port. |\n| `redirectionLimit` | `20` | The number of times that the application under test can redirect before erroring. |\n| `reporter` | `spec` | The [reporter](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/tooling/reporters) used during `cypress run`. |\n| `reporterOptions` | `null` | The [reporter options](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/tooling/reporters#Reporter-Options) used. Supported options depend on the reporter. |\n| `retries` | `{ \"runMode\": 0, \"openMode\": 0 }` | The number of times to retry a failing test. Can be configured to apply to `cypress run` or `cypress open` separately. As of Cypress `13.4.0`, the experimental Flake Detection strategy can also be configured. See [Test Retries](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/test-retries) for more information. |\n| `watchForFileChanges` | Default based on `run` or `open` mode | Whether Cypress will watch and restart tests on test file changes. `watchForFileChanges` is set to `true` by default during `cypress open` and set to `false` by default during `cypress run`. |\n\n### Timeouts[​](#Timeouts \"Direct link to Timeouts\")\n\n| Option | Default | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `defaultCommandTimeout` | `4000` | Time, in milliseconds, to wait until most DOM based commands are considered timed out. |\n| `execTimeout` | `60000` | Time, in milliseconds, to wait for a system command to finish executing during a [`cy.exec()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/exec) command. |\n| `taskTimeout` | `60000` | Time, in milliseconds, to wait for a task to finish executing during a [`cy.task()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/task) command. |\n| `pageLoadTimeout` | `60000` | Time, in milliseconds, to wait for `page transition events` or [`cy.visit()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/visit), [`cy.go()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/go), [`cy.reload()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/reload) commands to fire their page `load` events. Network requests are limited by the underlying operating system, and may still time out if this value is increased. |\n| `requestTimeout` | `5000` | Time, in milliseconds, to wait for a request to go out in a [`cy.wait()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/wait) command. |\n| `responseTimeout` | `30000` | Time, in milliseconds, to wait until a response in a [`cy.request()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/request), [`cy.wait()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/wait), [`cy.fixture()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/fixture), [`cy.getCookie()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/getcookie), [`cy.getCookies()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/getcookies), [`cy.setCookie()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/setcookie), [`cy.clearCookie()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/clearcookie), [`cy.clearCookies()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/clearcookies), and [`cy.screenshot()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/screenshot) commands. |\n\n### Folders / Files[​](#Folders--Files \"Direct link to Folders / Files\")\n\n| Option | Default | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `downloadsFolder` | `cypress/downloads` | Path to folder where files downloaded during a test are saved. |\n| `fileServerFolder` | root project folder | Path to folder where application files will attempt to be served from. |\n| `fixturesFolder` | `cypress/fixtures` | Path to folder containing fixture files (Pass `false` to disable). |\n| `screenshotsFolder` | `cypress/screenshots` | Path to folder where screenshots will be saved from [`cy.screenshot()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/screenshot) command or after a test fails during `cypress run`. |\n| `videosFolder` | `cypress/videos` | Path to folder where videos will be saved during `cypress run`. |\n\n### Screenshots[​](#Screenshots \"Direct link to Screenshots\")\n\n| Option | Default | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `screenshotOnRunFailure` | `true` | Whether Cypress will take a screenshot when a test fails during `cypress run`. |\n| `screenshotsFolder` | `cypress/screenshots` | Path to folder where screenshots will be saved from [`cy.screenshot()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/screenshot) command or after a test fails during `cypress run`. |\n| `trashAssetsBeforeRuns` | `true` | Whether Cypress will trash assets within the `downloadsFolder`, `screenshotsFolder`, and `videosFolder` before tests run with `cypress run`. |\n\nFor more options regarding screenshots, view the [Cypress.Screenshot API](https://docs.cypress.io/api/cypress-api/screenshot-api).\n\n### Videos[​](#Videos \"Direct link to Videos\")\n\n| Option | Default | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `trashAssetsBeforeRuns` | `true` | Whether Cypress will trash assets within the `downloadsFolder`, `screenshotsFolder`, and `videosFolder` before tests run with `cypress run`. |\n| `videoCompression` | `false` | The quality setting for the video compression, in Constant Rate Factor (CRF). The value can be `false` or `0` to disable compression or a CRF between `1` and `51`, where a lower value results in better quality (at the expense of a higher file size). Setting this option to `true` will result in a default CRF of `32`. |\n| `videosFolder` | `cypress/videos` | Where Cypress will automatically save the video of the test run when tests run with `cypress run`. |\n| `video` | `false` | Whether Cypress will capture a video of the tests run with `cypress run`. |\n\n### Downloads[​](#Downloads \"Direct link to Downloads\")\n\n| Option | Default | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `downloadsFolder` | `cypress/downloads` | Path to folder where files downloaded during a test are saved. |\n| `trashAssetsBeforeRuns` | `true` | Whether Cypress will trash assets within the `downloadsFolder`, `screenshotsFolder`, and `videosFolder` before tests run with `cypress run`. |\n\n### Browser[​](#Browser \"Direct link to Browser\")\n\n| Option | Default | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `chromeWebSecurity` | `true` | Whether to enable Chromium-based browser's Web Security for same-origin policy and insecure mixed content. |\n| `blockHosts` | `null` | A String or Array of hosts that you wish to block traffic for. [Please read the notes for examples on using this.](#blockHosts) |\n| `modifyObstructiveCode` | `true` | Whether Cypress will search for and replace obstructive JS code in `.js` or `.html` files. [Please read the notes for more information on this setting.](#modifyObstructiveCode) |\n| `userAgent` | `null` | Enables you to override the default user agent the browser sends in all request headers. User agent values are typically used by servers to help identify the operating system, browser, and browser version. See [User-Agent MDN Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/User-Agent) for example user agent values. |\n\n### Viewport[​](#Viewport \"Direct link to Viewport\")\n\n| Option | Default | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `viewportHeight` | `660` | Default height in pixels for the application under tests' viewport. (Override with [`cy.viewport()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/viewport) command) |\n| `viewportWidth` | `1000` | Default width in pixels for the application under tests' viewport. (Override with [`cy.viewport()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/viewport) command) |\n\n### Actionability[​](#Actionability \"Direct link to Actionability\")\n\n| Option | Default | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `animationDistanceThreshold` | `5` | The distance in pixels an element must exceed over time to be considered animating. |\n| `waitForAnimations` | `true` | Whether to wait for elements to finish animating before executing commands. |\n| `scrollBehavior` | `top` | Viewport position to which an element should be scrolled before executing commands. Can be `'center'`, `'top'`, `'bottom'`, `'nearest'`, or `false`. `false` disables scrolling. |\n\nFor more information, see the docs on [actionability](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/interacting-with-elements#Actionability).\n\n### Experiments[​](#Experiments \"Direct link to Experiments\")\n\nConfiguration might include experimental options currently being tested. See [Experiments](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/experiments) page.\n\n## Testing Type-Specific Options[​](#Testing-Type-Specific-Options \"Direct link to Testing Type-Specific Options\")\n\nYou can provide configuration options for either E2E or Component Testing by creating `e2e` and `component` objects inside your Cypress configuration.\n\n### e2e[​](#e2e \"Direct link to e2e\")\n\nThese options are available to be specified inside the `e2e` configuration object:\n\n| Option | Default | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `baseUrl` | `null` | URL used as prefix for [`cy.visit()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/visit) or [`cy.request()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/request) command's URL. |\n| `setupNodeEvents` | `null` | Function in which node events can be registered and config can be modified. Takes the place of the (removed) pluginFile option. [Please read the notes for examples on using this.](#setupNodeEvents) |\n| `supportFile` | `cypress/support/e2e.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}` | Path to file to load before spec files load. This file is compiled and bundled. (Pass `false` to disable) |\n| `specPattern` | `cypress/e2e/**/*.cy.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}` | A String or Array of glob patterns of the test files to load. |\n| `excludeSpecPattern` | `*.hot-update.js` | A String or Array of glob patterns used to ignore test files that would otherwise be shown in your list of tests. [Please read the notes on using this.](#excludeSpecPattern) |\n| `experimentalRunAllSpecs` | `false` | Enables the \"Run All Specs\" UI feature, allowing the execution of multiple specs sequentially. |\n| `slowTestThreshold` | `10000` | Time, in milliseconds, to consider a test \"slow\" during `cypress run`. A slow test will display in orange text in the default reporter. |\n| `testIsolation` | `true` | Whether or not [test isolation](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/writing-and-organizing-tests#Test-Isolation) is enabled to ensure a clean browser context between tests. |\n\n*   cypress.config.js\n*   cypress.config.ts\n\n```\nconst { defineConfig } = require('cypress')module.exports = defineConfig({  e2e: {    // e2e options here  },})\n```\n\n### component[​](#component \"Direct link to component\")\n\nThese options are available to be specified inside the `component` configuration object:\n\n| Option | Default | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `devServer` | `null` | Required option used to configure the component testing dev server. [Please read the notes for examples on using this.](#devServer) |\n| `indexHtmlFile` | `cypress/support/component-index.html` | This is where Cypress renders your components and allows you to add in global assets, such as styles, fonts, and external scripts. |\n| `setupNodeEvents` | `null` | Function in which node events can be registered and config can be modified. Takes the place of the (removed) plugins file. [Please read the notes for examples on using this.](#setupNodeEvents) |\n| `supportFile` | `cypress/support/component.js` | Path to file to load before spec files load. This file is compiled and bundled. (Pass `false` to disable) |\n| `specPattern` | `**/*.cy.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}` | A glob pattern String or Array of glob pattern Strings of the spec files to load.<br><br>Note that any files found matching the `e2e.specPattern` value will be automatically **excluded.** |\n| `excludeSpecPattern` | `['/snapshots/*', '/image_snapshots/*']` | A String or Array of glob patterns used to ignore spec files that would otherwise be shown in your list of specs. [Please read the notes on using this.](#excludeSpecPattern) |\n| `experimentalSingleTabRunMode` | `false` | Run all specs in a single tab, instead of creating a new tab per spec. This can improve run mode performance, but can impact spec isolation and reliability on large test suites. This experiment currently only applies to Component Testing. |\n| `slowTestThreshold` | `250` | Time, in milliseconds, to consider a test \"slow\" during `cypress run`. A slow test will display in orange text in the default reporter. |\n| `devServerPublicPathRoute` | `/__cypress/src` | The public path of the dev server in use. Use caution overriding the default value as it can have unintended consequences. See [Framework Configuration](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/component-testing/component-framework-configuration) or dev server specific documentation (in particular `@cypress/vite-dev-server`). |\n\n*   cypress.config.js\n*   cypress.config.ts\n\n```\nconst { defineConfig } = require('cypress')module.exports = defineConfig({  component: {    // component options here  },})\n```\n\n## Overriding Options[​](#Overriding-Options \"Direct link to Overriding Options\")\n\nCypress gives you the option to dynamically alter configuration options. This is helpful when running Cypress in multiple environments and on multiple developer machines.\n\n### Overriding Individual Options[​](#Overriding-Individual-Options \"Direct link to Overriding Individual Options\")\n\nWhen running Cypress from the command line you can pass a `--config` flag to override individual config options.\n\nFor example, to override `viewportWidth` and `viewportHeight`, you can run:\n\n```\ncypress run --browser firefox --config viewportWidth=1280,viewportHeight=720\n```\n\n### Specifying an Alternative Config File[​](#Specifying-an-Alternative-Config-File \"Direct link to Specifying an Alternative Config File\")\n\nIn the Cypress CLI, you can change which config file Cypress will use with the [`--config-file`](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-open-config-file-lt-configuration-file-gt) flag.\n\n```\ncypress run --config-file tests/cypress.config.js\n```\n\nSee the [Command Line](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line) guide for more examples.\n\n### Testing Type-Specific Overrides[​](#Testing-Type-Specific-Overrides \"Direct link to Testing Type-Specific Overrides\")\n\nIn addition to setting [Testing Type-Specific options](#Testing-Type-Specific-Options), you can override other configuration options for either the [E2E Testing](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/testing-types#What-is-E2E-Testing) or [Component Testing](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/testing-types#What-is-Component-Testing).\n\nFor example:\n\n*   cypress.config.js\n*   cypress.config.ts\n\n```\nconst { defineConfig } = require('cypress')module.exports = defineConfig({  // These settings apply everywhere unless overridden  defaultCommandTimeout: 5000,  viewportWidth: 1000,  viewportHeight: 600,  // Viewport settings overridden for component tests  component: {    viewportWidth: 500,    viewportHeight: 500,  },  // Command timeout overridden for E2E tests  e2e: {    defaultCommandTimeout: 10000,  },})\n```\n\n### Environment Variables[​](#Environment-Variables \"Direct link to Environment Variables\")\n\nConfiguration options can be overridden with [environment variables](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/environment-variables). This is especially useful in [Continuous Integration](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/continuous-integration/introduction) or when working locally. This gives you the ability to change configuration options without modifying any code or build scripts.\n\nFor example, these enviroment variables in the command line will override any `viewportWidth` or `viewportHeight` options set in the Cypress configuration:\n\n```\nexport CYPRESS_VIEWPORT_WIDTH=800export CYPRESS_VIEWPORT_HEIGHT=600\n```\n\nSee the [Environment Variables](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/environment-variables#Option-3-CYPRESS_) guide for more examples.\n\n## Test Configuration[​](#Test-Configuration \"Direct link to Test Configuration\")\n\nWe provide two options to override the configuration while your test are running, `Cypress.config()` and suite-specific or test-specific configuration overrides.\n\n⚠️ **Note:** The configuration values below are all writeable and **can be changed** via per test configuration. Any other configuration values are readonly and cannot be changed at run time.\n\n*   `animationDistanceThreshold`\n*   `baseUrl`\n*   `blockHosts`\n*   `defaultCommandTimeout`\n*   `env` **note:** Provided environment variables will be merged with current environment variables.\n*   `execTimeout`\n*   `includeShadowDom`\n*   `keystrokeDelay`\n*   `numTestsKeptInMemory`\n*   `pageLoadTimeout`\n*   `redirectionLimit`\n*   `requestTimeout`\n*   `responseTimeout`\n*   `retries`\n*   `screenshotOnRunFailure`\n*   `scrollBehavior`\n*   `slowTestThreshold`\n*   `taskTimeout`\n*   `testIsolation` - this option can only be overridden at the suite-specific override level\n*   `viewportHeight`\n*   `viewportWidth`\n*   `waitForAnimations`\n\n#### `Cypress.config()`[​](#Cypressconfig \"Direct link to Cypressconfig\")\n\nYou can also override configuration values within your test using [`Cypress.config()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/cypress-api/config).\n\nThis changes the configuration _for the remaining execution of the current spec file_. The values will reset to the previous default values after the spec has complete.\n\n```\nCypress.config('pageLoadTimeout', 100000)Cypress.config('pageLoadTimeout') // => 100000\n```\n\n#### Test-specific Configuration[​](#Test-specific-Configuration \"Direct link to Test-specific Configuration\")\n\nTo apply specific Cypress [configuration](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration) values to a suite or test, pass a configuration object to the test or suite function as the second argument.\n\nThe configuration values passed in will only take effect during the suite or test where they are set. The values will then reset to the previous default values after the suite or test is complete.\n\n##### Syntax[​](#Syntax \"Direct link to Syntax\")\n\n```\ndescribe(name, config, fn)context(name, config, fn)it(name, config, fn)specify(name, config, fn)\n```\n\n##### Suite configuration[​](#Suite-configuration \"Direct link to Suite configuration\")\n\nIf you want to target a suite of tests to run or be excluded when run in a specific browser, you can override the `browser` configuration within the suite configuration. The `browser` option accepts the same arguments as [`Cypress.isBrowser()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/cypress-api/isbrowser).\n\nYou can configure the number of times to retries a suite of tests if they fail during `cypress run` and `cypress open` separately.\n\n```\ndescribe(  'login',  {    retries: {      runMode: 3,      openMode: 2,    },  },  () => {    it('should redirect unauthenticated user to sign-in page', () => {      // ...    })    it('allows user to login', () => {      // ...    })  })\n```\n\n##### Single test configuration[​](#Single-test-configuration \"Direct link to Single test configuration\")\n\nIf you want to target a test to run or be excluded when run in a specific browser, you can override the `browser` configuration within the test configuration. The `browser` option accepts the same arguments as [Cypress.isBrowser()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/cypress-api/isbrowser).\n\n```\nit('Show warning outside Chrome', { browser: '!chrome' }, () => {  cy.get('.browser-warning').should(    'contain',    'For optimal viewing, use Chrome browser'  )})\n```\n\n## Resolved Configuration[​](#Resolved-Configuration \"Direct link to Resolved Configuration\")\n\nWhen you open a Cypress project, expanding the Project Settings panel under **Settings** will display the resolved configuration to you. This helps you to understand and see where different values came from. Each set value is highlighted to show where the value has been set via the following ways:\n\n*   Default value\n*   [Cypress configuration file](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration)\n*   The [Cypress environment file](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/environment-variables#Option-2-cypressenvjson)\n*   System [environment variables](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/environment-variables#Option-3-CYPRESS_)\n*   [Command Line arguments](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line)\n*   [setupNodeEvents](#setupNodeEvents)\n\n![See resolved configuration](https://docs.cypress.io/img/guides/configuration/v10/see-resolved-configuration.png)\n\n## Notes[​](#Notes \"Direct link to Notes\")\n\n### blockHosts[​](#blockHosts \"Direct link to blockHosts\")\n\nBy passing a string or array of strings you can block requests made to one or more hosts.\n\nTo block a host:\n\n*   ✅ Pass only the host\n*   ✅ Use wildcard `*` patterns\n*   ✅ Include the port other than `80` and `443`\n*   ❌ Do **NOT** include protocol: `http://` or `https://`\n\ninfo\n\nNot sure what a part of the URL a host is? [Use this guide as a reference.](https://nodejs.org/api/url.html#url_url_strings_and_url_objects)\n\nWhen blocking a host, we use [`minimatch`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/utilities/minimatch) to check the host. When in doubt you can test whether something matches yourself.\n\nGiven the following URLs:\n\n```\nhttps://www.google-analytics.com/ga.jshttp://localhost:1234/some/user.json\n```\n\nThis would match the following blocked hosts:\n\n```\nwww.google-analytics.com*.google-analytics.com*google-analytics.comlocalhost:1234\n```\n\nBecause `localhost:1234` uses a port other than `80` and `443` it **must be included**.\n\ncaution\n\n**Subdomains**\n\nBe cautious for URL's which have no subdomain.\n\nFor instance given a URL: `https://google.com/search?q=cypress`\n\n*   ✅ Matches `google.com`\n*   ✅ Matches `*google.com`\n*   ❌ Does NOT match `*.google.com`\n\nWhen Cypress blocks a request made to a matching host, it will automatically send a `503` status code. As a convenience it also sets a `x-cypress-matched-blocked-host` header so you can see which rule it matched.\n\n![Network tab of dev tools showing blocked host](https://docs.cypress.io/img/guides/references/v10/blocked-host.png)\n\n### devServer[​](#devServer \"Direct link to devServer\")\n\nThe `devServer` option is required for [`component`](#component) testing, and allows you to register a component testing dev server.\n\nTypically, you will specify a `framework` and `bundler` options in `devServer` for your framework and UI library like so:\n\n*   cypress.config.js\n*   cypress.config.ts\n\n```\nconst { defineConfig } = require('cypress')module.exports = defineConfig({  component: {    devServer: {      framework: 'create-react-app',      bundler: 'webpack',    },  },})\n```\n\nSee [Framework Configuration](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/component-testing/component-framework-configuration) guide for more info on all the available `framework` and `bundler` options, as well as additional configuration options.\n\n#### Custom Dev Server[​](#Custom-Dev-Server \"Direct link to Custom Dev Server\")\n\nIt is possible to customize the devServer and provide your own function for custom or advanced setups.\n\nThe devServer function receives a `cypressConfig` argument:\n\n*   cypress.config.js\n*   cypress.config.ts\n\n```\nconst { defineConfig } = require('cypress')module.exports = defineConfig({  component: {    devServer(cypressConfig) {      // return dev server instance or a promise that resolves to      // a dev server instance here    },  },})\n```\n\nSee the [Custom Dev Server](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/component-testing/component-framework-configuration) guide for more info.\n\n### excludeSpecPattern[​](#excludeSpecPattern \"Direct link to excludeSpecPattern\")\n\nCypress uses `minimatch` with the options: `{dot: true, matchBase: true}`. We suggest using [https://globster.xyz](https://globster.xyz/) to test what files would match.\n\nThe `**/node_modules/**` pattern is automatically added to `excludeSpecPattern`, and does not need to be specified (and can't be overridden). See [`e2e`](#e2e) or [`component`](#component) testing-specific options.\n\n### isInteractive[​](#isInteractive \"Direct link to isInteractive\")\n\nYou can open Cypress in the interactive mode via the `cypress open` command, and in run mode via the `cypress run` command. To detect the mode from your test code you can query the `isInteractive` property on [Cypress.config](https://docs.cypress.io/api/cypress-api/config).\n\n```\nif (Cypress.config('isInteractive')) {  // interactive \"cypress open\" mode!} else {  // \"cypress run\" mode}\n```\n\n### modifyObstructiveCode[​](#modifyObstructiveCode \"Direct link to modifyObstructiveCode\")\n\nWith this option enabled - Cypress will search through the response streams coming from your server on `.html` and `.js` files and replace code that matches patterns commonly found in framebusting.\n\nThese script patterns are antiquated and deprecated security techniques to prevent clickjacking and framebusting. They are a relic of the past and are no longer necessary in modern browsers. However many sites and applications still implement them.\n\nThese techniques prevent Cypress from working, and they can be safely removed without altering any of your application's behavior.\n\nCypress modifies these scripts at the network level, and therefore there is a tiny performance cost to search the response streams for these patterns.\n\nYou can turn this option off if the application or site you're testing **does not** implement these security measures. Additionally it's possible that the patterns we search for may accidentally rewrite valid JS code. If that's the case, please disable this option.\n\nDetails for `experimentalModifyObstructiveThirdPartyCode` can be found [here](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/web-security#Modifying-Obstructive-Third-Party-Code).\n\n### setupNodeEvents[​](#setupNodeEvents \"Direct link to setupNodeEvents\")\n\nThe `setupNodeEvents` function allows you to tap into, modify, or extend the internal behavior of Cypress using the [`on`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/plugins/writing-a-plugin#on) and [`config`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/plugins/writing-a-plugin#config) arguments, and is valid as an [`e2e`](#e2e) or [`component`](#component) testing specific option.\n\ninfo\n\nThis function was added in Cypress version `10.0.0` to replace the deprecated [plugins file](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/legacy-configuration#Plugins).\n\n*   cypress.config.js\n*   cypress.config.ts\n\n```\nconst { defineConfig } = require('cypress')module.exports = defineConfig({  e2e: {    setupNodeEvents(on, config) {      // e2e testing node events setup code    },  },  component: {    setupNodeEvents(on, config) {      // component testing node events setup code    },  },})\n```\n\nSee the [plugins guide](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/tooling/plugins-guide) for more information.\n\n## Common problems[​](#Common-problems \"Direct link to Common problems\")\n\n#### `baseUrl` is not set[​](#baseUrl-is-not-set \"Direct link to baseUrl-is-not-set\")\n\nMake sure you do not accidentally place the `baseUrl` config option into the `env` object. The following configuration is _incorrect_ and will not work:\n\n*   cypress.config.js\n*   cypress.config.ts\n\n```\nconst { defineConfig } = require('cypress')module.exports = defineConfig({  // ⛔️ DOES NOT WORK  env: {    baseUrl: 'http://localhost:3030',    FOO: 'bar',  },})\n```\n\nSolution: place the `baseUrl` property outside the `env` object and inside the [e2e](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration#e2e) testing-type specific object.\n\n*   cypress.config.js\n*   cypress.config.ts\n\n```\nconst { defineConfig } = require('cypress')module.exports = defineConfig({  // ✅ THE CORRECT WAY  env: {    FOO: 'bar',  },  e2e: {    baseUrl: 'http://localhost:3030',  },})\n```\n\nYou can also find a few tips on setting the `baseUrl` in this [short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5UaXuAc52c).\n\n#### Test files not found when using `spec` parameter[​](#Test-files-not-found-when-using-spec-parameter \"Direct link to Test-files-not-found-when-using-spec-parameter\")\n\nWhen using the `--spec <path or mask>` argument, make it relative to the project's folder. If the specs are still missing, run Cypress with [DEBUG logs](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/troubleshooting#Print-DEBUG-logs) with the following setting to see how Cypress is looking for spec files:\n\n```\nDEBUG=cypress:cli,cypress:server:specs\n```\n\n## History[​](#History \"Direct link to History\")\n\n| Version | Changes |\n| --- | --- |\n| [13.4.0](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/changelog#13-4-0) | Added support for configuring the Experimental Flake Detection strategy via `retries.experimentalStrategy` and `retries.experimentalOptions`. |\n| [13.0.0](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/changelog#13-0-0) | Removed `nodeVersion` option. |\n| [13.0.0](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/changelog#13-0-0) | Removed `videoUploadOnPasses` option. |\n| [11.0.0](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/changelog#11-0-0) | Removed `e2e.experimentalSessionAndOrigin` option. |\n| [10.4.0](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/changelog#10-4-0) | Added `e2e.testIsolation` option. |\n| [10.0.0](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/changelog#10-0-0) | Reworked page to support new `cypress.config.js` and deprecated `cypress.json` files. |\n| [8.7.0](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/changelog#8-7-0) | Added `slowTestThreshold` option. |\n| [8.0.0](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/changelog#8-0-0) | Added `clientCertificates` option and removed `firefoxGcInterval` configuration. |\n| [7.0.0](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/changelog#7-0-0) | Added `e2e` and `component` options. |\n| [7.0.0](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/changelog#7-0-0) | Added `redirectionLimit` option. |\n| [6.1.0](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/changelog#6-1-0) | Added `scrollBehavior` option. |\n| [5.2.0](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/changelog#5-2-0) | Added `includeShadowDom` option. |\n| [5.0.0](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/changelog#5-0-0) | Added `retries` configuration. |\n| [5.0.0](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/changelog#5-0-0) | Renamed `blacklistHosts` configuration to `blockHosts`. |\n| [4.1.0](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/changelog#4-12-0) | Added `screenshotOnRunFailure` configuration. |\n| [4.0.0](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/changelog#4-0-0) | Added `firefoxGcInterval` configuration. |\n| [3.5.0](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/changelog#3-5-0) | Added `nodeVersion` configuration. |\n\n## See also[​](#See-also \"Direct link to See also\")\n\n*   [Cypress.config()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/cypress-api/config) and [Cypress.env()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/cypress-api/env)\n*   [Environment variables](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/environment-variables)\n*   [Environment Variables recipe](https://docs.cypress.io/examples/recipes#Fundamentals)\n*   Blog post [Keep passwords secret in E2E tests](https://glebbahmutov.com/blog/keep-passwords-secret-in-e2e-tests/)",

Fixed in [#28627](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/28627).\n*   Correctly sync `Cypress.currentRetry` with secondary origin so test retries that leverage [`cy.origin()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/origin) render logs as expected. Fixes [#28574](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/28574).\n*   Fixed an issue where some cross-origin logs, like assertions or cy.clock(), were getting too many dom snapshots. Fixes [#28609](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/28609).\n*   Fixed asset capture for Test Replay for requests that are routed through service workers. This addresses an issue where styles were not being applied properly in Test Replay and [`cy.intercept()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/intercept) was not working properly for requests in this scenario. Fixes [#28516](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/28516).\n*   Fixed an issue where visiting an `http://` site would result in an infinite reload/redirect loop in Chrome 114+.

Fixes [#28545](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/28545).\n\n**Dependency Updates:**\n\n*   Remove dependency on `@types/node` package. Addresses [#28473](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/28473).\n*   Updated [`@cypress/unique-selector`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cypress/unique-selector) to include a performance optimization. It's possible this could improve performance of the selector playground. Addressed in [#28571](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/28571).\n*   Replace [`CircularJSON`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/circular-json) with its successor [`flatted`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/flatted) version `3.2.9`. This resolves decoding issues observed in complex objects sent from the browser. Addressed in [#28683](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/28683).\n*   Updated [`better-sqlite3`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/better-sqlite3) from `8.7.0` to `9.2.2` to fix macOS Catalina issues.

Fixes [#28350](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/28350).\n*   Fixed an issue where request logging would default the `message` to the `args` of the currently running command even though those `args` would not apply to the request log and are not displayed. If the `args` are sufficiently large (e.g. when running the `cy.task` from the [code-coverage](https://github.com/cypress-io/code-coverage/) plugin) there could be performance/memory implications. Addressed in [#28411](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/28411).\n*   Fixed an issue where commands would fail with the error `must only be invoked from the spec file or support file` if the project's `baseUrl` included basic auth credentials.

Addresses [#27206](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/27206).\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Fixed a regression introduced in Cypress [13.0.0](#13-0-0) where the [Module API](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/module-api), [`after:run`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/plugins/after-run-api), and [`after:spec`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/plugins/after-spec-api) results did not include the `stats.skipped` field for each run result. Fixes [#27694](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/27694). Addressed in [#27695](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/27695).\n*   Individual CDP errors that occur while capturing data for Test Replay will no longer prevent the entire run from being available. Addressed in [#27709](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/27709).\n*   Fixed an issue where the release date on the `v13` landing page was a day behind. Fixed in [#27711](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/27711).\n*   Fixed an issue where fatal protocol errors would leak between specs causing all subsequent specs to fail to upload protocol information. Fixed in [#27720](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/27720)\n*   Updated `plist` from `3.0.6` to `3.1.0` to address [CVE-2022-37616](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-9pgh-qqpf-7wqj) and [CVE-2022-39353](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-crh6-fp67-6883). Fixed in [#27710](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/27710).\n\n## 13.0.0[​](#13-0-0 \"Direct link to 13.0.0\")\n\n_Released 08/29/2023_\n\n**Summary:**\n\nWhen recording to Cypress Cloud, users now receive our newest feature: [Test Replay](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/cloud/test-replay). Test Replay brings the debugging experience you know and love from the Cypress app directly into your recorded tests in Cypress Cloud.\n\nPreviously, trying to debug failures and flake in CI was painful and time consuming with only videos & screenshots. Test Replay provides a way to inspect the DOM, network events, and console logs of your application from your tests exactly as they ran in CI.\n\nTest Replay is available in all Cypress Cloud plans. To start using Test Replay, simply record a run to Cypress Cloud. Learn more in the [Test Replay documentation](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/cloud/test-replay).\n\nTest Replay now serves as the primary replacement for debugging via video. Video capture and `videoCompression` of captured video are now set to `false` by default and `videoUploadOnPasses` is removed.\n\nRead more about v13.0.0 in [our blog post](https://on.cypress.io/cypress-13-release).\n\n**Breaking Changes:**\n\n*   The [`video`](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration#Videos) configuration option now defaults to `false`. Addresses [#26157](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/26157).\n*   The [`videoCompression`](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration#Videos) configuration option now defaults to `false`. Addresses [#26160](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/26160).\n*   The [`videoUploadOnPasses`](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration#Videos) configuration option has been removed. Please see our [screenshots & videos guide](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/screenshots-and-videos#Delete-videos-for-specs-without-failing-or-retried-tests) on how to accomplish similar functionality. Addresses [#26899](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/26899).\n*   Requests for assets at relative paths for component testing are now correctly forwarded to the dev server. Fixes [#26725](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/26725).\n*   The [`cy.readFile()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/readfile) command is now retry-able as a [query command](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/retry-ability). This should not affect any tests using it; the functionality is unchanged. However, it can no longer be overwritten using [`Cypress.Commands.overwrite()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/cypress-api/custom-commands#Overwrite-Existing-Commands). Addressed in [#25595](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/25595).\n*   The deprecated configuration option `nodeVersion` has been removed. Addresses [#27016](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/27016).\n*   The properties and values returned by the [Module API](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/module-api) and included in the arguments of handlers for the [`after:run`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/plugins/after-run-api) and [`after:spec`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/plugins/after-spec-api) have been changed to be more consistent. Addresses [#23805](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23805).\n*   For Cypress Cloud runs with Test Replay enabled, the Cypress Runner UI is now hidden during the run. This change was made to improve performance in situations where the Runner no longer needs to be rendered. If video is recorded during the run, the Runner will not be visible. In addition, if a screenshot with `capture: runner` is taken, the screenshot will be taken as if the `capture: viewport` option was passed. You can turn off this behavior by passing [`--runner-ui`](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-run-runner-ui). Addressed in [#27482](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/27482).\n*   The browser and browser page unexpectedly closing in the middle of a test run are now gracefully handled. Addressed in [#27592](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/27592).\n*   Automation performance is now improved by switching away from websockets to direct CDP calls for Chrome and Electron browsers. Addressed in [#27592](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/27592).\n*   Edge cases where `cy.intercept` would not properly intercept have been addressed. Addressed in [#27592](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/27592).\n*   Node 14 support has been removed and Node 16 support has been deprecated. Node 16 may continue to work with Cypress `v13`, but will not be supported moving forward to closer coincide with [Node 16's end-of-life](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/announcements/nodejs16-eol) schedule. It is recommended that users update to at least Node 18.\n*   The minimum supported TypeScript version is `4.x`.\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   Added [`--runner-ui`](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-run-runner-ui) and [`--no-runner-ui`](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-run-no-runner-ui) CLI flags to control whether the Cypress Runner UI is visible during a run. Addressed in [#27582](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/27582).\n*   Consolidates and improves terminal output when uploading test artifacts to Cypress Cloud. Addressed in [#27402](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/27402)\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Fixed an issue where Cypress's internal `tsconfig` would conflict with properties set in the user's `tsconfig.json` such as `module` and `moduleResolution`. Fixes [#26308](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/26308) and [#27448](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/27448).\n*   Clarified Svelte 4 works correctly with Component Testing and updated dependencies checks to reflect this. It was incorrectly flagged as not supported. Fixes [#27465](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/27465).\n*   Resolve the `process/browser` global inside `@cypress/webpack-batteries-included-preprocessor` to resolve to `process/browser.js` in order to explicitly provide the file extension. File resolution must include the extension for `.mjs` and `.js` files inside ESM packages in order to resolve correctly. Fixes[#27599](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/27599).\n*   Fixed an issue where the correct `pnp` process was not being discovered. Fixes [#27562](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/27562).\n*   Fixed incorrect type declarations for Cypress and Chai globals that asserted them to be local variables of the global scope rather than properties on the global object. Fixes [#27539](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/27539). Fixed in [#27540](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/27540).\n*   Dev Servers will now respect and use the `port` configuration option if present. Fixes [#27675](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/27675).\n\n**Dependency Updates:**\n\n*   Upgraded [`@cypress/request`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cypress/request) from `^2.88.11` to `^3.0.0` to address the [CVE-2023-28155](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-p8p7-x288-28g6) security vulnerability. Addresses [#27535](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/27535). Addressed in [#27495](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/27495).\n\n## 12.17.4[​](#12-17-4 \"Direct link to 12.17.4\")\n\n_Released 08/15/2023_\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Fixed an issue where having `cypress.config` in a nested directory would cause problems with locating the `component-index.html` file when using component testing. Fixes [#26400](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/26400).\n\n**Dependency Updates:**\n\n*   Upgraded [`webpack`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack) from `v4` to `v5`. This means that we are now bundling your `e2e` tests with webpack 5. We don't anticipate this causing any noticeable changes. However, if you'd like to keep bundling your `e2e` tests with webpack 4 you can use the same process as before by pinning [@cypress/webpack-batteries-included-preprocessor](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cypress/webpack-batteries-included-preprocessor) to `v2.x.x` and hooking into the [file:preprocessor](https://docs.cypress.io/api/plugins/preprocessors-api#Usage) plugin event. This will restore the previous bundling process. Additionally, if you're using [@cypress/webpack-batteries-included-preprocessor](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cypress/webpack-batteries-included-preprocessor) already, a new version has been published to support webpack `v5`.\n*   Upgraded [`tough-cookie`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tough-cookie) from `4.0` to `4.1.3`, [`@cypress/request`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cypress/request) from `2.88.11` to `2.88.12` and [`@cypress/request-promise`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cypress/request-promise) from `4.2.6` to `4.2.7` to address a [security vulnerability](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-TOUGHCOOKIE-5672873). Fixes [#27261](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/27261).\n\n## 12.17.3[​](#12-17-3 \"Direct link to 12.17.3\")\n\n_Released 08/01/2023_\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Fixed an issue where unexpected branch names were being recorded for cypress runs when executed by GitHub Actions. The `HEAD` branch name will now be recorded by default for pull request workflows if a branch name cannot otherwise be detected from user overrides or from local git data. Fixes [#27389](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/27389).\n\n**Performance:**\n\n*   Fixed an issue where unnecessary requests were being paused. No longer sends `X-Cypress-Is-XHR-Or-Fetch` header and infers resource type off of the server pre-request object. Fixes [#26620](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/26620) and [#26622](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/26622).\n\n## 12.17.2[​](#12-17-2 \"Direct link to 12.17.2\")\n\n_Released 07/20/2023_\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Fixed an issue where commands would fail with the error `must only be invoked from the spec file or support file` if their arguments were mutated.

Addresses [#23913](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23913).\n\n## 12.3.0[​](#12-3-0 \"Direct link to 12.3.0\")\n\n_Released 1/03/2023_\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   Added support for mapping the `CYPRESS_PULL_REQUEST_ID`, `CYPRESS_PULL_REQUEST_URL`, and/or `CYPRESS_CI_BUILD_URL` environment variables to the the corresponding Cloud run. This provides workarounds when supported CI provider mappings are incorrect or unsupported CI providers are used. Addressed in [#25036](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/25036).\n*   Added new Cypress API, [`Cypress.currentRetry`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/cypress-api/currentretry), to easily access the current test retry count. Addresses [#25239](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/25239).\n\n**Performance:**\n\n*   Increased the pre-request proxy cleanup interval. The previous cleanup interval was too aggressive for projects loading a large number of JS modules, causing applications to load very slowly and in chunks. Fixed in [#25209](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/25209).\n*   Fixed an issue where browsers distributed as universal binaries (Chrome, Firefox) on M1 Macs could be launched in the wrong architecture, resulting in poor performance in-browser. Fixed in [#25014](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/25014).\n*   Resolved a delay that could occur on startup when using a custom Cypress configuration file location in projects with a transitive `typescript` dependency. Fixes [#24781](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24781).\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Fixes an issue where component test files that contained characters, such as brackets (`[]`), would be ignored when running tests. This is a common pattern in Next.js and Gatsby.js projects. Fixes [#24588](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24588).\n*   Updated the Jenkins environment variable mappings so pull request data is correctly linked to the corresponding Cloud run. Fixed in [#25036](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/25036).\n*   Fixed a regression in [`10.11.0`](#10-11-0) where the mocha test results no longer sent the pending boolean to reporters. This caused the [`mochaawesome`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mochawesome) reporter to incorrectly report pending tests as pending and skipped. Fixes [#24477](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24477).\n*   Fix for regression introduced in [`12.1.0`](#12-1-0), where [`.contains()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/contains) could return multiple elements instead of one element when it was matching directly on the subject, rather than on the subject's children. Fixes [#25225](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/25225).\n*   Fixed a small visual bug in the Test Runner such that Chrome users will no longer see a white border on the nav bar at the specific zoom levels. Fixes [#25284](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/25284).\n\n**Misc**\n\n*   Remove the redundant `Need help` link from the migration information modal because the modal provides in-depth details for users already. Addresses [#21923](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/21923).\n*   Minor UI updates were make to truncate the browser's name when it exceeds the allocated space and to only show the browsers's major version in the UI. Addresses [#21730](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/21730) and [#21755](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/21755).\n*   Removed the line break that was displayed on the Settings page when a configuration value was an empty object. Addresses [#21790](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/21790).\n\n**Dependency Updates:**\n\n*   Upgraded [`engine.io`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/engine.io) from `5.2.1` to `6.2.1` to address this [security vulnerability](https://github.com/socketio/engine.io/security/advisories/GHSA-r7qp-cfhv-p84w) where a specially crafted HTTP request can trigger an uncaught exception on the Engine.IO server, thus killing the Node.js process. Addressed in [#23843](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23843).\n*   Upgraded [`express`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) from `4.17.1` to `4.17.3` to address this [NVD security vulnerability](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24999). Addressed in [#23843](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23843).\n*   Upgraded [`simple-git`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/simple-git) from `3.4.0` to `3.15.0` to address this [NVD security vulnerability](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-25912). Addressed in [#23843](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23843).\n\n## 12.2.0[​](#12-2-0 \"Direct link to 12.2.0\")\n\n_Released 12/20/2022_\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   Added the ability to match on `resourceType` with [`cy.intercept()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/intercept), and to see the resource type of an intercepted request as `req.resourceType`. Addresses [#14525](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14525).\n*   Users working in React Component Testing projects can now generate a basic spec file from the components that exist in their project. Addresses [#24008](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24008).\n\n**Performance:**\n\n*   Fixed a regression introduced in the Electron browser in [Cypress 10.8.0](#10-8-0) where the `CYPRESS_EVERY_NTH_FRAME` environment variable was not being set appropriately causing all frames to be captured which slowed down tests. Fixes [#23830](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23830).\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Fixed an issue where the `query` object was not available on requests from [`cy.intercept()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/intercept) once they were yielded. Fixes [#25088](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/25088).\n*   Fixed an issue with Angular Component Testing where urls within SASS/SCSS files were not being correctly resolved which could result in incomplete styling. Fixes [#24272](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24272).\n*   Fixed a regression introduced in [Cypress 12](#12-0-0) where [`cy.get()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/get) would ignore a `null` value for the `withinSubject` option. Fixes [#25104](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/25104).\n*   Fixed an issue where an unhandled promise rejection would display an incomplete error message in the command log. Fixes [#24915](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24915).\n*   Fixed an issue where the incorrect Cypress version could be shown in the migration wizard. Fixes [#25138](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/25138).\n*   Fixed an issue where the Cypress migration wizard would fail to run in [global mode](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-open-global) on newer versions of Cypress. Addressed in [#25138](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/25138).\n*   Fixed an issue with Angular Component Testing where a custom [`sourceRoot`](https://angular.io/guide/workspace-config#project-configuration-options) configuration would not be respected. Fixes [#24827](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24827).\n*   Fixed TypeScript typings for [`cy.nextUntil()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/nextuntil) to include the `filter` parameter. Fixes [#24772](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24772).\n\n## 12.1.0[​](#12-1-0 \"Direct link to 12.1.0\")\n\n_Released 12/12/2022_\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   Added [`cy.getAllCookies()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/getallcookies) and [`cy.clearAllCookies()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/clearallcookies), which get and clear cookies for all browser cookies across any domains. Addresses [#24265](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24265), [#8956](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8956), and [#408](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/408).\n*   Updated the error messaging to provide more context when parallel group parameters are mismatched when sent to the Cypress Cloud. Fixes [#24734](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24734).\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Fixed an issue with the `cy.session` command where it now recollects the session data after validation is successful to correctly store the full browser context before the command ends. Addressed with [#25112](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/25112).\n*   Fixed an issue where recent versions of Firefox in headless mode would behave inconsistently with headed. Fixes [#24900](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24900).\n*   Fixed an issue where [`.select(index)`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/select#Index) would fail when multiple `<option>` elements have the same value property. Fixes [#24739](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24739).\n*   Cleaned up temp files generated by `cypress run`. Addressed by [#24957](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/24957)\n*   The Chrome web security configuration tooltip will now be shown only if [`chromeWebSecurity`](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/web-security#Disabling-Web-Security) is set to false when using a non-chromium browser. Fixes [#23846](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23846).\n*   Fixed an issue where updating a component would not trigger the `supportFile` to reload imported stylesheets. This is fixed by doing a full reload for Vite, to ensure the spec re-runs correctly with the latest styles. Fixes [#24874](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24874).\n*   The [Run All Specs experiment](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/experiments#End-to-End-Testing) will now open in a new tab rather than close and reopen the browser. This will make the run faster and help mitigate [#21743](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/21743). Fixes [#24919](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24919).\n\n## 12.0.2[​](#12-0-2 \"Direct link to 12.0.2\")\n\n_Released 12/08/2022_\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Fixed a regression in [12.0.0](#12-0-0) where [`.contains()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/contains) received multiple elements as a subject, it only searched inside the first one. Fixes [#25025](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/25025)\n*   Fixed a regression in [12.0.0](#12-0-0) around [`.contains()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/contains) where if the subject was a `<form>` element, it would only consider the first `<input>` element in the form, rather than every child. Fixes [#25019](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/25019)\n\n## 12.0.1[​](#12-0-1 \"Direct link to 12.0.1\")\n\n_Released 12/06/2022_\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Fixed a regression in [11.2.0](#11-2-0) where a stale spec search pattern was shown in the spec search bar after re-launching Cypress. Fixes [#24936](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24936)\n*   Fixed a regression in [12.0.0](#12-0-0) where tests scaffolded into new projects were using a removed api. Fixed in [#25006](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/25006)\n*   Fixed regression in [12.0.0](#12-0-0) where setting `e2e.testIsolation=false` caused invalid configuration validation when running `cypress run --component`. Fixes [#25007](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/25007)\n*   Fixed a regression introduced in [12.0.0](#12-0-0) that sometimes does not allow cy.origin() to communicate correctly with the navigated to domain. Fixes [#25010](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/25010)\n\n## 12.0.0[​](#12-0-0 \"Direct link to 12.0.0\")\n\n_Released 12/06/2022_\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe Session and Origin Experiment is now generally available for end-to-end testing. This means Cypress now fully supports:\n\n*   Testing multiple origins in a single test with the new [`cy.origin()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/origin) command.\n*   Caching and restoring cookies, [`localStorage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage), and [`sessionStorage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) between tests\n*   Configuring [`testIsolation`](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/writing-and-organizing-tests#Test-Isolation) in suites to define whether or not the browser context is cleaned or persisted between tests\n\nAdditionally in this release, enhancements were made to how Cypress manages DOM element resolution to reduce the likelihood of hitting detached DOM errors due to maintaining stale DOM references. We've updated our [Retry-ability Guide](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/retry-ability) with all the details if you'd like to learn more.\n\nRead more about 12.0 in [our blog post](https://on.cypress.io/cypress-12-release).\n\n**Breaking Changes:**\n\n*   Cypress dropped support for Node.js 12, 15 and 17. Those versions have reached end-of-life. Installing Cypress on your system now requires Node.js 14, 16 or 18+. Addressed in [#24885](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/24885).\n*   Cypress has always recommended writing tests in a clean context. In Cypress 12, we enforce running tests in a clean browser context through [test isolation](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/writing-and-organizing-tests#Test-Isolation). This option is configurable, but is enabled by default. Whether enabled or disabled, this changes how Cypress cleans up the browser context before each test and you may experience test errors with this upgrade. To better understand the full impact of this change, please review the [migration guide](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/migration-guide#Test-Isolation).\n    *   In Cypress v12, the `testIsolation` configuration values have changed from `on` or `off` to `true` or `false`. Addressed in [#24935](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/24935).\n*   The `experimentalSessionAndOrigin` configuration option has been removed and all functionality associated with this experiment is now enabled by default, with the exception of using `require` and `import` with callback supplied to the [`cy.origin()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/origin) command. To leverage external dependencies in `cy.origin()` callbacks, set the new [`e2e.experimentalOriginDependencies`](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/experiments#End-to-End-Testing) configuration option to `true`. Addresses [#21471](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/21471).\n*   The `Cookies.defaults` and `Cookies.preserveOnce` APIs have been removed. Use the new [`cy.session()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/session) command to preserve cookies between tests. Addresses [#21472](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/21472).\n*   The `cy.server()` and `cy.route()` commands have been removed. Additionally, the corresponding `Cypress.Server.defaults` API has also been removed. Use the \\[`cy.intercept()`(/api/commands/intercept) command to stub network responses and requests. Addresses [#22126](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/22126).\n*   The Cookie commands now uses the `hostname` as the domain by default instead of the `superdomain`. This change aligns Cypress' cookie rules with the browser cookie rules. This may affect what cookies are returned by [`cy.getCookie()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/getcookie), what cookies are set with [`cy.setCookie()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/setcookie), and the cookies cleared with [`cy.clearCookies()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/clearcookies). Addresses [#363](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/363), [#5723](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5723) and [#24526](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24526).\n*   The [`.within()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/within) command now requires a single subject and throws an error if given more than one subject. This change adds consistency around how `.within()` behaves across commands. Previously some commands inside a `.within()` callback would silently select the first element, while others would use all of the previously yielded subjects, and others would throw an error. Addressed in [#24975](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/24975).\n*   Cypress now throws an error if any Cypress commands are invoked from inside a [`.should()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/should) callback. This previously resulted in unusual and undefined behavior. Addresses [#5963](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5963), [#14656](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14656) and [#22587](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/22587).\n*   The [`.invoke()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/invoke) command now throws an error if the invoked function returns a promise. If you wish to call a method that returns a promise and wait for it to resolve, use [`.then()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/then) instead of `.invoke()`. Addressed in [#24417](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/24417).\n*   The [`cy.request()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/request) command now uses [`querystringify`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/querystringify) to stringify & parse the `qs` options. This change aligns with how the [`cy.visit()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/visit) command generates urls with query parameters. Addressed in [#20302](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20302).\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   Added a new configuration option called `testIsolation`, which defaults to `true`. This option can be set at the `e2e` or suite-level to determine whether or not [test isolation](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/writing-and-organizing-tests#Test-Isolation) is enabled to ensure a clean browser context between tests. Addressed in [#22230](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/22230).\n*   The previously experimental Cypress command, [`cy.origin()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/origin), is now generally available in end-to-end testing. This command allows testing multiple origins in a single test. Addresses [#17336](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/17336).\n*   The previously experimental Cypress command, [`cy.session()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/session), is now generally available. This command caches and restores `cookies`, [`localStorage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage), and [`sessionStorage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) in order to recreate a consistent browser context between tests. Addresses [#20977](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/20977).\n*   Added a new Cypress command, [`cy.getAllLocalStorage()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/getalllocalstorage), to get [`localStorage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) data for all origins with which the test has interacted. Addresses [#24276](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24276).\n*   Added a new Cypress command, [`cy.clearAllLocalStorage()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/clearalllocalstorage), to clear [`localStorage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) data for all origins with which the test has interacted. Addresses [#24276](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24276).\n*   Added a new Cypress command, [`cy.getAllSessionStorage()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/getallsessionstorage), to get [`sessionStorage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/sessionStorage) data for all origins with which the test has interacted. Addresses [#24276](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24276).\n*   Added a new Cypress command, [`cy.clearAllSessionStorage()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/clearallsessionstorage), to clear [`sessionStorage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/sessionStorage) data for all origins with which the test has interacted. Addresses [#24276](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24276).\n*   Added a new configuration option called [`experimentalOriginDependencies`](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/experiments#End-to-End-Testing), which defaults to `false`. This option enables support for `require` and `import` within the callback supplied to the [`cy.origin()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/origin) command in end-to-end testing. Previously this feature was enabled through the `experimentalSessionAndOrigin` configuration option. `experimentalOriginDependencies` was added as a configuration option in Cypress 12, instead of being enabled by default, due to increased Node.js memory usage associated with this option that needs to be addressed before making this behavior generally available. See issue [#24976](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24976) for more information. Addressed in [#24931](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/24931).\n*   Added a new `Cypress.ensure` API which provides several methods that can be helpful when writing customs commands. Addressed in [#24697](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/24697).\n*   Added a new \"Run All\" button to the [`experimentalRunAllSpecs`](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/experiments#End-to-End-Testing) experiment which enables running all spec files returned from the `specPattern` glob or an array of globs, regardless of the specs sharing a root folder. Addresses [#24759](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24759).\n*   Further improved bundling in the binary to reduce startup and unzip time. Addressed in [#24909](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/24909)\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Fixed a regression in [10.11.0](#10-11-0) where the Launchpad no longer showed a loading spinner on startup to indicate that it had successfully started and was in a loading state. Fixed [#24950](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24950).\n*   Fixed the \"Create Spec from Component\" capability to correctly scaffold the component spec from a component which contains special characters in its name. Before this change, a spec was scaffolded with either the wrong spec name or the incorrect component import which led to invalid JS errors. Fixes [#23492](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23492).\n*   Corrected Cypress environment variable resolution to correctly resolve environment variables set with `npm config set`. Fixes [#24556](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24556).\n*   When [`experimentalRunAllSpecs=true`](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/experiments#End-to-End-Testing), the \"Run N specs\" directory-level buttons in the Inline Specs List now function correctly when activated by the keyboard. Fixes [#24762](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/24762).\n*   Fixed unexpected behaviors when verifying a cookie was not returned from [`cy.getCookie()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/getcookie). Now it's possible to explicitly assert the cookie did not exist with `cy.getCookie('foo1').should('not.exist')`. Previously users had to verify cookies properties did not exist with `.its('value').should('equal', null)`. Addressed in [#24203](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/24203).\n*   Fixed the console output returned from clicking on an aliased intercept in the Command Log. It now logs the yielded request/response object associated to the intercepted call when clicked, where previously it did not log these details. Fixed in [#24623](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/24623).\n\n## 11.2.0[​](#11-2-0 \"Direct link to 11.2.0\")\n\n_Released 11/22/2022_\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   Re-implemented the 'Run All Specs' for End to End Testing for running multiple tests sequentially in open mode. This feature had been previously removed in Cypress 10.0. Enable 'Run All Specs' with the new experimental flag, [`experimentalRunAllSpecs`](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/experiments#End-to-End-Testing). Please leave any feedback around 'Run All Specs' [here](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/discussions/21628). Your feedback will help us make product decisions around the future of this feature. Addresses [#24168](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24168)\n*   Added messaging after failures in CI to direct people to set up recording to the Cypress Cloud if they are not already set up to do so. Addresses [#24000](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24000).\n*   Visually warn in the Command Log when the [`cy.session()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/session) command fails to restore a session to surface to users potential issues with their setup and validation. Addresses [#24207](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24207).\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   The [`cy.session()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/session) command no longer clears the page between setup and validation and will now always clear the page at the end of the command when test isolation is on. Fixes [#21397](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/21397).\n\n## 11.1.0[​](#11-1-0 \"Direct link to 11.1.0\")\n\n_Released 11/14/2022_\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   Next.js v13 is now supported. [#24396](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/24396)\n*   `mount()` now accepts an extensions.directives option, which will be registered globally for Vue2 component testing. [#24488](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/24488)\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Fixed an 11.0.0 regression where the migration workflow would error and hang for TypeScript projects. Fixes [#24643](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24643)\n*   Fixed an 11.0.0 regression where `cypress run` crashed when using the junit reporter and an assertion failed. Fixes [#24652](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24652)\n*   Fixed TypeScript types for `testIsolation`. Fixes [#23911](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23911)\n*   Sessions will no longer be stored if validation fails which will prevent a previously failed session from being restored in the next test. Fixes [#24208](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24208)\n\n**Experimental Breaking Changes:**\n\n*   Updates were made to enhance the cy.session() recovered error experience. With this change, cy.session() will no longer fail validation when false is returned from the validate callback. Fixes [#21398](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/21398), [#24205](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24205), and [#24593](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24593).\n\n## 11.0.1[​](#11-0-1 \"Direct link to 11.0.1\")\n\n_Released 11/09/2022_\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Fixed an 11.0.0 regression that caused enabling `experimentalSessionAndOrigin` to throw a webpack error. Fixes [#24611](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24611)\n*   Fixed an 11.0.0 regression where using custom reporters would cause Cypress to throw a 'Cannot find module' error. Fixes [#24607](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24607)\n*   Fixed `testIsolation` configuration validation to allow configuration updates without restarting Cypress. Fixes [#24497](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24497).\n*   Fixed an issue where `cy.origin()` would not prevent users from setting up `same-superdomain-origin` `cy.origin()` blocks. In these cases `cy.origin()` is not required and users would be better served by not using the command. Fixes [#24169](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24169)\n*   Fixed an 11.0.0 regression where modifying the currently loaded component testing spec in open mode does not trigger a rerun of the spec. Fixed by [#24630](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/24630)\n\n## 11.0.0[​](#11-0-0 \"Direct link to 11.0.0\")\n\n_Released 11/08/2022_\n\n**Summary:**\n\nComponent Testing is now generally available for projects using React, Next.js, Angular, and Vue!\n\nComponent tests allow you to see and test your application's components in a real browser as you work. You can use your favorite Cypress commands and features to develop your components without running your whole app. Learn more in our [blog](https://on.cypress.io/cypress-11-release) post.\n\nWe have also massively improved our startup performance by shipping a snapshot of our binary instead of the source files. The performance boost applies to the time it takes from running a cypress command (e.g. `cypress open`) to when the Cypress app is opened. Results will vary based on your situation, but we saw up to 84% faster startup times!\n\n**Breaking Changes:**\n\n**Read our [Migration Guide](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/migration-guide#Migrating-to-Cypress-110) which explains the breaking changes in more detail.**\n\n###### Component Testing:[​](#Component-Testing \"Direct link to Component Testing:\")\n\n*   Removed `cssFile`, `cssFiles`, `style`, `styles`, `stylesheet`, and `stylesheets` from the `options` argument to the `cy.mount()` function. We recommend writing test-specific styles in a separate `css` file you import in your test, or in your `supportFile`. See [migration guide](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/migration-guide#Changes-to-Mounting-Options). Addresses [#24328](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24328).\n*   Subsequent `cy.mount` calls within the same test will remove the last mounted component from the DOM. Addresses [#24329](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24329).\n*   `mountHook` from `cypress/react` has been removed. We recommend replacing it with `mount` and a component. See [migration guide](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/migration-guide#React---mountHook-Removed). Addresses [#24328](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24328).\n*   `unmount` from `cypress/react` has been removed. We recommend using the API React provides for unmounting components, [unmountComponentAtNode](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html#unmountcomponentatnode). See [migration guide](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/migration-guide#React---unmount-Removed). Addresses [#24328](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24328).\n*   `mountCallback` from `cypress/vue` has been removed. We recommend using `mount`. See [migration guide](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/migration-guide#Vue---mountCallback-Removed). Addresses [#24328](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24328).\n*   `mount` from `cypress/vue` now returns an object with both the VueWrapper (wrapper) and the component instance (component). Addresses [#24342](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24342).\n*   When providing an inline `viteConfig` inside of `cypress.config`, any `vite.config.js` file is not automatically merged. See [migration guide](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/migration-guide#Vite-Dev-Server-cypressvite-dev-server). Addresses [#24133](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24133).\n*   Angular providers passed as part of the mounting options will be assigned at the module level using the `TestBed.configureTestingModule` API. This means that module-level providers (resolved from imports or `@Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' })` can be overridden, but providers specified in `@Component({ providers: [...] })` will not be overridden when using `cy.mount(MyComponent, { providers: [...] })`. To override component-level providers, use the `TestBed.overrideComponent` API. See [migration guide](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/migration-guide#Angular---Providers-Mounting-Options-Change). Addresses [#24047](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24047) and [#23427](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23427).\n\n###### General:[​](#General \"Direct link to General:\")\n\n*   Communication with the Cypress Dashboard will now verify CAs and reject any unauthorized calls. If you use a self-signed CA you will need to set `npm_config_ca`, `npm_config_cafile`, or `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`. Addresses [#23980](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23980).\n\n###### Experimental:[​](#Experimental \"Direct link to Experimental:\")\n\n*   [`cy.session()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/session) now requires a setup command to use the command. Addresses [#24311](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24311).\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   Incorporated V8 snapshots into the build process of the Electron binary to improve startup time and reduce the time to download and unzip the binary during installation. Startup time is the time from running a command to when Cypress's window is first opened. Addresses [#18480](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/18480).\n*   `cy.getCookie()`, `cy.getCookies()`, `cy.setCookie()`, `cy.clearCookie()`, and `cy.clearCookies()` now accept a domain option. Addresses [#24264](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24264).\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Fix types associated with `cy.mount()` that were incorrectly typed as `any`. Fixes [#24330](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24330).\n*   The `cy.mount()` snapshot now shows the mounted component instead of a blank page. Fixes [#24138](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24138).\n*   \"Open in IDE\" is no longer displayed in the command log for component tests. Fixes [#24366](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24366).\n*   Cypress now correctly handles CSVs and other non-html MIME types. Fixes [#24297](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24297).\n*   Cypress now supports project directories mounted on read-only file systems. Fixes [#2064](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2064).\n*   Snapshots now capture the AUT correctly when it has navigated away. Fixes [#24506](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24506).\n*   `cy.pause()` now functions correctly when called within the `cy.origin()` callback. Fixes [#21495](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/21495).\n*   When utilizing dependencies within the `cy.origin()` callback, errors now show the correct code frame. Fixes [#23365](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23365).\n*   The select dropdown (in Front-end Framework, Bundler, Organization, Project, Preferred Editor) now highlights and adds a checkmark to the selected option. Fixes [#21768](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/21768).\n*   The failure icon in the reporter header now displays correctly when there are a large number of successful tests. Fixes [#21838](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/21838).\n*   Cypress now allows more than twenty sessions to be created in a single test. Fixed in [#24379](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/24379).\n\n## 10.11.0[​](#10-11-0 \"Direct link to 10.11.0\")\n\n_Released 10/25/2022_\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   [`cy.session()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/session) is now supported when using [WebKit (Experimental)](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/launching-browsers#WebKit-Experimental) and `experimentalSessionAndOrigin` is enabled. Addresses [#24116](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24116), [#23832](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23832).\n*   Improves user experience when connecting a project to the Dashboard. Addresses [#23379](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23379), [#23766](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23766), [#23767](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23767).\n    *   Users will be prompted to connect a project to the Dashboard when logging in from the Cypress Launchpad after a testing type has been selected.\n    *   Users will be prompted to record runs to the Dashboard from both the Cypress App and Cypress Launchpad if a project is connected to the Dashboard and has no recorded runs.\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   When a chromium based browser tab or process crashes, Cypress will no longer hang indefinitely but will fail the current test and move on to the next. [#6170](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6170).\n*   Fixed as issue where browser-skipped tests were incorrectly recorded to the Dashboard which resulted in the Dashboard marking the test as \"new\" or \"modified\" when it already existed. Fixes [#23517](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23517).\n*   Fixed issue connecting to the cloud when a self-signed cert was in the cert chain. Fixes [#24298](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24298).\n*   [`cy.origin()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/origin) now supports more than 30 unique origin spec bridges per test. Fixes [#22874](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/22874), [#23967](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23967).\n*   Fixed an issue where `document.cookie` would not reflect the correct value in cross-origin tests. Fixes [#23531](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23531).\n*   Cypress will now restart on changes to the `blockHosts` configuration entry. Fixes [#22634](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/22634).\n*   When shown the command to record runs to the cloud, the user can select and copy parts of the command (like the record key), instead of only being able to use the \"Copy\" button to copy the entire command. Fixes [#22091](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/22091).\n*   Cleaned up inconsistencies in the UI between sentence case and title case. Fixes [#21854](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/21854).\n*   Fixed an issue where there is a visible \"Project ID\" section (with no `projectId`) when user has not connected to the Dashboard. [#21806](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/21806).\n\n**Experimental Breaking Changes:**\n\n*   [`cy.origin()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/origin) now supports using `require()` and dynamic `import()` to include dependencies. `Cypress.require()` has been removed. Addresses [#24293](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24293).\n*   The way that Cypress handles [test isolation](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/writing-and-organizing-tests#Test-Isolation) has changed. The previous modes of `legacy` and `strict` have been replaced with `on` and `off`. Fixes [#24206](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24206).\n    *   The default mode is `on` when [`experimentalSessionAndOrigin`](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/experiments) is enabled.\n    *   The [cy.session()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/session) command now inherits the test isolation behavior for the suite it runs in.\n\n## 10.10.0[​](#10-10-0 \"Direct link to 10.10.0\")\n\n_Released 10/11/2022_\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   [`cy.origin()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/origin)'s URL argument must be an exact origin match to the origin of the AUT.

Fixes [#23426](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23426).\n*   Fixed an regression introduced in Cypress [10.3.0](#10-3-0), and further exposed in [10.4.0](#10-4-0), that omitted `same-site` cookies when the URL Scheme, Domain, and Top Level Domain matched, but the ports are different (i.e. same-site). Fixes [#23132](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23132).\n*   Autoscrolling of the command log can no longer become disabled in `run` mode. This fixes an issue observed where the reporter randomly stops scrolling during a video recording and the Command log details are not visible. Fixes [#16098](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/16098) and [#22199](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/22199).\n*   The `cypress/react18` [`cy.mount()`](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/component-testing/react/overview) command's yielded rerender function has been updated to only create one `ReactDom.Root` element. This fixes the issue where state did not persist between rerenders, and all lifecycle hooks were reran when executed. Fixes [#23357](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23357).\n*   Fixed a regression introduced in Cypress [10.0.0](#10-0-0) where Cypress was incompatible with Chrome v64 - v70. Fixes [#23509](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23509).\n*   Fixes an issue where outdated organization and project information could be shown in dialogs when connecting a project to the Cypress Dashboard. Fixes [#23538](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23538).\n*   The `Sec-Fetch-Dest` [metadata request header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Fetch_metadata_request_header) is now set to `document` when the request is sent from the Application Under Test when the [`experimentalModifyObstructiveThirdPartyCode`](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/experiments#Configuration) experiment is enabled. This was updated to prevent Google Authentication from returning `403 forbidden` in Edge and Electron.

Addressed in [#21847](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/21847), [#23260](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23260) and [#23710](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23710).\n\n## 10.7.0[​](#10-7-0 \"Direct link to 10.7.0\")\n\n_Released 8/30/2022_\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   Re-introduces the experimental [Cypress Studio feature](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/cypress-studio). Cypress Studio provides a visual way to generate tests within Cypress by recording interactions against the application under test. Cypress Studio is available only in end-to-end tests, and must be enabled via the `e2e.experimentalStudio` flag. For more details, read [our blog post](https://www.cypress.io/blog/2022/08/30/how-to-use-studio-in-cypress-10-7). Addresses [#23461](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23461).\n*   Adds [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) component testing support. This feature is being released as an Alpha, meaning there may be breaking changes in future Cypress releases. Addresses [#23037](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23037).\n*   The \"Latest Runs\" and \"Average Duration\" columns in the specs list now provide actions when hovered over to assist with the process of connecting the project to the Cypress Dashboard. Addresses [#22932](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/22932).\n*   Informational banners were added to display instructions to assist with connecting projects to the Cypress Dashboard and recording a first test run. Users who don't plan to use the Cypress Dashboard can dismiss the banners to prevent seeing them in the future. Addresses [#22933](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/22933), [#22934](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/22934), [#22798](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/22798), and [#22935](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/22935).\n*   Vue.js projects with a custom spec pattern configuration can now use the \"Create Spec from Component\" capability introduced in v10.5.0. Addresses [#23071](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23071).\n*   Angular component testing projects can provide a custom configuration to the Webpack dev server using the [`projectConfig`](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/component-testing/angular/overview#Options-API) key. This enables support for projects that don't adhere to Angular CLI conventions. Addresses [#23161](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23161).\n*   The Cypress `clock` can now be set to a new time using the `setSystemTime` function. Addresses [#15424](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/15424).\n\n**Performance:**\n\n*   The `cy.session()` command's behavior has been enhanced to no longer clear the dom after a validation function runs. This means a `cy.visit()` command is no longer required after running `cy.session()` when a validation function is used. Addresses [#22368](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/22368).\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Fixed an issue where Cypress could crash if a websocket upgrade request was made over HTTPS. Fixes [#22217](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/22217).\n*   Fixed an issue where filtering with the `--spec` CLI flag in run mode option would not find any specs if the project was located at the root directory of a file system. Fixes [#23380](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23380).\n*   Fixed an issue where projects using Angular `v14.2.0` and above would be unable to run component tests. Fixes [#23585](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23585).\n*   Fixed an issue where snapshots performed in XHR requests could reflect the primary domain instead of current domain. Fixes [#21496](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/21496).\n*   An update was made to correctly track Github Actions retries in the Cypress Dashboard. Previously retries data was not being recorded. Addressed in [#23445](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/23445).\n*   Fixed an issue where an internal TypeScript type was exposed globally. Fixes [#23333](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/23333).\n*   Fixed an issue where an incomplete [`component.devServer`](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration#devServer) configuration would cause the specs list to not display in the Cypress App when running Component Tests in open mode. Fixes [#23486](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23486).\n\n**Miscellaneous:**\n\n*   Display a default icon in the browser selection menu for browsers without bundled icons. Fixes [#21766](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/21766).\n\n## 10.6.0[​](#10-6-0 \"Direct link to 10.6.0\")\n\n_Released 8/16/2022_\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   Introduced a new Cypress experiment, [`experimentalSingleTabRunMode`](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/experiments), for Component Testing. When enabled, all specs will execute in a single tab, similar to the execution behavior observed in Component Testing alpha in Cypress 9, which can improve `run` mode performance, but can impact spec isolation and reliability on large test suites. Addresses [#22353](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/22353).\n*   Enhanced the [`CYPRESS_DOWNLOAD_PATH_TEMPLATE`](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/advanced-installation#Environment-variables) environment variable interpolation to accept and replace `${version}` to allow version-specific download paths to be honored.

Fixes [#17896](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/17896).\n*   Fixed an issue in `cy.session()` where the unique session id logic was not persisting registered session ids, which incorrectly allowed session ids to override previously used session ids with different setups. Fixes [#22381](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/22381).\n*   Fixed an issue where absolute path glob manipulation was incorrectly breaking `supportFile` and `specPattern` glob patterns that contained deep instances of the working directory. Fixes [#23361](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23361).\n*   Fixed an issue with the Specs list search that prevented full path matching. Fixes [#22463](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/22463) and [#21879](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/21879).\n*   Fixed an issue where Specs list popovers would not display a spec's full filename. Fixes [#23064](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23064).\n\n## 10.5.0[​](#10-5-0 \"Direct link to 10.5.0\")\n\n_Released 8/15/2022_\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   Display a 'flaky test' indicator in the Specs Explorer for specs that are known to be flaky in the Dashboard.

Addresses [#22008](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/22008)\n\n## 10.0.0[​](#10-0-0 \"Direct link to 10.0.0\")\n\n_Released 6/1/2022_\n\n**Summary:**\n\nComponent testing is now beta! We've also reworked the Cypress app from the ground up to modernize the interface, streamline workflows and integrate better into your overall development experience. Read more about 10.0 in [our blog post](https://cypress.io/blog/2022/06/01/cypress-10-release/).\n\n**Breaking Changes:**\n\nPlease run `cypress open` to go through our interactive migration which will guide you in updating your files and configuration options. Read our [Migration Guide](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/migration-guide) which explains some breaking changes in more detail.\\*\\*\n\n*   We introduced several breaking changes to the **Cypress configuration file** detailed below:\n    \n    *   Using a `cypress.json` configuration file is no longer supported. Replace this configuration file with a `cypress.config.js`, `cypress.config.ts`, `cypress.config.cjs` or `cypress.config.mjs` file. This change provides better flexibility and extensibility of configuration. An error will be thrown if both a `cypress.json` file and `cypress.config.{cjs,js,mjs,ts}` file are found. Addressed in [#18221](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/18221), [#18300](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/18300), [#20554](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20554), and [#20643](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20643).\n    *   A Cypress configuration file is now required and passing the CLI flag `--config-file=false` will throw an error. Addressed in [#20643](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20643).\n    *   A default configuration file will no longer be auto-generated by Cypress when a configuration file doesn't exist. Instead, you can run `cypress open` and set up your project with a specific testing type to have this file generated. This allows you to customize the configuration setup by testing-type for the language and dependencies leveraged in your project.\n    *   The configuration file's JSON schema is no longer supported since the configuration can no longer be provided via a JSON format.\n*   Cypress has made several **configuration option changes** including renaming options, removing options, and only allowing some options within a specific testing type. Please run `cypress open` to have our automated migration update these options for you.\n    \n    *   Many configuration options are now specific to either end-to-end or component testing. The types have also been updated to match the new structure. Addressed in [#20677](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20677).\n    *   The `baseUrl` and `experimentalSessionAndOrigin` configuration options are no longer valid as top-level configuration options and can only be defined within the `e2e` configuration. Addressed in [#20589](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20589) and [#21588](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/21588).\n    *   The `supportFile` and `slowTestThreshold` options are no longer valid as top-level configuration options and must now be defined within the `e2e` and/or `component` configurations.\n    *   Previously the `supportFile` option defaulted to `cypress/support/index.js`. Now the [`e2e.supportFile`](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration#e2e) option defaults to `cypress/support/e2e.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}` and the [`component.supportFile`](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration#component) option defaults to `cypress/support/component.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}`. Addressed in [#19776](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/19776) and [#19364](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/19364).\n    *   The `pluginsFile` option was removed. This option should be replaced with the new [`setupNodeEvents()`](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration#setupNodeEvents) and [`devServer()`](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration#devServer) configuration options. Addressed in [#18798](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/18798) and [#20560](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20560).\n    *   The `testFiles` option was removed. This option was replaced with the new `specPattern` option. Addressed in [#19319](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/19319) and [#20565](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20565).\n    *   The `integrationFolder` and `componentFolder` options were removed. These options were made obsolete by the new `specPattern` option. Addressed in [#19319](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/19319).\n    *   The `ignoreTestFiles` option was removed. This option was replaced with the new `excludeSpecPattern` option. Addressed in [#19319](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/19319).\n    *   The `experimentalStudio` option was removed with the removal of the experimental Cypress Studio feature. If this option is configured in your project, a warning message will be displayed. Please leave any feedback around Cypress Studio [here](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/discussions/21561). Addressed in [#20515](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20515).\n*   During `cypress open`, the ability to \"Run all specs\" and \"Run filtered specs\" has been removed. Please leave feedback around the removal of this feature [here](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/discussions/21628). Your feedback will help us make product decisions around the future of this feature.\n    \n*   The experimental Cypress Studio feature has been removed. Please leave feedback around the removal of this feature [here](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/discussions/21561). Your feedback will help us make product decisions around the future of this feature. Addressed in [#20515](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20515).\n    \n*   You will no longer be able to run your tests during `cypress run` or `cypress open` in [browser versions that are not supported by Cypress](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/launching-browsers#Browser-versions-supported).\n    \n*   Generated screenshots and videos will still be created inside their respective folders (`screenshotsFolder`, `videosFolder`). However, the paths of generated files inside those folders will be stripped of any common ancestor paths shared between spec files found by the `specPattern` option and may no longer be deterministic. Addressed in [#19319](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/19319).\n    \n\n**Deprecations:**\n\n*   The `cypress open-ct` and `cypress run-ct` commands have been deprecated. Use `cypress open --component` and `cypress run --component` instead. Addresses [#18418](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/18418).\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   Cypress 10 now includes beta support for **component testing**. More features around component testing are detailed below:\n    \n    *   Component testing is now integrated directly into the main app, allowing you to choose which testing experience you want upon launching Cypress. See our [current support for frameworks and bundlers](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/component-testing/component-framework-configuration). Addressed in [#21111](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/21111).\n    *   Cypress will now guide you through installing the component testing dependencies and project setup necessary to begin component testing in Cypress. Previously this required manual setup and referencing the documentation.\n    *   When you use the Cypress app during `cypress open` to configure your project for CT testing, a [`cy.mount()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/mount) command will be automatically scaffolded for you in a `ct.supportFile`.\n    *   You can now create an empty component testing spec file from within the Cypress app directly and preview the specfile upon creation.\n    *   The following component testing plugins are now shipped with Cypress to enable easy `cy.mount()` implementation. Your local framework dependencies found in `node_modules` will be referenced to prevent adding additional dependencies or peer-dependencies to your `package.json`. From now on, the latest plugin version will be shipped with each Cypress release. See our [current support for frameworks and bundlers](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/component-testing/component-framework-configuration). Addressed in [#20930](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20930).\n        *   `@cypress/[[email protected]](https://docs.cypress.io/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)`\n        *   `@cypress/[[email protected]](https://docs.cypress.io/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)`\n        *   `@cypress/[[email protected]](https://docs.cypress.io/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)`\n        *   `@cypress/[[email protected]](https://docs.cypress.io/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)`\n*   We've enhanced how you can set and refresh **configuration** detailed below:\n    \n    *   Support for `cypress.config.js|ts|cjs|mjs` configuration files was added. Addressed in [#20643](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20643).\n    *   The Cypress app will now refresh when changes are made in the configuration file instead of closing the app. Addressed in [#21160](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/21160).\n*   We've added several **new configuration options** detailed below:\n    \n    *   The [`setupNodeEvents()`](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration#setupNodeEvents) option is a new testing type specific configuration option. It must be defined within the [`e2e`](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration#e2e) and/or [`component`](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration#component) configurations. This option allows you to modify your loaded configuration, listen to events and register plugins. This option replaces the `pluginsFile` option. Addressed in [#18798](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/18798) and [#20560](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20560).\n        \n    *   The [`devServer`](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration#devServer) option is a new component testing specific option that must be defined within the [`component`](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration#component) configuration. This option provides a mechanism for starting a component testing dev-server when tests are running.\n        \n    *   The `specPattern` option is a new testing-type specific configuration option that must be defined within the [`e2e`](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration#e2e) and/or [`component`](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration#component) configurations. This option accepts a glob or an array of globs of the spec files to load. This option simplifies the spec discovery by replacing the `componentFolder`, `integrationFolder` and `testFiles` options. Addressed in [#19319](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/19319), [#20565](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20565) and [#20853](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20853).\n        \n        *   The [`e2e.specPattern`](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration#e2e) default value for new projects is `cypress/e2e/**.cy.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}`. For existing projects, please run `cypress open` to have your spec files automatically migrated to match this `specPattern`. Addressed in [#21193](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/21193).\n        *   The [`component.specPattern`](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration#component) default value is `**/*.cy.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}`.\n    *   The `excludeSpecPattern` option is a new testing type specific configuration option that must be defined within the [`e2e`](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration#e2e) and/or [`component`](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration#component) configurations. This option accepts a glob or an array of globs which allows you to ignore spec files that would otherwise be shown in your list of specs. This option replaces the `ignoreTestFiles` option. Addressed in [#19319](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/19319), [#19980](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/19980), [#20763](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20763), [#20853](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20853).\n        \n        *   The [`e2e.excludeSpecPattern`](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration#e2e) default value is the same as the replaced `ignoreTestFiles` glob pattern of `*.hot-update.js`.\n        *   The [`component.excludeSpecPattern`](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration#component) default value is `['**/__snapshots__/*','**/__image_snapshots__/*']` plus the `e2e.specPattern` glob patterns.\n        *   The `**/node_modules/**` pattern is automatically added to both `e2e.excludeSpecPattern` and `component.excludeSpecPattern` and can't be overridden. This is consistent with <10.0 behavior.\n    *   Intelligent Code Completion was added with the `defineConfig()` helper function. This enables configuration auto-completion and in-line documentation in the configuration file in your IDE. While it's not strictly necessary for Cypress to parse your configuration, we recommend wrapping your config object with `defineConfig()`. Addressed in [#18302](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/18302).\n        \n*   We've made some updates to **Cypress API commands** detailed below:\n    \n    *   Enhancements were made to provide visual indication of nested commands and logs. With this change, users are now able to click on log groups to print additional log details to the dev tools console.\n        \n    *   The `.within()` command was updated to provide visual indication of logs and commands executed in the `.within` command context. Addresses [#20433](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/20433).\n        \n    *   The redundant `cy.session()` log is now removed. Address [#7673](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7673) in [#21457](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/21457).\n        \n    *   Users can now add custom `cy.hover()` and `cy.mount()` implementation using `Cypress.Commands.add()` since we don't provide a default implementation. Previously users had to use `Cypress.Command.override()` to provide the custom implementation. Addresses [#18941](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/18941).\n        \n*   We've made some updates to the **Cypress CLI** detailed below:\n    \n    *   You can now pass in testing type specific configuration options via the `--config` CLI flag without nesting JSON. Addressed in [#20127](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20127).\n        \n    *   New `--e2e` and `--component` CLI flags were added to `cypress run` and `cypress open` to allow a user to run or launch Cypress for a specific testing-type. If a testing-type specific CLI flag is not provided when running `cypress run`, Cypress will run end-to-end tests by default.\n        \n    *   A warning message is now displayed when `cypress open` is ran with the `--browser` CLI flag for a browser that does not exist on the system. Addressed in [#18473](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/18473).\n        \n    *   If a testing type and browser flag are passed to `cypress open` when launching a specific project, the browser will automatically launch. Addressed in [#21538](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/21538).\n        \n*   The `cypress open` experience has been updated to take you through our **Launchpad** with many features detailed below:\n    \n    *   When you launch Cypress via `cypress open` you'll be asked whether you want to do end-to-end or component testing and taken through the configuration necessary to set up your project. Addressed in [#18924](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/18924).\n        \n    *   Having files scaffolded on new projects during end-to-end testing is now opt in and not automatic. Addressed in [#18924](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/18924).\n        \n    *   When Cypress detects you have a `cypress.json` during `cypress run`, it will error and ask you to run `cypress open` to migrate. When Cypress detects you have a `cypress.json` during `cypress open`, it will guide you through project migration to ensure your project continues to work as expected. Addressed in [#18924](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/18924).\n        \n*   After launching the browser, there are several new features in our **App** detailed below:\n    \n    *   The Cypress app has been redesigned so that the Command Log and all associated navigation display with a dark background.\n    *   You can now change specs or the browser within the same window as running your tests.\n    *   Many git details are now shown within your current project in Cypress including the current branch and the last commit details of each spec in the spec explorer. Addressed in [#20648](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20648), [#21139](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/21139), [#21436](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/21436) and [#20744](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20744)\n    *   When creating a new spec within Cypress, your project's language is detected to provide the correct file extension and the `specPattern` is checked to ensure the spec is found by Cypress. After creating the spec, you can preview the spec that was generated with the option to immediately run the spec or create another spec. Addressed in [#21225](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/21225), [#20567](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20567), [#20657](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20657), [#20962](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20962).\n    *   The Settings page has been redesigned to more clearly distinguish between settings that are specific to the project, your device, and the Dashboard.\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   An error message is displayed when you add a command using `Cypress.Commands.add()` that has the same name as an internal reserved Cypress command. Addresses [#6146](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6146).\n*   A one pixel, left, vertical border was removed that was incorrectly included on screenshot artifacts generated from the `cy.screenshot()` command in component tests. Addressed in [#21019](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/21019).\n*   A memory leak was fixed during `cypress run` for end-to-end tests launched in Chromium and Firefox browsers that reduces the overall time it takes to run a set of specs and aligns with how the browser is launched once for all specs in component testing. With this change, the `before:browser:launch` node event will now properly only fire once per run, instead of firing before each spec. Addressed in [#19915](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/19915).\n*   The default webpack configuration's host value was changed from `localhost` to `127.0.0.1` to support the Node 17+ changes with how DNS names are resolved. Addressed in [#21430](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/21430).\n*   Cypress will throw a detailed error when some plugin versions are no longer supported in Cypress 10. Addressed in [#21169](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/21169)\n\n**Dependencies:**\n\n*   Added `@cypress/[[email protected]](https://docs.cypress.io/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)` dependency.\n*   Added `@cypress/[[email protected]](https://docs.cypress.io/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)` dependency.\n*   Added `@cypress/[[email protected]](https://docs.cypress.io/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)` dependency.\n*   Added `@cypress/[[email protected]](https://docs.cypress.io/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)` dependency.\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   The Plugins concept in Cypress still exists with the intent to tap into, modify or extend the internal behavior(s) of Cypress. It however is expected to be used in conjunction with our new `setupNodesEvents` configuration option, which was named to reflect that Plugins leverage Cypress's node events.\n\n## 9.7.0[​](#9-7-0 \"Direct link to 9.7.0\")\n\n_Released 5/23/2022_\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   The Electron version and shipped Chromium browser version has been updated. Addressed in [#21418](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/21418).\n\n**Deprecations:**\n\n*   The `Cypress.Cookies.preserveOnce()` and `Cypress.Cookies.defaults()` Cypress APIs have been deprecated. In a future release, support for `Cypress.Cookies.preserveOnce()` and `Cypress.Cookies.defaults()` will be removed. Consider using the experimental [`cy.session()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/session) command instead to cache and restore cookies and other sessions details between tests. Fixed [#21333](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/21333).\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Updated the [`cy.contains()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/contains) command to correctly error and retry if the provided regex pattern begins with an equal sign and a match was not initially found. Previously the command would incorrectly fail with a syntax error. Fixed [#21108](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/21108).\n*   Corrected the `cy.session()` command log grouping and validation verbiage. This change provides better insights to logs associated with the command. Fixed [#21377](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/21377).\n*   Removed `eventemitter2` third-party type definitions from `cy` and `Cypress` that were unintentionally exposed. Fixed [#20556](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/20556).\n\n**Dependency Updates:**\n\n*   Upgraded the bundled node version shipped with Cypress from `16.5.0` to `16.13.2`. Addressed in [#21418](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/21418).\n*   Upgraded the Chromium browser version used during `cypress run` and when selecting Electron browser in `cypress open` from `94.0.4606.81` to `100.0.4896.75`. Addressed in [#21418](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/21418).\n*   Upgraded `electron` dependency from `15.5.1` to `18.0.4`. Addressed in [#21418](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/21418).\n\n## 9.6.1[​](#9-6-1 \"Direct link to 9.6.1\")\n\n_Released 5/9/2022_\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Cypress can now launch on systems where Firefox is installed via Snapcraft. Fixed [#19793](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/19793).\n*   Updates were made to ensure XHR calls are properly displaying the response body in the command log. Fixed [#21361](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/21361).\n*   Fixed [`cy.contains()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/contains) and [`.should('contain', ...)`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/should) to handle finding text that contains backslash characters. Fixed [#19116](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/19116)\n*   Updated [`.type('{enter}')`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/type) to support sending the Enter keystroke to submit buttons that are not rendered within a form html element, but are associated with a form via the `form` attribute. Fixed [#21163](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/21163).\n*   Fixed an issue with `cy.session()` such that re-running tests in open mode will now correctly recreate a session. Before this change, an error was thrown indicating the saved `setup` function was not a function because it was serialized. Fixed [#17805](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/17805).\n\n## 9.6.0[​](#9-6-0 \"Direct link to 9.6.0\")\n\n_Released 4/25/2022_\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   Now you can easily test multi-domain workflows by using the experimental [`cy.origin()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/origin) command. This feature allows you to test across different origins or domains within a single test. This experiment was designed to work side-by-side with the [`cy.session()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/session) experimental feature. You can turn on use of this command by setting the [`experimentalSessionAndOrigin`](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/experiments) configuration option to `true`. For more details, read [our blog post](https://cypress.io/blog/2022/04/25/cypress-9-6-0-easily-test-multi-domain-workflows-with-cy-origin/). Addressed [#17336](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/17336) and [#944](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/944).\n    *   Added a new configuration option called `experimentalSessionAndOrigin`. This option enables support for [`cy.session()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/session) and [`cy.origin()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/origin) for end-to-end testing.\n    *   The `experimentalSessionSupport` configuration option has been removed and replaced by the `experimentalSessionAndOrigin` configuration option. Please update your configuration to use the new `experimentalSessionAndOrigin` option to continue to opt-in to this experimental feature.\n    *   When `experimentalSessionAndOrigin` is enabled, cross-origin requests will no longer immediately fail, but instead, time out based on the [`pageLoadTimeout`](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration#Timeouts) configuration. This allows the request to be appropriately handled by the [`cy.origin()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/origin) command.\n    *   When `experimentalSessionAndOrigin` is enabled, Cypress will no longer wait on page loads between hooks before moving on to the next test.\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Fixed an issue with Firefox 98+ where the Enter keystroke was not being sent to an input element when using [`.type('{enter}')`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/type). Fixed [#21033](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/21033).\n*   We now verify if an interruption while running tests was signaled by the user or if it came from an error in a plugin before showing the error message. Fixed [#21010](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/21010).\n*   Improved the error message observed on Windows platforms when unzipping the Cypress binary and the max file length is exceeded. Fixed in [#21047](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/21047).\n*   Updated the `Cypress.Commands.add()` TypeScript types to better reflect the attributes of the `.add()` utility and the JQuery element, a possible previous subject type. [#20376](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/20376).\n\n**Dependency Updates:**\n\n*   Upgraded `electron` dependency from `15.3.5` to `15.5.1` to consume fixes related to [improve performance](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/33406) on macOS Big Sur and later. Addressed [#21068](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/21068).\n\n## 9.5.4[​](#9-5-4 \"Direct link to 9.5.4\")\n\n_Released 4/11/2022_\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Updates were made to silence Electron warnings related to being unable to connect to dbus. These errors are normal and expected, and do not result in test failures. Because they are always present when running Electron inside docker containers, it has incorrectly led people to believe it is the root-cause of an error within their test run. By silencing these errors, it will improve the debug experience to allow users to focus on meaningful warning and error messages. Fixed [#19299](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/19299).\n*   Updates were made to ensure that all `*.enable` events are sent if Cypress becomes disconnected from the Chrome DevTools Protocol and must re-establish a connection to ensure all command logs are displayed to the user. This fixes an issue where some command logs, like download or network events, are missing once Cypress has disconnected and then reconnected to the Chrome DevTools Protocol. Fixed [#20618](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/20618).\n*   Fixed an issue where `cy.type('{enter}')` was not sending the Enter key for Firefox `v98+`. This was not an issue with Firefox `v97` and below. Fixed [#20562](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/20562).\n*   Fixed a regression in [9.3.0](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/changelog#9-3-0) where glob patterns provided to the `--spec` CLI parameter was incorrectly splitting the patterns in unexpected places when it should have split on commas. Fixes [#20794](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/20794).\n*   Fixed an issue with `cy.root()` to respect the [`timeout`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/root#Arguments) option passed to the command. Previously, when the `timeout` option was provided, it was ignored and the default timeout was used. Fixed [#19985](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/19985).\n*   Updates were made to decrease the length of the Cypress cache path for Windows to ensure [installing pre-release versions](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/advanced-installation#Install-pre-release-version) of the Cypress binary are within the maximum path length of 260 characters. Fixed in [#20961](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20961).\n*   Fixed a regression in [8.6.0](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/changelog#8-6-0) which prevented `.pause()` from correctly executing when passing the `--headed --no-exit` CLI flags to `cypress run`. Fixed [#20745](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/20745).\n*   Fixed a regression in [9.2.0](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/changelog#9-2-0) which would sometimes throw an expected error on navigation with `cy.back()` and `cy.go()`. Fixed [#19749](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/19749) and [#20539](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/20539).\n*   Corrected the TypeScript type for a cookie which was incorrectly typed as `any` when the correct type is `Cookie`. Fixed in [#20513](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20513).\n*   Added the missing `Cypress.Command.addAll()` TypeScript types. Fixed [#18886](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/18886).\n*   Fixed an uncommon error observed in `cy.session()` where an error was thrown when no cookies had been set for the session and the user clicks the session command log to view additional details in the DevTools console. Fixed in [#20946](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20946).\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   A minor visual update was made to the `cy.session()` command log visuals. Fixed [#20433](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/20433).\n\n**Dependency Updates:**\n\n*   Upgraded `ansi-regex` dependency from `4.1.0` to `4.1.1` to address the [CVE-2021-3807](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-3807) NVD security vulnerability. Addressed in [#20807](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20807).\n*   Upgraded `plist` dependency from `3.0.4` to `3.0.5` to address the [CVE-2022-22912](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-22912) NVD security vulnerability. Addressed in [#20808](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20808).\n\n## 9.5.3[​](#9-5-3 \"Direct link to 9.5.3\")\n\n_Released 3/28/2022_\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Corrected a logging issue with `cy.intercept()` where the response status code and response body were sometimes missing from the log details in `open` mode. Fixed [#18757](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/18757).\n*   Fixed an issue in `cy.readFile()` where the command would not retry or provide a meaningful error message if `null` encoding was used and the file was not found. Fixed [#20683](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/20683).\n*   Updated the Cypress Keyboard shortcuts to only run the shortcut when the pressed shortcut key was not used in conjunction with either the `alt`, `ctrl`, or `shift` modifier keys. This fixed an issue where the Cypress shortcut handler would override the browser native keyboard shortcut for search (`ctrl + f`). Fixed [#20222](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/20222).\n*   Updates were made to correctly escape dollar signs in the `CYPRESS_DOWNLOAD_PATH_TEMPLATE` environment variable. Issues were seen utilizing this template when the env was provided from a package manager file. Fixed [#19914](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/19914).\n*   Fix the `Cypress.Buffer` TypeScript type to reference the static constructor of `Buffer`, instead of incorrectly referencing the `Buffer` instance which caused Type errors. Fixes [#20542](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/20542).\n\n**Dependency Updates:**\n\n*   Upgraded `electron` dependency from `15.3.4` to `15.3.5` to address the [CVE-2022-21718](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-21718) NVD security vulnerability. Addressed in [#20750](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/20750).\n*   Upgraded `minimist` dependency from `1.2.5` to `1.2.6`. Addressed in [#20756](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/20756).\n*   Upgraded `nanoid` dependency from `3.1.20` to `3.1.31` to address the [CVE-2021-23566](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-23566) NVD security vulnerability. Addressed in [#20726](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20726).\n*   Upgraded `node-forge` dependency from `1.0.0` to `1.3.0` to address the [CVE-2022-24771](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24771) NVD security vulnerability. Addressed in [#20727](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20727).\n\n## 9.5.2[​](#9-5-2 \"Direct link to 9.5.2\")\n\n_Released 3/14/2022_\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Fixed an issue with `.type()` where click events could be fired on the incorrect target element because the target focus changed within a key-down event handler callback. Fixed in [#20525](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20525).\n*   Fixed a regression in [9.5.0](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/changelog#9-5-0) where ANSI colors were not removed from the FireFox warning message about the `chromeWebSecurity` configuration option having no effect on the Firefox browser. Fixes [#20496](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/20496).\n*   Updates were made to the pre-release build setup such that Cypress will use a unique cache folder for each [pre-release installation](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/advanced-installation#Install-pre-release-version) on a machine. This removes the need to run `cypress clear cache` before installing a new pre-release version of Cypress or before installing a new released version of Cypress after a pre-release version had been installed. Addressed in [#20296](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20296).\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   Updates were made to explicitly disable the `Origin-Agent-Cluster` header for proxied responses to ensure `document.domain` can continue to be set with Chrome v106+. This was necessary because Chrome is planning to make [`document.domain` immutable](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/immutable-document-domain/) in v106+ to relax the same-origin policy by interpreting the `Origin-Agent-Cluster` as `true`, whereas it is currently interpreted as `false`. Addresses [#20147](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/20147).\n\n**Dependency Updates:**\n\n*   Upgraded `url-parse` dependency from `1.5.6` to `1.5.9` to address these NVD security vulnerabilities, [CVE-2022-0639](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-0639), [CVE-2022-0686](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-0686) and [CVE-2022-0691](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-0691). Addressed in [#20386](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20386) and [#20439](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/20439).\n\n## 9.5.1[​](#9-5-1 \"Direct link to 9.5.1\")\n\n_Released 2/28/2022_\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Added a `ready` event to the Plugins process to ensure all plugins have successfully started before the configuration is loaded and the tests start. Fixed in [#19792](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/19792).\n    *   This fixes an issue where the plugin is never executed and leaves Cypress stuck in the initialization phase, where the user can only view the loading spinner.\n    *   This enables support for node's experimental `--loader` flag for plugins.\n*   Made a change to the DNS lookup to improve test performances and reliability on MacOS machines that leverage the VMWare CBCloud SaaS solution. Before this change, random test failures were observed, as well as hanging tests and initially pending HTTP and HTTPS responses. Fixed in [#20062](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/20062).\n*   Fixed a regression in [9.5.0](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/changelog#9-5-0) where ANSI colors were not removed from the `cy.fixtures()` error code frame. Fixes [#20208](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/20208).\n*   Fixed a regression in [9.5.0](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/changelog#9-5-0) where the test config override errors were formatted incorrectly. Fixes [#20208](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/20208).\n*   Fixed an issue where Cypress would throw an error when reporting or wrapping errors with booleans or numbers. Fixes [#19561](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/19561).\n\n**Dependency Updates:**\n\n*   Upgraded `url-parse` dependency from `1.5.2` to `1.5.6` to avoid authorization bypass through user-controlled key to address this [NVD security vulnerability](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-0512). Addressed in [#20270](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/20270).\n\n## 9.5.0[​](#9-5-0 \"Direct link to 9.5.0\")\n\n_Released 2/15/2022_\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   Enhancements were made to the error experience in both run mode and open mode to improve readability and provide meaningful stack traces. Addressed in [#20124](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/20124).\n*   Updated the `cy.request()` log message to hide the origin when it matched the browser origin to make debugging easier. This reduces the length of the log message that could be partially hidden if a long url is requested. Addressed in [#20009](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/20009).\n*   Updates were made to log the `ShadowRoot` and `Document` elements as HTML elements. Previously these would be logged as enumerated objects, which were difficult to evaluate. Addressed in [#20049](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/20049).\n*   Updated the terminal output generated in Cypress run mode to de-emphasis the `node` path in the run header. Addressed in [#20120](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/20120).\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Fixed an issue where files attached during `.selectFile()` could have the wrong `File` prototype. Fixes [#20003](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/20003).\n*   Updated `.select()` to only dispatch the `change` and `input` events when the selected option is not the currently selected option. This change aligns `.select()` with the browser. Fixes [#19494](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/19494).\n*   Updated `.type(' ')` to align with the W3C standards where a click event should be dispatched when the Space key is pressed and the current focus is on a state-changing element with type `button`, `image`, `submit` or `reset`. Fixes [#20067](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/20067).\n\n## 9.4.1[​](#9-4-1 \"Direct link to 9.4.1\")\n\n_Released 1/31/2022_\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Fixed a regression in [9.4.0](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/changelog#9-4-0) where the line endings in the public npm package prevented some users from running Cypress. Fixes [#19986](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/19986).\n\n## 9.4.0[​](#9-4-0 \"Direct link to 9.4.0\")\n\n_Released 1/31/2022_\n\n**Features**\n\n*   Enhancements were made to `.selectFile()` after receiving feedback after its initial release in [9.3.0](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/changelog#9-3-0).\n    *   The default behavior was updated to automatically infer the mime type of files based on their extension to correctly encode file uploads. Addressed in [#19751](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/19751).\n    *   Added the `mimeType` property so you can explicitly set the mime type on files using the `mimeType` property. Addressed in [#19751](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/19751).\n    *   Updated file contents types to allow either a [`TypedArray`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/TypedArray) instance or a `Cypress.Buffer` instance, where previously file contents were expected to only be an instance of `Cypress.Buffer`. Addressed in [#19751](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/19751).\n    *   Updated `.selectFile()` to retain the fileName of files read from disk to work with aliases. Addressed in [#19803](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/19803).\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Fixed a regression in [9.3.0](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/changelog#9-3-0) to correctly parse the `--spec` CLI parameter for glob patterns containing a range. Fixes [#19783](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/19783).\n*   Fixed regression in [9.2.1](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/changelog#9-1-1) where the `--openssl-legacy-provider` flag was not being passed to the plugins' child process when the user's system Node version was Node 17+ built with OpenSSL v3+ which resulted in Cypress crashing when trying to run tests. Fixes [#19712](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/19712).\n*   Update `.type('{enter}')` to align with the W3C standards where a click event should be dispatched when the Enter key is pressed and the current focus is on a state-changing element with type `button`, `image`, `submit` or `reset`. Fixes [#19541](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/19541).\n\n## 9.3.1[​](#9-3-1 \"Direct link to 9.3.1\")\n\n_Released 1/19/2022_\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Fixed an issue where the bin file was released with windows line breaks. Fixes [#19747](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/19747).\n\n## 9.3.0[​](#9-3-0 \"Direct link to 9.3.0\")\n\n_Released 1/18/2022_\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   Added a new Cypress command, called [`.selectFile()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/selectfile), to select a file or files in an HTML5 input element or simulate dragging a file or files into the browser. The API is similar to `cypress-file-upload` and we have provided a [migration guide](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/migration-guide#Migrating-from-cypress-file-upload-to-selectFile) for previous users of that plugin. For more details, see [our blog post](https://cypress.io/blog/2022/01/18/uploading-files-with-selectfile/). Fixes [#19524](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/19524) and [#170](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/170).\n*   Exposed the `Buffer` polyfill, as [`Cypress.Buffer`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/utilities/buffer), to enable working with binary data. Addressed in [#19524](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/19524).\n*   Added the `CYPRESS_DOWNLOAD_PATH_TEMPLATE` environment variable which can be set to a string template for building the download URL for the Cypress binary. This environment variable is useful for users who are downloading the Cypress binary from a proxy that is not one-to-one with the Cypress's default download url. More information can be found in the [Install Binary](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/advanced-installation#Install-binary) documentation. Fixes [#15697](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/15697).\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Fixed an issue where the `--spec` CLI parameter was not working properly when passing multiple glob patterns that are separated by commas. Fixes [#16102](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/16102).\n*   Fixed an issue with how the `CYPRESS_VERIFY_TIMEOUT` environment variable was read so it can set in a project's `package.json` or its `.npmrc`. Fixes [#19559](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/19559).\n\n**Dependency Updates:**\n\n*   Upgraded `graceful-fs` from `4.2.0` to `4.2.9`. This upgrade resolves issues observed with using graceful-fs v4.2.0 with resolve v1.21+. Addressed in [#19676](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/19676) and resolves [#19610](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/19610).\n    *   **NOTE:** This upgrade to `graceful-fs` breaks Cypress's compatibility with Yarn 2. We have observed errors with Yarn 2.4.2 with `graceful-fs` 4.2.9. Before this change, Cypress had minimal Yarn 2 support (see [#6377](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6377)). Between Yarn 3 fixing multiple bugs and the migration path from Yarn 2 to Yarn 3 being minimal, we felt the best step forward was to support and recommend Yarn 3 over Yarn 2.\n*   Upgraded `electron` from `15.2.0` to `15.3.4`. Addressed in [#19351](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/19351).\n\n## 9.2.1[​](#9-2-1 \"Direct link to 9.2.1\")\n\n_Released 1/10/2022_\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Fixed a regression in [9.2.0](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/changelog#9-2-0) to keep Cypress open after each spec finishes when the `--headed --no-exit` flags are passed to `cypress run`. Fixes [#19485](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/19485).\n*   Improve heuristic for verifying when the `--openssl-legacy-provider` option should be passed to the plugins' child process when the system Node version is v17+. This prevents Cypress from crashing when a user has Node 17 installed which was built with OpenSSL v1. Fixes [#19320](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/19320).\n*   Correctly cast the `CYPRESS_VERIFY_TIMEOUT` environment variable as a number so Cypress will no longer throw `TypeError: Expected the timeout option to be a non-negative integer`. Fixes [#19476](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/19476).\n\n**Dependency Updates:**\n\n*   Update pinned resolution of `cli-table3` from `~0.6.0` to `~0.6.1` to avoid problems with the bug introduced in the [colors.js v1.4.44-liberty-2 release](https://github.com/Marak/colors.js/issues/285). Addresses [#19624](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/19624).\n\n## 9.2.0[​](#9-2-0 \"Direct link to 9.2.0\")\n\n_Released 12/20/2021_\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   Cypress will throw an error when a user attempts to update a configuration value at run-time using either the Test Configuration or using `Cypress.config()` that is a [readonly option](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration#Test-Configuration). Addresses [#6407](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6407) and [#19001](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/19001).\n*   A `timeout` option has been added to the `cy.writeFile()` command, with a default value of `defaultCommandTimeout`. Addresses [#3350](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3350).\n*   The default `maxHttpBufferSize` for the internal socket server has been increased to [Node's maximum Buffer size](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#bufferconstantsmax_length) (size varies by OS) to allow large file writes with `cy.writeFile()`. Addresses [#19140](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/19140).\n*   Add `CYPRESS_VERIFY_TIMEOUT` environment variable to override the timeout duration of the `verify` command. Addresses [#18290](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/18290).\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Prevent unnecessary snapshotting when running default assertions that would unnecessarily increase CPU use in `cypress open` mode which lead to out of memory crashes on certain browsers. Fixes [#18549](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/18549).\n*   Removed automatic retries for failed HTTP requests through the proxy. This fixes an issue where failed requests could be re-sent too many times in some conditions. This change could increase the number of failed requests that your app sees. Fixes [#19043](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/19043).\n*   Reduced the occurrence of an issue where logs for `fetch` and `xhr` requests could be associated with the wrong request. Fixes [#19043](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/19043).\n*   Tests that are skipped within `then` blocks will no longer throw errors causing the test to fail. Tests that are skipped outside of `then` blocks will no longer trigger the fail event. This will prevent screenshots from happening from errors thrown by the fail event. Fixes [#14867](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14867) and [#17660](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/17660).\n*   Fixed a regression in [9.0.0](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/changelog#9-0-0) where a fixture provided in a static response to `cy.intercept()` did not support passing `null` to encoding to read the fixture as a Buffer. This identified an undocumented 9.0.0 Breaking Change where the default read behavior of a fixture changed from a Buffer to being read with `utf8` encoding. Fixes [#19344](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/19344).\n*   Fixed a regression in [9.0.0](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/changelog#9-0-0) where `cy.contains()` attempted to ignore `<script>` and `<style>` elements found within `<body>`. by deleting them from the dom. This behavior was corrected to ignore the elements without deleting them. Fixes [#19377](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/19377).\n*   Cypress will no longer crash when proxying an ill formed request. For example, if the application under test has a resource of `\"http: //localhost/asset.js\"` (notice the extraneous space), Cypress will now log a debug message and the asset will fail to load. Fixes [#9220](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9220).\n*   Correct `Cypress.Command.add()` and `Cypress.Command.override()` TypeScript types. Fixes [#18879](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/18879), [#19095](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/19095) and [#18940](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/18940).\n    *   Custom command implementations typings take into account `prevSubject` variants.\n    *   Custom command implementations now allows to NOT return a value.\n    *   Custom command overwrites typings take into account `originalFn` function.\n*   Add types for `Cypress.session.clearAllSavedSessions()`. Fixes [#19363](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/19363).\n\n**Dependencies:**\n\n*   Upgraded `ssri` from `6.0.1` to `6.0.2` to mitigate [ssri vulnerability](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:ssri@6.0.1). Addressed in [#19351](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/19351).\n\n## 9.1.1[​](#9-1-1 \"Direct link to 9.1.1\")\n\n_Released 12/03/2021_\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Fixed a regression in [9.1.0](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/changelog#9-1-0) where our built binary didn't contain patches to some dependencies. Addressed in [#19239](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/19239). This fixed some issues including:\n    *   Requests containing `~` will no longer be improperly encoded. Fixes [#19083](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/19083), [#19084](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/19084), [#19115](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/19115), [#19096](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/19096), [#19178](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/19178).\n    *   A TypeError displaying `data.hasOwnProperty is not a function` will no longer throw in some situations. Fixes [#19091](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/19091).\n    *   Empty extra hooks will no longer be sent as data when recording to the Dashboard. Fixes [#19087](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/19087).\n    *   The Runner hanging when baseUrl is set to null to load a local file. Fixes [#19105](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/19105)\n*   When using the default configuration of `\"nodeVersion\": \"system\"` with an installed system node >=17, Cypress will now work properly rather than throw an error incorrectly pointing to the user's plugin file. Fixes [#18914](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/18914).\n*   Shadow DOM elements no longer error as hidden during actionability when the element is covered by its parent shadow root. Fixes [#18008](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/18008).\n*   When using `.type()` events now correctly propagate out of the shadow DOM. Fixes [#17531](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/17531).\n*   The `this` context is now properly preserved when overwriting `cy.clock()`. Fixes [#19158](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/19158).\n\n**Dependencies:**\n\n*   Upgraded `@cypress/request` from `2.88.7` to `2.88.10`. Addressed in [#19099](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/19099).\n\n## 9.1.0[​](#9-1-0 \"Direct link to 9.1.0\")\n\n_Released 11/22/2021_\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   A `CYPRESS` environment variable will be set to true in child processes where Cypress runs user code in Node.js. You can now detect that you're running in Cypress by looking for `process.env.CYPRESS`. Addresses [#18805](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/18805).\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Specs with % in the filename will no longer fail to load and now behave as any other spec. Fixes [#18871](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/18871).\n*   When using the Selector Playground, the HTML attribute's value will be wrapped in double-quotes. Fixes [#1884](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1884).\n*   The call count is now shown in the Command Log when using `cy.stub().log(false)`. Fixes [#18907](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/18907).\n*   The warning message for retrying connection to a browser has been improved to indicate when it is still waiting. Fixes [#18644](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/18644).\n*   Cypress commands that rely on `this` context now have access to `this` when overridden. Fixes [#18899](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/18899).\n*   Test configuration is now correctly applied when using `only`. Fixes [#18959](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/18959).\n\n## 9.0.0[​](#9-0-0 \"Direct link to 9.0.0\")\n\n_Released 11/10/2021_\n\n**Breaking Changes:**\n\n*   The `nodeVersion` configuration option now defaults to `system`. The behavior of the `system` option has changed to always use the Node.js binary/version that launched Cypress. If Cypress was not launched via the terminal, Cypress will use the `bundled` Node.js version. This could change the behavior of code within your `pluginsFile` since it may be run in your `system` Node.js version. Addresses [#18684](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/18684).\n*   Windows 32-bit is no longer supported in Cypress. Addresses [#17962](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/17962).\n*   An error will now be thrown if an invalid value is passed to `Cypress.config`. Previously invalid values were ignored and could cause unexpected behavior. Addresses [#18589](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/18589).\n*   `cy.contains()` no longer yields the `<body>` element when it matches the content of `<script>` or `<style>` tags. Addresses [#14861](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14861).\n*   Attempting to add an existing built-in Cypress command using `Cypress.Commands.add()` will now throw an error, indicating that `Cypress.Commands.overwrite()` should be used instead to overwrite the behavior of existing commands. Addresses [#18572](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/18572).\n*   Custom command implementations are now typed based on the declared custom chainables. Addresses [#17496](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/17496).\n*   The bundled Node.js version was upgraded from `14.17.0` to `16.5.0`. This could change the behavior of code within the `pluginsFile` when using the bundled Node.js version of Cypress. Addressed in [#18317](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/18317).\n*   The default read behavior of a fixture provided as a static response in `cy.intercept()` changed from being read as a Buffer to using `utf8` encoding. This aligns the default read behavior of `cy.intercept()` to `cy.readFile()` and `cy.fixture()`. Addresses [#18534](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/18534).\n\n**Deprecations:**\n\n*   The `nodeVersion` configuration option has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release.\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   When `null` is passed as the encoding to `cy.readFile()` or `cy.fixture()`, the file is treated as binary and read as a Buffer. Similarly, `null` passed as the encoding to `cy.writeFile()` allows direct writing of buffers. If the encoding is unspecified, the default remains `utf8`, matching the current behavior. Addresses [#18534](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/18534).\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Sticky elements within a fixed container will now be able to be properly scrolled to during action commands. Fixes [#4233](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4233).\n*   `document.referrer` will now correctly reflect the correct value from the application under test after `cy.visit()`. Fixes [#4295](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4295).\n\n**Dependencies:**\n\n*   Upgraded Chrome browser version used during `cypress run` and when selecting Electron browser in `cypress open` from `91` to `94`. Addressed in [#15292](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/18317).\n*   Upgraded bundled Node.js version from `14.17.0` to `16.5.0`. Addressed in [#15292](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/18317).\n*   Upgraded `electron` from `14.1.0` to `15.2.0`. Addressed in [#15292](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/18317).\n\n## 8.7.0[​](#8-7-0 \"Direct link to 8.7.0\")\n\n_Released 10/25/2021_\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   There are changes to how \"slow\" tests are determined and displayed in Cypress. Addresses [#18496](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/18496).\n    *   Added a [`slowTestThreshold`](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration#Timeouts) configuration option to customize when tests are considered \"slow\" during `cypress run`. A test that runs slower than the given threshold will display in orange text in the default 'spec' reporter. This configuration can be set in your Cypress config file or via specific [test configuration](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/writing-and-organizing-tests#Test-Configuration).\n    *   The default slow test threshold was changed from 75ms (Mocha's default) to 10000ms for e2e tests and 250ms for component tests. To restore the old behavior, you can add `\"slowTestThreshold\": 75` to your Cypress config file.\n    *   All tests will show the time the test ran in milliseconds during `cypress run` with the default 'spec' reporter.\n*   Users can pass an `overwrite: true` option to `Cypress.Screenshot.defaults` to change default behavior to overwrite existing screenshots without having to set `overwrite` for each `cy.screenshot()` command. Addresses [#7955](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7955).\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Fixed a regression introduced in [8.6.0](#8-6-0) where videos recorded in Electron to the Dashboard were not playable in the Firefox or Safari browser and were not compatible with QuickTime player in MacOS.\n*   Fixed a regression introduced in [8.6.0](#8-6-0) so that the warning about the `projectRoot` directory not being writeable will now display correctly. Fixes [#18485](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/18485).\n*   Improved the error message when running Cypress without non-root permissions. Fixes [#18445](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/18445).\n*   An error now throws when invalid options are passed to the `selectorPriority` configuration option of `Cypress.SelectorPlayground.defaults`. Valid values are `data-*`, `id`, `class`, `tag`, `attribute`, or `nth-child`. Fixes [#7745](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7745).\n\n**Dependency Updates:**\n\n*   Pinned resolution of `ua-parser-js` to `0.7.24` to avoid dependency resolution to the compromised package versions. Please read the [security advisory](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-pjwm-rvh2-c87w) and take actions advised as soon as possible. Addressed in [#18611](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/18611)\n\n## 8.6.0[​](#8-6-0 \"Direct link to 8.6.0\")\n\n_Released 10/11/2021_\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   `cy.screenshot()` now accepts `overwrite: true` as an option to overwrite existing screenshots with the same file name. Addresses [#7955](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7955).\n*   `cy.select([])` can now be used to clear any selected options in a multi-value select. Addresses [#4318](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4318).\n*   Using `cy.pause()` when using `cypress run --headed --no-exit` will now pause a test. Addresses [#4044](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4044).\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Fixed a regression introduced in [8.2.0](#8-2-0) where certain XMLHttpRequests would not display their response bodies in the DevTools Console when clicked. Fixes [#17656](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/17656).\n*   Fixed a regression in [8.3.0](#8-3-0) where capturing videos in Chrome versions earlier than 89 would result in choppy videos and skipped frames. Fixes [#18021](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/18021).\n*   Cypress displays the correct error when certain custom error types are thrown within a test. Fixes [#18259](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/18259).\n*   The Cypress App will no longer crash when passed a `--spec: {}` from the CLI and instead error when passed an invalid object argument. Fixes [#3957](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3957).\n*   Logging a plain object no longer results in the error \"Cannot convert object to primitive value\". Fixes [#18143](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/18143).\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   Updated the `cy.request()` error message when conflicting `failOnStatusCode` and `retryOnStatusCodeFailure` options are passed to be clearer. Fixes [#18271](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/18271).\n\n**Dependency Updates:**\n\n*   Upgraded the Chromium browser version used during `cypress run` and when selecting Electron browser in `cypress open` from `91.0.4472.164` to `93.0.4577.58`.\n*   Upgraded `electron` from `13.2.0` to `14.1.0`. Addressed in [#18318](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/18318) and [#18384](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/18384).\n\n## 8.5.0[​](#8-5-0 \"Direct link to 8.5.0\")\n\n_Released 09/27/2021_\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   You can now select an option by index within the [`.select()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/select) command. Addresses [#757](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/757).\n*   Cypress now captures the repository URL on Drone CI. Addresses [#18210](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/18210).\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   The download of Cypress now respects the `NO_PROXY` environment variable when one is set. Fixes [#17702](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/17702).\n*   When using a custom config file and setting it up to record to the Dashboard, Cypress now writes the `projectId` in the custom config file instead of `cypress.json`. Fixes [#5747](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5747).\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   Windows 32-bit has been deprecated and support will be removed in a later release. A deprecation warning will now display when using Cypress in a Windows 32-bit OS. See [#17962](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/17962) for more detail. Addresses [#18094](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/18094).\n*   Improved the error messages when an invalid argument type is passed to the [`.select()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/select) command. Addressed in [#18234](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/18234).\n\n## 8.4.1[​](#8-4-1 \"Direct link to 8.4.1\")\n\n_Released 09/17/2021_\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Cypress will no longer crash when setting up a project to record to the Dashboard or viewing the runs or record key for a previously set up project. Fixes [#18129](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/18129).\n*   The branch collected for Drone CI now correctly reflects the source PR branch for showing in the Cypress Dashboard.

Today's release includes a brand new test runner designed to replace your Node-based component tests. Our Component Test Runner tests your components in the browser, just like a user would. And, since it runs in the browser, you get to debug your components using your favorite developer tools. Read our [Component Testing Guide](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/component-testing/overview) for more details.\n\n**Breaking Changes:**\n\nPlease read our [Migration Guide](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/migration-guide) which explains the changes in more detail and how to change your code to migrate to Cypress 7.0.\\*\\*\n\n*   We introduced several breaking changes to [cy.intercept()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/intercept). See the [cy.intercept()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/intercept) docs for full usage examples. Breaking changes:\n    *   Request handlers supplied to `cy.intercept()` are now matched starting with the most recently defined request interceptor. This allows users to override request handlers by calling `cy.intercept()` again. This matches the previous behavior that was default in `cy.route()`. Addresses [#9302](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9302).\n    *   `cy.intercept()` now automatically parses more JSON MIME types, including 'application/vnd.api+json'. You can now remove `JSON.parse(req.body)` or `JSON.parse(res.body)` from some tests that previously required it. Addresses [#14763](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14763).\n    *   Falsy values (with the exception of `undefined`) supplied as the body of a `StaticResponse` to `cy.intercept()` will now be JSONified and sent as the body. Previously, an empty string was sent instead. Addresses [#15234](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/15234) and [#14205](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14205).\n    *   The `matchUrlAgainstPath` `RouteMatcher` property has been removed from `cy.intercept()`.\n    *   The \"substring match\" from `cy.intercept()` URL matching has been removed. Previously, a URL would match if it contained the supplied string anywhere. Now, the URL (including querystring) only matches if it is an equality match or a minimatch.\n    *   `res.delay()` and `res.throttle()` have been renamed to `res.setDelay()` and `res.setThrottle()`, respectively. Addresses [#15700](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/15700).\n    *   `cy.route2()` was previously aliased to `cy.intercept()`. Now the alias `cy.route2()` has been removed. Please update usage of `cy.route2()` to `cy.intercept()`. Addressed in [#14709](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/14709).\n*   Component tests have been migrated to use a dedicated test runner and are bundled differently. See the [Migration Guide](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/migration-guide#Component-Testing) for full examples on how to migrate. Addressed in [#14479](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/14479).\n    *   Component tests will not be executed when running `cypress open` or `cypress run`. Now, they need to be executed by running `cypress open-ct` or `cypress run-ct`. Addressed in [#15701](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/15701).\n    *   `experimentalComponentTesting` must be removed from your configuration file, `cypress.json` by default, or it will throw an error. Addressed in [#15701](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/15701).\n    *   The `file:preprocessor` event is no longer used to compile component tests. Now, a `dev-server:start` event must be registered.\n*   Cypress now catches uncaught errors and fails the test even if the application under test has defined `window.onerror`. Addresses [#8802](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/8802).\n*   Cypress now fails tests if there is an unhandled promise rejection in the application under test. Unhandled rejections will trigger the `uncaught:exception` event with the promise as the third argument. Addresses [#243](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/243).\n*   Cypress now throws an error if the application under test redirects more than 20 times. The number of times allowed to redirect is configurable via the [`redirectionLimit`](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration#Global) config. Addresses [#14445](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14445).\n*   The default preprocessor now targets a more modern version of ECMAScript. Addressed in [#15274](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/15274).\n*   We now enable [`contextIsolation`](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/context-isolation) by default in the Electron browser. You can override this option if needed within the `before:browser:launch` API. Addressed in [#15493](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/15493).\n*   `Cypress.moment()` has been removed. Please migrate to a different datetime formatter. See [our recipe](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-example-recipes/tree/master/examples/blogs__dayjs) for example replacements. Addresses [#8714](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8714).\n*   The bundled Node.js version was upgraded from `12.18.3` to `14.16.0`. This could change the behavior of code within the `pluginsFile` when using the [bundled Node.js version](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/legacy-configuration#Node-version) of Cypress. Addressed in [#15292](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/15292).\n*   Installing Cypress on your system now requires Node.js 12+. Addresses [#9545](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9545).\n*   The default headless browser window size has been increased to 1920x1080 pixels to capture [High-definition videos and screenshots](https://www.cypress.io/blog/2021/03/01/generate-high-resolution-videos-and-screenshots/). Addresses [#15752](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/15752), [#15730](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/15730), and [#15481](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/15481).\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   A command log entry is now displayed when there is an uncaught exception or unhandled rejection. Addresses [#8236](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8236).\n*   We added several features to [cy.intercept()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/intercept). See the [cy.intercept()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/intercept) docs for full usage examples. Addressed in [#14543](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/14543). New features:\n    *   There are new events on the req object for `cy.intercept()` including `before:response`, `response`, and `after:response`.\n    *   Response handlers (supplied via event handlers or via `req.continue(cb)`) supplied to `cy.intercept()` will be called in reverse order until `res.send` is called or until there are no more response handlers.\n    *   A new option, `middleware`, has been added to the `RouteMatcher` type. If true, the supplied request handler will be called before any non-middleware request handlers.\n    *   A new function, `req.continue(cb)`, is available on request objects yielded by `cy.intercept()`. It is functionally the same as `req.reply(cb)` - the request will stop propagating to other event handlers, will be sent outgoing, and the response will be handled by cb.\n    *   `cy.intercept()` can now be called with a new overload: `cy.intercept(url, routeMatcher, handler)`. `routeMatcher` will be merged with `url`, and the handler is required.\n*   [`cy.visit()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/visit) can now visit pages with `application/xhtml*` content-type. Addresses [#15738](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/15738).\n*   You can now pass runner specific configuration in order to pass different configuration values to `component` tests versus `e2e` tests. Addressed in [#15526](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/15526).\n*   There's a new keyboard shortcut (`ctrl/cmd + f`) to search spec files in the Test Runner based on your OS. Addresses [#6229](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6229).\n*   You can now create a new spec file directly from the Test Runner in the Desktop. Addressed in [#15335](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/15335).\n*   [`cy.tick()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/tick) now accepts a `log` option. Addresses [#15180](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/15180).\n*   The Cypress proxy now adds a `keep-alive` header to all proxy responses. Addressed in [#15292](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/15292)\n*   Cypress no longer forces specific `NODE_OPTIONS`. Addressed in [#15292](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/15292)\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   The `response.body` of [`cy.intercept()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/intercept) is now correct after stubbing a response using `res.send({ fixture })` in a `req.continue` callback or a `before:response` or `response` handler. Addressed in [#14543](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/14543).\n*   Fixed an issue where only the first matching alias for a route would yield a response object on [`cy.wait()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/wait). Fixes [#14522](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14522).\n*   [`.click()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/click) will no longer fail with \"coordsHistory must be at least 2 sets of coords\" when specifying `{ multiple: true }`. Fixes [#3738](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3738).\n*   Cypress now checks visibility correctly when an element has CSS \"position: sticky\". Fixes [#14938](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14938).\n*   After selecting a project in global mode and clicking the back button, Cypress will no longer crash. Fixes [#15089](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/15089).\n*   Errors `Refused to apply style` are gone from the console in `open-ct` during Component Testing. Addressed in [#15661](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/15661).\n*   Some memory leaks were fixed in `@cypress/vue`. Addressed in [#15275](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/15275).\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   The types for `set-cookie` allow `string[]`, so the header's type has been changed to reflect this. Addresses [#15419](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/15419).\n*   The type definition for [`cy.writeFile()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/writefile) now allows 4 arguments. Addresses [#15353](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/15353).\n*   [`.then()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/then) will show the correct type when raw HTMLElements are provided.

Fixes [#15453](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/15453).\n*   A regression in [6.7.0](#6-7-0) has been fixed so that the `projectId` will be written correctly to the `cypress.json` file on initial creation without an extra config object. Fixes [#15497](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/15497).\n\n## 6.7.0[​](#6-7-0 \"Direct link to 6.7.0\")\n\n_Released 3/15/2021_\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   The `experimentalRunEvents` configuration flag has been removed. You can now listen to `before:run`, `after:run`, `before:spec` and `after:spec` events in the plugins file without needing the [experimentalRunEvents](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/experiments) configuration option. See the [`before:run`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/plugins/before-run-api), [`after:run`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/plugins/after-run-api), [`before:spec`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/plugins/before-spec-api) and [`after:spec`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/plugins/after-spec-api) docs for more information. Addressed in [#15276](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/15276).\n*   When canceling a run from the Dashboard, previously only parallelized runs would cancel correctly. Now all recorded runs will respect cancelation and exit early. Addresses [#1691](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1691).\n*   [Test configuration](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/writing-and-organizing-tests#Test-Configuration) is now captured and sent when recording to the Dashboard. Addresses [#15487](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/15487).\n*   Cypress now sends test details to the Dashboard at the beginning of a recorded run, so historical test code and other data can be provided to the Dashboard upfront. Addressed in [#14925](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14925).\n*   The full stack trace from errors thrown in the preprocessor are now displayed. Addressed in [#15198](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/15198).\n*   Configuration values which are changed at runtime prior to tests running are now properly shown as resolved from the spec code within the Module API to indicate where the change originated from. Addresses [#15486](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/15486).\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   FFmpeg will no longer error (\"width not divisible by 2\") during video recording in Chromium-family browsers, including Chrome, Electron, and Edge. Fixes [#3491](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3491) and [#15300](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/15300).\n*   [cy.wait()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/wait) no longer falsely returns a timeout when the user aborts an XHR. Fixes [#9549](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9549).\n*   [.clear()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/clear) and [`.type('{selectall}{del}')`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/type) now behave the same when they're used against elements that contain text inputs. Fixes [#8447](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8447).\n*   When using `experimentalStudio`, [Cypress Studio](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/cypress-studio) now records typing by using the value of the input rather than the keys that were pressed. Studio also no longer records pressing special keys (such as arrows or ctrl) except for Enter. Fixes [#15023](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/15023).\n*   Empty jQuery objects are now properly shown in error messages in the Command Log. Fixes [#14279](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14279).\n*   Length assertions on DOM elements now properly show the user-defined assertion message if specified. Fixes [#14484](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14484).\n*   Cypress no longer scrolls on `mouse down` event, fixes [#8279](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8279).\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   We updated the UI when connecting a project to the Dashboard.

Addresses [#14749](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14749).\n\n**Deprecations:**\n\n*   The `delayMs` option for [cy.intercept()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/intercept) has been renamed to `delay`. `delayMs` will still work, but it is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Addresses [#14822](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14822).\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Fixed an issue causing a webpack compilation error when a `browserslist` is present in project root. Addresses [#8864](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8864).\n*   Fixed an issue with [cy.intercept()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/intercept) where aliases set via `req.alias` containing a period character would not work as expected. Addresses [#14444](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14444).\n*   Fixed an issue where delays set using [cy.intercept()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/intercept) would not work as expected. Addresses [#14446](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14446) and [#14511](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14511).\n*   Reverted a change to how the Chrome DevTools Protocol is established. Instead of using stdio and then falling back to TCP, Cypress now only uses TCP to try to connect to Chrome DevTools Protocol. Addresses [#14819](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14819).\n*   We now better handle spec paths containing special characters so they properly show in the code frame and work when interacting via your IDE. Addresses [#14659](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14659).\n*   We addressed several issues with the experimental [Cypress Studio](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/cypress-studio).

Addressed in [#14715](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14715).\n\n## 6.3.0[​](#6-3-0 \"Direct link to 6.3.0\")\n\n_Released 1/19/2021_\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   [**Cypress Studio**](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/cypress-studio) provides a visual way to generate tests within the Test Runner, by _recording interactions_ against the application under test. Cypress Studio is an experimental feature that can be enabled by adding the [experimentalStudio](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/experiments) attribute to your configuration, `cypress.json` by default. Address [#73](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/73).\n*   **You can now test file downloads in Cypress** without the download prompt displaying. Any files downloaded while testing file downloads will be stored in the [downloadsFolder](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration#Downloads) which is set to `cypress/downloads` by default. The `downloadsFolder` will be deleted before each run unless [trashAssetsBeforeRuns](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration#Downloads) is set to `false`. Addresses [#949](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/949).\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   When an uncaught exception is thrown outside a suite with an `.only`, the error will now correctly display in the Command Log.

Fixes [#9209](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9209).\n*   Having `waitForAnimations` set to `false` no longer affects whether Cypress fires actions on inner elements. Fixes [#14370](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14370).\n*   We fixed a regression in [5.0.0](#5-0-0) that would cause string `CYPRESS_` prefixed env variables containing commas to be parsed as multiple values. Fixes [#8818](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8818).\n*   We fixed a regression in [4.9.0](#4-9-0) where asserting `have.value` on an undefined subject would throw an error. Fixes [#14359](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14359).\n*   We updated the CDP connection to attempt to use the stdio transport first with Chrome 72 and above, before falling back to using TCP. This should remediate issues causing sporadic \"Cypress failed to make a connection to the Chrome DevTools Protocol after retrying\" errors. Fixes [#6540](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6540), [#7450](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7450), [#8674](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8674), and [#8986](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8986).\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   We removed several Chrome flags that are no longer supported.

Fixes [#9040](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9040).\n*   `multipart/form-data` is no longer wrongly encoded when using [cy.intercept()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/intercept). This should prevent `Unexpected end of multipart data` errors on the back end service where the request was pointing to. Fixes [#9359](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9359).\n*   [cy.contains()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/contains) no longer throws an error when a single quote is used inside its argument when RegExp. Fixes [#8626](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8626).\n*   Passing `capture: 'runner'` to a [cy.screenshot()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/screenshot) command inside [.within()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/within) now screenshots the entire Test Runner as expected. Fixes [#14253](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14253).\n*   [Cypress.dom.isJquery()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/cypress-api/dom#Is-jQuery) now always returns a boolean instead of `undefined` sometimes. Fixes [#14278](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14278).\n*   `calledOnceWith` and `calledOnceWithExactly` sinon matchers no longer throw an error when used within Cypress. Fixes [#9644](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9644).\n*   We now pass `--disable-backgrounding-occluded-windows` as a default flag to Chrome to prevent backgrounding rendering when the Cypress window is occluded. Fixes [#9604](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9604).\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   After login, if a name is undefined on your profile, the Test Runner will show the profile's email and link to instructions to update the name. Addresses [#14288](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14288).\n\n**Dependency Updates:**\n\n*   Upgraded `devtools-protocol` from `0.0.734984` to `0.0.839267`. Addressed in [#14353](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14353).\n*   Upgraded `electron` from `11.0.3` to `11.1.1`. Addressed in [#14352](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14352).\n\n## 6.2.0[​](#6-2-0 \"Direct link to 6.2.0\")\n\n_Released 12/21/2020_\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   You can now listen to `before:run`, `after:run`, `before:spec` and `after:spec` events in the plugins file when setting the [experimentalRunEvents](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/experiments) configuration option to `true`. See the [`before:run`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/plugins/before-run-api), [`after:run`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/plugins/after-run-api), [`before:spec`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/plugins/before-spec-api) and [`after:spec`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/plugins/after-spec-api) docs for more information.

When set to `true`, Cypress will match the supplied `url` against incoming `path`s. Addressed in [#14241](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14241).\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Passing a URL as a string or RegExp to [cy.intercept()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/intercept) will automatically set `matchUrlAgainstPath` to `true`. This means that the supplied string or RegExp will be matched against the **path** if matching against the **URL** fails. Fixes [#9379](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9379) and [#14256](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14256).\n*   Getting an alias of [cy.intercept()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/intercept) using [cy.get()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/get) will no longer always yield `null`. Fixes [#9306](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9306).\n*   [cy.intercept()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/intercept) will now automatically responds to CORS preflight requests (HTTP `OPTIONS` requests) that match defined routes. Fixes [#9599](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9599).\n*   Response errors from `forceNetworkError` can now be awaited using [cy.intercept()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/intercept) and [cy.wait()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/wait). Fixes [#9062](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9062).\n*   Using [cy.log()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/log) inside [.then()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/then) no longer breaks the subject value in the command chain. Fixes [#8084](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8084).\n*   Using [Cypress.Commands.overwrite](https://docs.cypress.io/api/cypress-api/custom-commands#Overwrite-Existing-Commands) to overwrite [.then()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/then) now preserves the proper `this` context and sets aliases correctly. Fixes [#5101](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5101).\n*   Using [Cypress.Commands.overwrite](https://docs.cypress.io/api/cypress-api/custom-commands#Overwrite-Existing-Commands) to overwrite `cy.route()` or [cy.intercept()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/intercept) and wait on its alias now properly works. Fixes [#3890](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3890) and [#9580](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9580).\n*   Cypress no longer fails to find specs if you set the fixtures folder to be the same as the integration folder. Fixes [#14226](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14226).\n*   Cypress no longer fails to show error code frames if the spec filename has a space in it, fixes [#7553](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7553).\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   `scrollBehavior` is now an allowed type when passed as test configuration.

Fixes [#9303](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9303).\n*   Lower-cased HTTP methods can now be used with [cy.intercept()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/intercept). Fixes [#9313](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9313).\n\n## 6.0.0[​](#6-0-0 \"Direct link to 6.0.0\")\n\n_Released 11/23/2020_\n\n**Summary:**\n\nCypress now offers full network stubbing support with the introduction of the [cy.intercept()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/intercept) command (previously `cy.route2()`). With [cy.intercept()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/intercept) your tests can intercept, modify and wait on any type of HTTP request originating from your app. See our guide on [Migrating `cy.route()` to `cy.intercept()`](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/migration-guide#Migrating-cyroute-to-cyintercept).\n\n**Breaking Changes:**\n\nPlease read our [Migration Guide](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/migration-guide) which explains the changes in more detail and how to change your code to migrate to Cypress 6.0.\\*\\*\n\n*   Cypress now always throws an error when asserting on an element that doesn't exist in the DOM (unless you're asserting that the element should `not.exist`). Assertions such as `not.visible`, `not.contains`, `not.have.class`, etc will now fail when used on non-existent DOM elements. Addresses [#205](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/205).\n*   DOM elements where the CSS style (or ancestors) are `opacity: 0` are no longer considered visible. However these are still considered [actionable](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/interacting-with-elements) and [any action commands](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/interacting-with-elements#Actionability) used to interact with the element will perform the action. This matches browser's implementation on how they regard elements with `opacity: 0`. Addresses [#4474](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4474).\n*   The type yielded by [cy.wait(alias)](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/wait) has changed in order to support use of [cy.intercept()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/intercept). Addressed in [#9266](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9266).\n*   The `experimentalNetworkStubbing` option has been removed and made the default behavior. You can safely removed this configuration option. Addressed in [#9185](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9185).\n*   When using [.type()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/type) and [.click()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/click) on elements inside a `contenteditable` element, the events are now properly triggered on the inside elements. This may cause unintended consequences if you were relying on the previous behavior. Addressed in [#9066](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9066).\n*   We removed several deprecation errors around APIs that were removed in versions of Cypress prior to 4.0.0. This will not cause any changes for anyone upgrading from a 4.0+ version of Cypress. For a full list of all APIs affected see [#8946](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8946).\n*   We updated our HTTP status codes and reason phrases to match Node.js `http.STATUS_CODES`. If you have code that relies on a reason phrase, then this could affect you. Addressed in [#8969](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8969).\n*   JSON request and response bodies captured by [cy.intercept()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/intercept) are now automatically parsed, removing the need to manually do `JSON.parse`. Addressed in [#9280](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9280).\n\n**Deprecations:**\n\nDeprecations still work as before but will be removed from Cypress in a future release. We encourage you to update your code now to remove uses of deprecations.\n\n*   `cy.server()` and `cy.route()` have been deprecated. In a future release, support for `cy.server()` and `cy.route()` will be removed. We encourage you to use [cy.intercept()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/intercept) instead. See our guide on [Migrating `cy.route()` to `cy.intercept()`](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/migration-guide#Migrating-cyroute-to-cyintercept). Addressed in [#9185](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/9185).\n*   `experimentalFetchPolyfill` has been deprecated. We encourage you to use [cy.intercept()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/intercept) to intercept requests using the Fetch API instead.\n*   `cy.route2()` was renamed to [cy.intercept()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/intercept). We encourage you to update usages of `cy.route2()` to use [cy.intercept()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/intercept). Addressed in [#9182](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9182).\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   The new [cy.intercept()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/intercept) command can be used to manage the behavior of HTTP requests at the network layer. Addressed in [#9182](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9182).\n*   We now pass `—disable-dev-shm-usage` to the Chrome browser flags by default. This will write shared memory files into `/tmp` instead of `/dev/shm`. If you're passing this flag in your `plugins` file, you can now remove this code. Addresses [#5336](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/5336).\n*   A warning is now displayed when passing invalid configuration keys through the CLI. Addresses [#428](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/428).\n*   The `cypress version` command now also displays the current Electron and bundled Node versions. Addresses [#9180](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9180).\n*   The `cypress version` command now accepts a `--component` flag that allows you to print the version of specific components of Cypress. ie Electron, Node, etc. Addresses [#9214](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9214).\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   We fixed a regression introduced in [3.5.0](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/changelog#3-5-0) that would cause [.type()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/type) to not type the entire string when focus was called away from the target element. Fixes [#9254](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9254).\n*   [.type()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/type) and [.click()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/click) now properly work on elements inside a `contenteditable` element. Fixes [#2717](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2717) and [#7721](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7721).\n*   We fixed a regression introduced in [5.6.0](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/changelog#5-6-0) that would cause the Test Runner to crashes and display a white page when switching tabs while tests are running. Fixes [#9151](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9151).\n*   Fixed an issue where `Content-Length` for `cy.route2` request bodies could be incorrectly recalculated. Fixes [#9166](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9166).\n\n**Documentation Changes:**\n\n*   Our [Migration Guide](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/migration-guide) has a new section for 6.0 migration.\n*   Many of our docs examples have been updated to use [cy.intercept()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/intercept) in place of `cy.route()` including our [Network Requests](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/network-requests) doc.\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   Added the type of `redirects` and changed `redirectedToUrl` optional for Response types. Addresses [#9275](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9275).\n\n**Dependency Updates**\n\n*   Upgraded Chrome browser version used during `cypress run` and when selecting Electron browser in `cypress open` from `85` to `87`. Addressed in [#9222](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/9222).\n*   Upgraded bundled Node.js version from `12.16.3` to `12.18.3`. Addressed in [#9222](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/9222).\n*   Upgraded `electron` from `10.1.5` to `11.0.2`. Addressed in [#9222](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/9222).\n\n## 5.6.0[​](#5-6-0 \"Direct link to 5.6.0\")\n\n_Released 11/09/2020_\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   You can now dynamically add aliases for requests intercepted via `cy.route2()`.

Similar to how Cypress will retry assertions when they fail, test retries will allow you to automatically retry a failed test prior to marking it as failed. Read our new guide on [Test Retries](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/test-retries) for more details.\n\n**Breaking Changes:**\n\nPlease read our [Migration Guide](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/migration-guide) which explains the changes in more detail and how to change your code to migrate to Cypress 5.0.\\*\\*\n\n*   The [`cypress-plugin-retries`](https://github.com/Bkucera/cypress-plugin-retries) plugin has been deprecated in favor of [test retries](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/test-retries) built into Cypress. Addresses [#1313](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1313).\n*   The [Cypress.Cookies.defaults()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/cypress-api/cookies) `whitelist` option has been renamed to `preserve` to more closely reflect its behavior. Addressed in [#7782](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7782).\n*   The `blacklistHosts` configuration has been renamed to [blockHosts](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration#Notes) to more closely reflect its behavior. Addressed in [#7622](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7622).\n*   The `cy.server()` `whitelist` option has been renamed to `ignore` to more closely reflect its behavior. Addresses [#6642](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6642).\n*   `libgbm-dev` is now a requirement to run Cypress on Linux. Addressed in [#7791](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/7791).\n*   Values yielded by [cy.setCookie()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/setcookie), [cy.getCookie()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/getcookie), and [cy.getCookies()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/getcookies) will now contain the `sameSite` property if specified. Addresses [#6892](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6892).\n*   The `experimentalGetCookiesSameSite` configuration flag has been removed, since this behavior is now the default. Addresses [#6892](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6892).\n*   The return type of the [Cypress.Blob](https://docs.cypress.io/api/utilities/blob) methods `arrayBufferToBlob`, `base64StringToBlob`, `binaryStringToBlob`, and `dataURLToBlob` have changed from `Promise<Blob>` to `Blob`. Addresses [#6001](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6001).\n*   Cypress no longer supports file paths with a question mark `?` or exclamation mark `!` in them. We now use the [webpack preprocessor](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/tree/master/npm/webpack-preprocessor) by default and it does not support files with question marks or exclamation marks. Addressed in [#7982](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/7982).\n*   For TypeScript compilation of spec, support, and plugins files, the `esModuleInterop` option is no longer coerced to `true`. If you need to utilize `esModuleInterop`, set it in your `tsconfig.json`. Addresses [#7575](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7575).\n*   Cypress now requires TypeScript 3.4+. Addressed in [#7856](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7856).\n*   Installing Cypress on your system now requires Node.js 10+. Addresses [#6574](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6574).\n*   In spec files, the values for the globals `__dirname` and `__filename` no longer include leading slashes. Addressed in [#7982](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/7982).\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   There's a new `retries` configuration option to configure the number of times to retry a failing test. Addresses [#1313](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1313).\n*   [.click()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/click), [.dblclick()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/dblclick), and [.rightclick()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/rightclick) now accept options `altKey`, `ctrlKey`, `metaKey`, and `shiftKey` to hold down key combinations while clicking. Addresses [#486](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/486).\n*   You can now chain `.snapshot()` off of `cy.stub()` and `cy.spy()` to disabled snapshots during those commands. For example: `cy.stub().snapshot(false)`. Addresses [#3849](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3849).\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   The error `Cannot set property 'err' of undefined` will no longer incorrectly throw when rerunning tests in the Test Runner.

Fixes [#7986](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7986).\n*   Cypress [environment variables](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/environment-variables) that accept arrays as their value will now properly evaluate as arrays. Fixes [#6810](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6810).\n*   Elements having `display: inline` will no longer be considered hidden if it has child elements within it that are visible. Fixes [#6183](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6183).\n*   When [experimentalShadowDomSupport](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/experiments) is enabled, [.parent()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/parent) and [.parentsUntil()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/parentsuntil) commands now work correctly in shadow dom as well as passing a selector to [.parents()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/parents) when the subject is in the shadow dom. Fixed in [#8202](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/8202).\n*   Screenshots will now be correctly taken when a test fails in an `afterEach` or `beforeEach` hook after the hook has already passed. Fixes [#3744](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3744).\n*   Cypress will no longer report screenshots overwritten in a `cy.screenshot()` [onAfterScreenshot](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/screenshot#Get-screenshot-info-from-the-onAfterScreenshot-callback) option as a unique screenshot. Fixes [#8079](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8079).\n*   Taking screenshots will no longer fail when the screenshot names are too long for the filesystem to accept. Fixes [#2403](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2403).\n*   The \"last used browser\" will now be correctly remembered during `cypress open` if a non-default-channel browser was selected. Fixes [#8281](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/8281).\n*   For TypeScript projects, `tsconfig.json` will now be loaded and used to configure TypeScript compilation of spec and support files. Fixes [#7006](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7006) and [#7503](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7503).\n*   `reporterStats` now correctly show the number of passed and failed tests when a test passes but the `afterEach` fails. Fixes [#7730](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7730).\n*   The Developer Tools menu will now always display in Electron when switching focus from Specs to the Test Runner. Fixes [#3559](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/3559).\n\n**Documentation Changes:**\n\n*   We have a new guide on [Test Retries](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/test-retries).\n*   Our [Migration Guide](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/migration-guide) has a new section for 5.0 migration.\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   Cypress now uses the [webpack preprocessor](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/tree/master/npm/webpack-preprocessor) by default to preprocess spec files.\n*   The **Runs** tab within the Test Runner has a new improved design when the project has not been set up or login is required.

Addresses [#2029](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2029) and [#3576](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3576).\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   We fixed a regression in [4.6.0](#4-6-0) where the address bar of the application under test would disappear when scrolling commands ran and the application under test would visually shift after taking screenshots. Fixes [#7443](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7443) and [#7466](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7466).\n*   We fixed a regression in [4.6.0](#4-6-0) where test runs could hang when loading spec files with source maps. Fixes [#7464](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7464).\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   We now display a more descriptive error message when the plugins file does not export a function. Addresses [#6611](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/6611).\n\n## 4.6.0[​](#4-6-0 \"Direct link to 4.6.0\")\n\n_Released 5/20/2020_\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   [Errors](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/debugging#Errors) in the Test Runner now display a code frame to preview where the failure occurred with the relevant file, line number, and column number highlighted. Clicking on the file link will open the file in your [preferred file opener](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/tooling/IDE-integration#File-Opener-Preference) and highlight the line and column in editors that support it. Addresses [#3762](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3762).\n*   Cypress now utilizes [source maps](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/debugging#Source-maps) to enhance the error experience. Stack traces are translated so that your source files are shown instead of the generated file that is loaded by the browser. Cypress will include an inline source map in your spec file. If you [modify the preprocessor](https://docs.cypress.io/api/plugins/preprocessors-api), ensure that inline source maps are enabled to get the same experience. Users of `@cypress/webpack-preprocessor` should upgrade to v5.4.1 or later of the package which will correctly inline source maps.

Addresses [#7314](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7314).\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Default [TypeScript](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/tooling/typescript-support) options are now set to `module: commonJS` which Node.js and the browser expect. This fixes a situation where setting a different module in a `tsconfig.json` would cause errors to throw if you had `export`, `import` or `async` keywords in your code. Fixes [#7005](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7005), [#7011](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7011), [#7043](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7043), and [#7151](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7151).\n*   When [experimentalSourceRewriting](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/experiments) is enabled, setting `location` or `location.href` to a relative href, or using `location.replace` or `location.assign` with a relative href will no longer navigate the AUT to the wrong URL.

Fixes [#4776](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4776).\n*   Fixed a bug when dismissing pinned snapshots that would cause the page to be wiped with nothing rendered. Fixes [#4864](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4864).\n*   We upgraded the `mocha-teamcity-reporter` dependency so that it no longer errors in certain situations when trying to access duration on tests. Fixes [#4654](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4654).\n*   We upgraded the `lodash` dependency to fix a security vulnerability warning. Fixes [#4699](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4699), [#4730](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4730), [#4743](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4743).\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   We now ensure we are shipping with production versions of dependencies such as `react`, `mobx`, etc. This should help to prevent conflicts with Developer Tools extensions and increase performance by reducing memory, heap allocation, and overall JS bundle size. Addresses [#4844](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4844).\n*   Video recordings now wait after all tests finish to ensure that the video captures the final rendered frames of the browser. This prevents the last few paints from being cut off. Fixes [#2370](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2370).\n*   Cypress now looks for any npm proxy configuration values as a fallback when no other system proxy configuration is found. This brings this feature into parity with how npm reads off proxy configuration values during an `npm install`. Addresses [#4719](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4719).\n*   We updated the messaging when there is a failure downloading Cypress to recommend checking your proxy settings. Addresses [#1662](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1662).\n*   A warning message now displays if you attempt to run the Cypress binary directly instead of going through the cypress `npm` package. Addresses [#1573](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1573).\n*   There are newly added examples in the TypeScript definitions for [custom commands](https://docs.cypress.io/api/cypress-api/custom-commands), [cy.location()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/location) and [.should()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/should). Addresses [#3684](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3684) and [#4715](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4715).\n*   The types for the [`cy.contains(content, options)`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/contains) syntax have been added. Addresses [#4727](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4727).\n*   Types for `cy.once()` have been added. Addressed in [#4788](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/4788).\n*   There is now a `{ parseSpecialCharSequences: false }` option to [cy.type()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/type) that disables parsing the special character sequences found between the `{}` characters. This will now type what you've provided literally without any special parsing. Fixes [#4287](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4287).\n*   You can now zoom in the main Test Runner window and also the Electron browser. Corresponding keyboard shortcuts for Zoom in, Zoom out and Actual Size are also available. Addresses [#1231](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1231).\n*   When viewing the Test Runner's main window at its smallest size, the header text no longer incorrectly wraps. Addresses [#86](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/86).\n*   We're continuing to make process in converting our codebase from CoffeeScript to JavaScript. Addresses [#2690](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2690) in [#4781](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/4781) and [#4817](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/4817).\n*   We increased the cypress binary verification phase from 10 seconds to 30 seconds to accommodate underpowered or overwhelmed machines typically found in CI environments. Addresses [#4624](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4624).\n\n**Documentation Changes:**\n\n*   We have new instructions on how to set up [GitHub Integration](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/cloud/integrations/source-control/github) with the Cypress Dashboard.\n*   Updated instructions for adding types for custom commands in the [TypeScript Support](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/tooling/typescript-support#Types-for-Custom-Commands) doc. Addressed in [#1901](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-documentation/pull/1901)\n*   Added a section about video encoding and how to speed up the encoding time to [Screenshots and Videos](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/screenshots-and-videos#Video-encoding) doc. Addressed in [#1880](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-documentation/pull/1880)\n\n**Dependency Updates**\n\n*   Upgraded `@ffmpeg-installer/ffmpeg` from `1.0.17` to `1.0.19`.

Addressed in [#4797](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/4797).\n*   We also updated and removed some dependencies used for development.\n\n## 3.4.0[​](#3-4-0 \"Direct link to 3.4.0\")\n\n_Released 7/9/2019_\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   Users can now log in to the Test Runner through the browser installed on their system. This also allows for login via GitHub with U2F keys. Addresses [#3583](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3583), [#4337](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4337), and [#1162](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1162).\n*   Google or SSO (if configured) login is now supported in the Test Runner. Addresses [#3519](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3519).\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Cypress now properly supports partial matching of string values for assertions `contain.text`, `contain.html`, and `contain.value`. Fixes [#1969](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1969).\n*   A form is now properly submitted when using `.type('{enter}')` on a form containing no buttons and only one input that allows implicit submission. Fixes [#4495](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4495).\n*   Extra whitespace and quotations are now stripped from the `CYPRESS_INSTALL_BINARY` environment variable to help prevent some unexpected results when set in Windows. Fixes [#4506](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4506).\n*   Electron rendering warnings are no longer printed to console output. Fixes [#4288](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4288).\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   We now expose a downloadable binary for each commit made into the [develop branch](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/commits/develop) of the [cypress](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress) repository so that pre-released versions can be installed. See [this commit](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/commit/52ca8ed8399c5ef467efbee7a2d00fe0863e7f36#commitcomment-34237047) for an example. Addresses [#4525](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4525).\n*   There are now a series of checks that are run during download of Cypress to verify that the zip file downloaded is the correct file. Addresses [#812](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/812) and [#3515](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3515).\n*   A warning now displays for Windows' users who have Group Policy settings that may interfere with usage of Cypress. Addresses [#4391](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4391).\n*   There's a new warning when mouse interactions fail displaying that it failed due to the element having CSS `pointer-events: none`. Addresses [#3164](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3164).\n*   If a URL is passed to `cy.route()` containing percent-encoded characters, we now display a warning explaining that `cy.route()` expects a decoded URL. Addresses [#2372](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2372).\n*   Environment variables for Semaphore 2.0 are now captured when recording tests to the Dashboard. Fixes [#4671](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4671).\n*   We now capture environment variables set from Concourse CI when recording tests to the Dashboard. Fixes [#4376](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4376).\n*   We replaced capturing environment variables from SnapCI (which is no longer available) to instead capture ones set from GoCD when recording tests to the Dashboard. Fixes [#2680](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2680).\n*   The [JSON schema file](https://on.cypress.io/cypress.schema.json) used for [intelligent code completion](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/tooling/IDE-integration#Intelligent-Code-Completion) for the Cypress configuration file has been updated to match our documentation.\n\n**Documentation Changes:**\n\n*   New error message added about policy settings to our [Error Messages](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/error-messages) doc. Addressed in [#1567](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-documentation/pull/1754).\n*   [Real World](https://docs.cypress.io/examples/applications#Realworld) example tests were added to Example Applications doc.

Addressed in [#4620](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/4620).\n*   Upgraded `request-progress` from `0.4.0` to `3.0.0`. Addressed in [#4584](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/4584).\n*   We also updated and removed some dependencies used for development.\n\n## 3.3.2[​](#3-3-2 \"Direct link to 3.3.2\")\n\n_Released 6/27/2019_\n\n**Performance Improvements:**\n\n*   We fixed a regression introduced in [3.3.0](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/changelog#3-3-0) that was causing the Test Runner to do extremely unnecessary re-renders of the Command Log on any command change - leading to exponential performance degradation on any run. This was the root cause behind many users experiencing a reduction in performance when upgrading to `3.3.0` or above. Fixes [#4411](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4411) and [#4313](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4313).\n*   We reduced memory consumption and improved the performance of running tests anytime you're inside of `cypress open`. Fixes [#2366](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2366).\n*   We no longer delay proxied responses with no body with status codes 1xx, 204, 304. This fixes a regression introduced in [3.2.0](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/changelog#3-2-0) where responses with these status codes were delayed when using a proxy. Fixes [#4298](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4298).\n*   Snapshots were previously being mistakenly stored then instantly deleted when `numTestsKeptInMemory` was set to 0. We now no longer record the snapshots at all when `numTestsKeptInMemory` is set to 0. This should slightly improve the performance of running tests with this setting. Fixes [#4104](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4104) and [#4164](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4164).\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Cypress no longer watches files when run using `cypress run`. This will fix some runs that were crashing with an `ENOSPC` error. Fixes [#4283](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4283).\n*   Cypress now correctly handles `blur` and `focus` events in situations where the browser has lost focus. Fixes [#4039](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4039), [#1176](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1176), and [#1486](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1486).\n*   If the DOM element provided to [.type()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/type) is already in focus, Cypress no longer attempts to click on the DOM element. This allows you to call `.focus()` on elements that are focusable, but not necessarily clickable and type into them using `.type()`. Fixes [#3001](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3001) and [#4420](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4420).\n*   Some elements inside of a parent with CSS `overflow: hidden` that flow outside of its parent are now properly considered hidden. [#4161](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4161)\n*   Elements that are inside a parent with CSS `position: absolute` which is itself inside of a parent element with `overflow: hidden` are now properly considered visible. Fixes [#4395](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4395) and [#755](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/755).\n*   `<option>` and `<optgroup>` elements are now properly considered visible if it is contained within a visible `<select>`. Fixes [#4473](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4473).\n*   `<body>` and `<html>` elements are now properly always considered visible. Fixes [#4475](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4475).\n*   `<td>` and `<tr>` elements with CSS `visibility: collapse` are now properly considered hidden. Fixes [#4476](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4476).\n*   We now correctly handle form submission when using `.type('{enter}')` on a form containing a button of type `reset`. Fixes [#3909](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3909).\n*   If a site's `content-type` is `null`, `undefined` or cannot be determined during [`cy.visit()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/visit), we now look at the content of the site and evaluate whether it looks like HTML. If it does look like HTML we no longer error and continue as if it the site's `content-type` is `text/html`. [#1727](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1727) [#773](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/773) [#3101](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3101).\n*   Previously Cypress would send the `auth` header to any URLs that match the CORS origin of the original `auth` header. We now correctly only send the `auth` headers when there is an exact match on the [protection space](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7235#section-2.2). Fixes [#4267](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4267).\n*   Requests that go through [cy.visit()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/visit) or [cy.request()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/request) are now automatically retried on `ENOTFOUND` errors. Fixes [#4424](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4424) and [#1755](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1755).\n*   Cypress now errors when the `body` parameter passed to [cy.request()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/request) contains a circular reference. Fixed in [#4407](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/4407).\n*   We fixed an issue where the `ignoreTestFiles` configuration was being filtered out when passed via a command line flag, so in effect being ignored. Fixes [#1696](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1696).\n*   Setting `NO_PROXY` is now respected for HTTPS urls, as it should be. Fixes [#4303](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4303).\n*   When running tests with non-string test titles, the screenshots now automatically stringify the test titles instead of throwing an error. Fixes [#4310](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4310).\n*   Cypress no longer incorrectly errors when calling `cy.window().screenshot()`, `cy.window().scrollTo()` or `cy.window().trigger()` in an application with multiple iframes. Fixes [#4396](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4396).\n*   Fixed a regression in [3.3.0](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/changelog#3-3-0) causing some users using proxy to see the \"Browser was not launched through Cypress\" error during `cypress open`. This was caused by incorrectly routing requests for Cypress's internal server on `localhost` through the user's proxy. Fixes [#4410](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4410).\n*   We fixed situations during a test failure where the Test Runner would throw `RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded`. Fixes [#1958](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1958) and [#4346](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4346).\n*   Fixed issue where `window.performance.getEntriesByType` would return `undefined` instead of an array within application code when using [cy.clock()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/clock). Fixes [#3625](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3625).\n*   Passing an array of strings to `ignoreTestFiles` no longer causes an error to throw. Fixes [#4312](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4312).\n*   Fixed a visual bug when aliasing a non-route subject multiple times that would cause the Test Runner to show 'undefined' alias with empty counts. Fixes [#4429](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4429).\n*   Fixed regression introduced in [3.2.0](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/changelog#3-2-0) where Cypress would error because it could not find a type definition file for '../sinon'. Fixes [#4272](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4272).\n*   [cy.writeFile()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/writefile) no longer errors in TypeScript files when passing an `options` object as its third argument. Fixes [#4461](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4461).\n*   [cy.stub()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/stub) no longer errors in TypeScript files when evaluating returns. Fixes [#4302](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4302).\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   Warnings are now displayed when recording in `cypress run` to warn when a project is nearing its organization's usage limit. They also clearly explain any consequences of going over a plan's usage limit. Addresses [#4530](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4530).\n*   An warning icon with a tooltip is displayed in the Runs tab of the Test Runner when parallelization was disabled during the run due to being over the organization's usage limit. Addresses [#4489](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4489).\n*   You can now opt out of sending exceptions to `https://api.cypress.io` by setting `CYPRESS_CRASH_REPORTS=0` in your system environment variables. [#4386](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4386)\n*   We are now capturing Google Cloud build details when recording tests to the Cypress Dashboard. Addresses [#3582](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3582).\n*   The tests titles and headers in the Command Log no longer truncate with ellipsis when the text is longer than that width of the Command Log. Instead the text wraps so that all text is shown. Addresses [#3947](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3947).\n*   Special env vars are now truncated in `Cypress.env()` and the debug logs. Addresses [#4501](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4501).\n*   The `projectId` in now displayed in the configuration in the Test Runner settings like all other configuration values. Fixes [#4500](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4500).\n*   When recording to the Dashboard, unrecognized warnings coming from the API server are now displayed in stdout. Fixes [#4489](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4489).\n\n**Documentation Changes:**\n\n*   New [Code Coverage](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/tooling/code-coverage) doc.

This bug would exhibit itself when verifying and running Cypress the first time after installation. You may have seen these logs when running in CI. Fixes [#4255](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4255).\n*   Fixed a bug for users running external network proxies that prevented requests from completing. Requests should now all work correctly. Fixes [#4257](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4257).\n*   Fixed a regression in [3.3.0](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/changelog#3-3-0) causing large requests such as `multipart/form-data` uploads to hang. Fixes [#4240](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4240), [#4252](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4252), and [#4253](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4253).\n*   Fixed issue where support for `have.focus`, `not.have.focus`, `be.focused` and `not.be.focused` [assertions](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/assertions) were not working. Fixes [#4265](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4265).\n*   Names given to [`.as()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/as) now work properly when they contain a `.` character. Fixes [#3512](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3512).\n*   The proper error is now thrown when passing `{log: false}` to a Cypress command that failed. Fixes [#3847](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3847).\n*   Fixed an issue where highlighting a command's snapshot would throw an error when no application was rendered in the AUT frame. Fixes [#4177](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4177).\n*   We now properly detect the branch name when running Cypress in AppVeyor. Fixed in [#4234](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/4234).\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   Fix capitalization of `Xvfb` in error messages. Addressed in [#4262](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/4262).\n\n**Documentation Changes:**\n\n*   We have some newly translated documentation in [Chinese](http://on.cypress.io/zh-cn) and [Japanese](http://on.cypress.io/ja). If you'd like to help in translating more, please open a pull request in our [documentation repo](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-documentation).\n\n## 3.3.0[​](#3-3-0 \"Direct link to 3.3.0\")\n\n_Released 5/17/2019_\n\n**News:**\n\n*   We've [written a blog post](https://www.cypress.io/blog/2019/05/22/how-we-improved-network-speed-by-300-in-cypress-3-3-0/) about the 300% increase in proxy performance delivered in `3.3.0`.\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   Cypress now automatically reads from your system's `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, and `NO_PROXY` environment variables and proxies traffic accordingly through Cypress based on these values. This includes network traffic within your application under test, when downloading Cypress, and when accessing 'Runs' within the Test Runner. Please read our new [Proxy Configuration](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/proxy-configuration) doc to understand more about proxy configuration in Cypress.

Addresses [#477](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/477).\n*   The console log when clicking on the [cy.visit()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/visit) command now displays its resolved `options` arguments. Addresses [#3721](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3721).\n*   There's a new 'canceled' XHR status shown on the Command Log to indicate the difference between calling `xhr.abort()` and the browser canceling the request due to page navigation. Addresses [#3973](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3973).\n*   The Electron browser now runs Chrome Version 61. Addresses [#4000](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4000).\n*   Running Cypress via `cypress run` now supports scripts of `type=\"module\"`. Fixes [#3696](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3696).\n*   Exposed [Cypress.isCy()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/cypress-api/iscy) method to check if a value is a valid instance of `cy` or a `cy` chainable.

Fixes [#3717](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3717).\n*   When running Cypress with `NODE_OPTIONS` environment variables set, Cypress no longer issues an incorrect 0 exit code. [#1676](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1676)\n*   Fixed a regression introduced in [3.2.0](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/changelog#3-2-0) that caused [.its()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/its) to no longer retry when it yields `undefined`. [#3837](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3837)\n*   Fixed a regression introduced in [3.2.0](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/changelog#3-2-0) that caused [cy.fixture()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/fixture) to throw a `EISDIR` error if a directory had the same name as a file within that same directory. Fixes [#3739](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3739).\n*   `user-agent` headers sent as arguments to [cy.request()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/request) and [cy.visit()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/visit) are now properly sent. Fixes [#3873](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3873) and [#3719](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3719).\n*   When a request is proxied through Cypress and there is a network error, we no longer send an HTML response with a 500 status code. We now kill the browser-facing socket and let the network error be handled by the application under test. Fixes [#4101](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4101), [#4231](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4231), [#1036](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1036), [#4231](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4231), and [#1398](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1398).\n*   We changed Cypress's implementation to no longer rely on internal XHR events when the browser navigates.

Fixes [#3192](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3192) and [#1469](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1469).\n*   If an error occurs during `cypress verify`, we now kill the verification process after 10 seconds and print the error message. This should prevent some situations where Cypress would hang during installation or verification and never exit. Fixes [#819](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/819).\n*   Cypress automatically retries `cypress verify` and `cypress run` commands by starting its own Xvfb server on Linux if the first attempt fails due to possible `DISPLAY` misconfiguration. Addresses [#4034](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4034).\n*   Cypress now properly handles typing JavaScript object prototype methods (like `hasOwnProperty`) into [`.type()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/type). Fixes [#3423](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3423).\n*   We now set the `form` option to `true` if the `Content-Type` header equals `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` and `json` is not already set by a user. This fixes a situation where Cypress would try to parse the `body` as a string, resulting in a confusing error message. Fixes [#2923](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2923).\n*   [cy.contains()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/contains) now correctly handles comma delimited arguments passed to the selector argument. Fixes [#2407](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2407).\n*   Passing a browser path containing spaces now works properly when passed to the `--browser` argument. Fixes [#3979](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3979)\n*   Fixed display of tooltips when selecting elements from the Selector Playground so that they display at the correct coordinates when scrolling.

Fixes [#3652](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3652).\n*   Cypress now properly parses environment variables with empty values. Fixes [#3742](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3742).\n*   Assertions running outside of a test are now properly handled in Cypress instead of throwing internal errors. Fixes [#3926](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3926).\n*   [Cypress.log()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/cypress-api/cypress-log) now throws an error when not properly passed an object as its argument. Addresses [#3658](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3658).\n*   [Cypress.log()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/cypress-api/cypress-log) no longer throws when called before any other Cypress commands. Fixes [#3658](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3658).\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   We now better support capturing environment variables within Azure DevOps. Addresses [#3657](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3657).\n*   Cypress now only scans for spec changes when the watcher sees changes, rather than polling to scan. Addresses [#3069](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3069).\n*   The ability to open the context menu to see \"Inspect Element\" has been reenabled in the Electron browser. Addresses [#4002](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4002).\n*   We no longer package non-Windows FFmpeg builds with Windows builds, resulting in a 35-40% reduction in zipped size and a 36-43% reduction in unzipped size of download. Addresses [#3888](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3888).\n*   The warning messages when going over test recording limits have been updated to correctly display 'monthly tests' and 'private tests' where necessary. Addresses [#4024](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4024).\n*   When an HTTP request is received by the proxy layer, by default, we send it with a `Connection: keep-alive` header so that the connection will be reused if possible. Addresses [#3857](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3857).\n*   Improved accessibility of Test Runner for screen readers. Addresses [#3850](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3850).\n*   Cypress type definition now allow a `timeout` option in [cy.hash()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/hash).

Addresses [#2033](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2033).\n*   The Cypress Chrome extension now has a static ID of `caljajdfkjjjdehjdoimjkkakekklcck`. This allows Cypress to be added to your allowed extensions for those working under corporate policies that prohibit extensions. Addresses [#3673](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3673), [#1239](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1239) and [#2494](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2494).\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Problems logging in through GitHub in the Test Runner have been fixed. The GitHub login window no longer shows the browser support banner and the \"Authorize cypress-io\" button is no longer disabled. Fixes [#1251](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1251).\n*   Fixed an issue when testing applications using older versions of jQuery. They now no longer throw `item.first is not a function`. Fixes [#2927](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2927).\n*   Cypress now detects more instances of `browser` installations. Fixes [#3183](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3183) and [#3218](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3218).\n*   Fixed issue with loading fixture files containing more than one `.` in their filename while not specifying the file extension. We are also displaying a clearer warning when a fixture file cannot be found. Fixes [#1402](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1402).\n*   All third party `@types` have been moved from Cypress `dependencies` into `devDependencies`. This should fix situations where user's type dependencies were conflicting with Cypress's third party type definitions. Fixes [#3371](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3371) and [#1227](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1227).\n*   `Cypress.config('baseUrl')` has been updated to no longer strip singular `/` at the end of urls and instead only strip instances of multiple `/`. Fixes [#3540](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3540).\n*   The prompt to \"Restore pages?\" is no longer displayed within Chrome upon restarting a crashed Chrome window. Addresses [#2048](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2048).\n*   [cy.wrap()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/wrap) no longer throws an error when a non-jQuery wrapped DOM element is passed in as an argument. Fixes [#3549](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3549).\n*   Fixed issue where all arguments passed to `setTimeout` or `setInterval` were not properly passed on to the target function. Fixes [#3592](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3592).\n*   [.filter()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/filter) has been updated so that when called with a function, the options are now properly read. Fixes [#3315](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3315).\n*   Cypress's recognition of websites attempting framebusting has been updated to include framebusting code wrapped within `()`. [#3267](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3267)\n*   When `.its()` returns `undefined` it no longer errors. It will now follow the same logic as all other commands and only fail when directly by a [.should()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/should) command with an assertion that is not met. Fixes [#1531](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1531).\n*   When [cy.wrap()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/wrap) is followed directly by a [.should()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/should) command, `cy.wrap()` will now [retry](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/retry-ability) when its argument evaluates to `undefined` until it meets the requirements of the assertion or the `cy.wrap()` command times out. Fixes [#3241](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3241).\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   We now display a warning when passing an argument to `--spec` that is not surrounded by quotes `\"\"` recommending that the argument instead be surrounded by quotes. In some cases, not providing quotes can cause the arguments to be read in a way that is likely not its intended use. Addresses [#3318](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3318) and [#2298](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2298).\n*   The number of logs printed when installing Cypress in docker has been reduced. Partially addresses [#1243](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1243).\n*   The seeded Kitchen Sink examples have some new examples showing how to add a message to assertions, how to compare the text content of two elements, and how to make assertions about `data` attributes. The examples also have some small typo fixes. Fixes [#502](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/502). Addressed in [#3272](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/3272), [#3287](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/3287), and [#3700](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/3700).\n*   We now only mount internal servers on `loopback`. Addresses [#3712](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3712).\n*   The instructions in Cypress's update window now include `yarn` update instructions alongside `npm`. Addresses [#2871](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2871).\n*   The spec file's font weight has been increased within the Test Runner for better readability. Addressed in [#3065](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3065).\n*   We improved the error message displayed when a record key is unrecognized during `cypress run`. Addresses [#1449](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1449).\n*   We improved the typings when using `Cypress.on` to listen for `window.alert` events to allow for `Sinon.stub`. Fixes [#3451](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3451).\n*   Fixed typo in typing for [.trigger](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/trigger) options. Addressed in [#3588](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/3588).\n\n**Documentation Changes:**\n\n*   New [Retryability](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/retry-ability) doc [#1278](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-documentation/issues/1278)\n*   Updated `--browser` and `browser` args to accept `path` [#1419](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-documentation/issues/1419)\n*   Document how to accept or reject project transfers [#1474](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-documentation/issues/1474)\n*   Updated [docs](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/launching-browsers) on explain how to run Chrome and Chromium browsers [#1339](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-documentation/issues/1339)\n*   Added `{home}` and `{end}` character sequences to [`cy.type()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/type) doc.

Fixes [#1311](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1311).\n*   Fixed regression introduced in `3.1.4` that caused an `InvalidStateError` when visiting a page with an XHR request with a `responseType` other than `text` or `''`. Fixes [#3008](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3008).\n*   Fixed several issues in Chrome\\* versions >= 72 in the Cypress proxy that caused using `cy.visit()` with `localhost` to fail, or using `localhost` inside of the `baseUrl` configuration option. Fixes [#1872](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1872) and [#3252](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3252) and [#1777](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1777).\n*   Fixed another issue in Chrome\\* versions >= 72 where a scrollable command log would cause the entire application to be scrollable. Fixes [#3253](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3253).\n*   Fixed not correctly passing the `timeout` option for [cy.request()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/request). This should fix some instances where large `timeout` values would cause `ESOCKETTIMEDOUT` errors. Fixes [#2669](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2669).\n*   Fixed issue where Cypress would inject a script tag before the `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration when the document only contained the doctype declaration. Fixes [#2617](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2617).\n*   The error message when visiting a site with an invalid content-type now prints the correct content-type of the response Cypress received from the web server. Fixes [#3101](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3101).\n*   Fixed issue where an internal `layout.html` file would inadvertently get loaded instead of the spec file. Fixes [#2891](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2891).\n*   Fixed issue where the Chromium browser was not detected in Linux due to Cypress not distinguishing between Chrome and Chromium browsers with the same version. Fixes [#1400](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1400).\n*   Fixed issue of Cypress being unable to play videos with `autoplay`. We now pass the `--no-user-gesture-required` command line switch to Chrome. Fixes [#2376](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2376).\n*   We now pass the Chromium command line switches `--use-fake-ui-for-media-stream` and `--use-fake-device-for-media-stream` to Chrome by default in order to better support testing webcam functionality. Fixes [#2704](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2704).\n*   Updated filenames allowed for screenshots to allow more characters that are valid.

Fixes [#2589](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2589).\n*   Using [.clear()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/clear) on inputs of type 'date' is now working. Fixes [#2738](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2738)\n*   Fixed issue where `event` was undefined when using an `onload` event handler. Fixed [#2859](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2859)\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   Improved errors shown when opening a project in the Desktop Application. The design is more readable and the error's stack trace is now expandable. Addresses [#2955](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2955).\n*   Improved experience of search in Desktop Application when there are no results. Addresses [#3146](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3146).\n*   Updated tooltip content so that it no longer flows outside of the tooltip in the Test Runner when displaying longer routes. Fixes [#2980](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2980).\n*   Added word labels beside icons in Desktop Application for 'Support' and 'Docs' links. Addresses [#3091](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3091).\n*   Updated the CLI to no longer silence important stdout from `cypress version`, `cypress cache list` etc commands. Addresses [#2705](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2705).\n*   Fixed incorrect type definition for options usage for [.then()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/then). Addresses [#3075](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3075).\n*   Fixed incorrect JSDoc comments in type definition for [.focus()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/focus) and better formatted comments in type definitions. Addresses [#2975](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2975) and [#2954](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2954).\n*   Updated error messages to include single quotes when displaying written test code. Addresses [#2684](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2684)\n\n**Documentation Changes:**\n\n*   Added example on how to use a fake video for webcam testing to [Browser API doc](https://docs.cypress.io/api/plugins/browser-launch-api#Use-fake-video-for-webcam-testing).\n\n**Dependency Updates**\n\n*   We've begun automating our dependency update process in order to avoid accidental dependency updates. Addresses [#2990](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2990) and [#3025](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3025).\n*   Upgraded `sinon` from `3.2.0` to `3.3.0`. Addresses [#1328](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1328).\n\n## 3.1.4[​](#3-1-4 \"Direct link to 3.1.4\")\n\n_Released 12/25/2018_\n\nMerry Christmas everyone!\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Fixed a very longstanding (!) issue where [.click()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/click) would fail to click the center coordinates of elements with style `display: inline`. Cypress would instead report that the element was being covered causing the error: `cy.click() failed because this element is being covered by another element`. Fixes [#210](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/210).\n*   We now no longer abort XHR's which have their `.abort()` method called but are already complete. This fixes an edge case where complete XHR's were having their `disposer` function called in frameworks like `rxJS` which lead to Cypress accidentally re-aborting the XHR's after they were complete. Fixes [#761](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/761).\n*   Fixed issues involving XHRs displaying as 'aborted' in the Cypress Command Log when they were not actually aborted. Fixes [#1652](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1652).\n*   We no longer abort XHR request during the page's `unload` event and allow the browser to handle natively calling abort. Fixes [#2968](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2968).\n*   Fixed an issue where Cypress's `devDependencies` were being included in the Windows binary. Fixes [#2896](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2896).\n*   Fixed issue where XHR's `onreadystatechange` was not receiving the proper event arguments. Fixes [#2925](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2925).\n*   We now properly strip leading paths of files on uncaught errors from Windows OS. Fixes [#2936](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2936).\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   Removed the word 'already' from the Cypress install message in order to be less confusing. Addresses [#2754](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2754).\n*   Fixed incomplete type definitions for [cy.request](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/request). Fixes [#2305](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2305).\n\n**Dependency Updates**\n\n*   Upgraded `commit-info` from `2.0.0` to `2.1.1`. Fixes [#2848](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2848).\n*   Upgraded `lodash` from `4.17.10` to `4.17.11`. Fixes [#2929](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2929).\n\n## 3.1.3[​](#3-1-3 \"Direct link to 3.1.3\")\n\n_Released 12/03/2018_\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Fixed regression introduced in [3.1.1](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/changelog#3-1-1) with `requestAnimationFrame` that caused some animations not to run. Fixes [#2725](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2725).\n*   Fixed regression introduced in [3.1.2](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/changelog#3-1-2) that caused DOM elements passed to [cy.wrap()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/wrap) to no longer yield the proper jQuery array instance. Fixes [#2820](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2820).\n*   Fixed regression causing invocations of [`cy.clock()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/clock) to error on subsequent tests. Fixes [#2850](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2850).\n*   Fixed issue where a fix included in [3.1.2](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/changelog#3-1-2) did not pass the `windowsHide` argument to the proper options. Fixes [#2667](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2667) and [#2809](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2809).\n*   Passing [`.check({ force: true })`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/check) no longer requires the checkbox or radio to be visible. Fixes [#1376](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1376).\n\n**Misc**\n\n*   Updated types to support promises as arguments within [cy.wrap](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/wrap). Fixes [#2807](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/2807).\n*   We now expose all jQuery methods and values onto [`Cypress.$`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/utilities/$). Fixes [#2830](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2830).\n*   [cy.wait()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/wait) now accepts a separate timeout option for `requestTimeout` and `responseTimeout`. Fixes [#2446](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2446).\n\n**Documentation Changes:**\n\n*   Added `requestTimeout` and `responseTimeout` options to [cy.wait()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/wait)\n*   Added 'History' table to [cy.wait()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/wait)\n*   Added 'Alias' for assertions that are aliases of each other to [Assertions](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/assertions)\n\n**Dependency Updates**\n\n*   Upgraded nodemon from `^1.8.1` to `^1.8.7`. Fixes [#2864](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/2864).\n*   Upgraded request from `^2.27.0` and `^2.28.0` to `^4.0.0`, Fixes [#2455](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2455).\n\n## 3.1.2[​](#3-1-2 \"Direct link to 3.1.2\")\n\n_Released 11/18/2018_\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Fixed a regression caused in `3.1.1` where we attempted to set a property on an invalid cookie sent from a server. Fixes [#2724](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2724).\n*   Fixed Cypress not correctly aborting long running connections (such as server sent events) on proxied requests. Fixes [#2612](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2612).\n*   Fixed bug where tests were failing due to assertions causing Cypress to accidentally iterate through cross-origin iframes. If you were seeing \"random\" cross-origin errors, this likely fixes those issues. Fixes [#2784](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2784).\n*   Fixed incorrectly setting `charCode` and `keyCode` when using [`.type()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/type) on a few different special characters such as `{`. Fixes [#2105](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2105).\n*   Fixed another regression in `3.1.1` where passing `undefined` to a `setTimeout` caused Cypress to error. Fixes [#2719](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2719).\n*   Fixed a bug in node core where Cypress would not show up in `Windows` for users on `node >= 11`. Fixes [#2667](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2667).\n*   Fixed a bug with trashing assets in linux that caused recursive `.Trash` files to show up. We now have opted to actually `rm -rf` the files in linux because trashing is too inconsistent between linux distros. Fixes [#2742](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2742).\n\n**Misc**\n\n*   Added type definitions for `Cypress.moment()`. Fixes [#2746](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2746).\n*   We now display better error messages in the CLI when runs exceed billing limits. Fixes [#1689](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1689).\n\n**Dependency Updates**\n\n*   Removed `progress` [#2733](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2733).\n\n## 3.1.1[​](#3-1-1 \"Direct link to 3.1.1\")\n\n_Released 11/2/2018_\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   You can now pass a `flag` option to [cy.writeFile()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/writefile). The [following flags](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_file_system_flags) are available. Fixes [#1249](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1249).\n*   There is a new [CYPRESS\\_DOWNLOAD\\_MIRROR](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/advanced-installation#Mirroring) environment variable for installing Cypress at a mirror url. Fixes [#2609](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/2609).\n*   The [Module API](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/module-api) now returns the `runUrl` from `cypress.run()`. Fixes [#2596](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2596).\n*   Specs now properly display as focused when navigating through specs via the keyboard. Fixes [#2273](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/2273).\n*   Tasks registered in the plugins file with the 'task' event are merged with any tasks registered by previous calls to `on('task')`, instead of overwriting the previous tasks. Fixes [#2284](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2284).\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Fixed a bug where Cypress would error when a secure cookie flag was set and then expired from an HTTPS url without the subsequent secure flag. Due to the way Cypress was constructing the url, this would fail to actually remove the cookie. Fixes [#1264](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1264), [#1321](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1321), [#1799](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1799).\n*   We now truncate filenames for screenshots to not exceed 255 characters in length. Previously there were cases where the screenshot filename would exceed 255 characters and error. Fixes [#2403](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2403) and [#2665](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2665).\n*   Fixed issue when using [cy.writeFile()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/writefile) and passing an object to a `.json` file. The object is now correctly written to the JSON file instead of a string. Fixes [#2373](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/2373).\n*   We updated how we handle [trashAssetsBeforeRuns](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration#Screenshots) behavior. We now trash the contents of the [screenshotsFolder](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/legacy-configuration#Folders--Files) and [videosFolder](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/legacy-configuration#Folders--Files) directories instead of trashing the directories themselves. This helps maintain any file access permissions for the directories. Fixes [#1943](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1943) and [#2600](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2600).\n*   Fixed bug where mocked Dates using [cy.clock()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/clock) would not be an instance of `Date`. Fixes [#2570](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2570).\n*   Directories within specs whose names contain `.` are now correctly read as directories instead of spec files within the Test Runner. Fixes [#2423](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2423).\n*   Cypress no longer automatically takes screenshots of skipped tests. Fixes [#2368](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2368).\n*   Fixed an issue where returning/resolving `undefined` from a [cy.task()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/task) handler resulted in an incorrect runtime error. Fixes [#2553](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2553).\n*   Update [modifyObstructiveCode](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration#modifyObstructiveCode) to account for framebusting techniques that use `window.frameElement`, so that Applications using this technique will run properly in Cypress. Fixes [#2582](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2582).\n*   Fixed bug where only the first DOM element of an array of DOM elements would be blacked out after being passed as argument to `blackout` within [cy.screenshot()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/screenshot). Fixes [#2508](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2508).\n*   We fixed an issue involving timers after running [cy.screenshot()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/screenshot). Fixes [#2432](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2432).\n*   The Test Runner now retries node-originated errors from our internal API requests. Fixes [#2341](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2341)\n*   Fixed issue with multiple `readyStateChanges` with the same `readyState`. Fixes [#1150](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1150).\n*   Fixed Type error being thrown for users using TypeScript 3. Fixes [#2363](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2363).\n\n**Misc**\n\n*   We are now collecting more environment variables from runs when run in Semaphore, GitLab, Bitbucket, Team Foundation Server, Codeship, and Shippable. Fixes [#2460](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2460), [#2358](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2358), [#2343](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2343), and [#2453](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2453).\n*   The Test Runner's search now resets when switching between projects. Fixes [#2512](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2512).\n*   Fixed internal Cypress tests. Fixes [#2606](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2606).\n*   Replaced use of `new Buffer` with `Buffer.from`. Fixes [#2626](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2626).\n*   Allowed `autoScrollingEnabled` to be saved in `state.json`. Fixes [#2476](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2476).\n*   Fixed internal test error `beforeSpecRun is not a function`. Fixes [#2401](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2401).\n*   Switched our internal tests to use CircleCI workspaces. Fixes [#2398](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2398).\n*   Update TypeScript definition for [cy.screenshot()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/screenshot) to include screenshot specific options. Fixes [#2654](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2654).\n*   URLs printed within the CLI will now display as the color blue. Fixes [#2493](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2493).\n*   We began bulk converting some of our codebase from CoffeeScript to JavaScript. Fixes [#2686](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2686) and [#2687](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2687).\n*   We updated some of our internal ESLint rules to be more strict and also to help with CoffeeScript to JavaScript conversions. Fixes [#2688](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2688).\n\n**Documentation Changes:**\n\n*   Added `flag` option to [`cy.writeFile()` doc](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/writefile).\n*   Added `runUrl` to returned run in [Module API doc](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/module-api).\n*   Documented new `CYPRESS_DOWNLOAD_MIRROR` flag and rewrote advanced install instructions to be clearer in [Installing Cypress doc](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/advanced-installation).\n\n**Dependency Updates**\n\n*   Upgraded common-tags from `^1.4.0` to `^1.8.0` [#2415](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/2415)\n*   Upgraded @cypress/browserify-preprocessor from `1.1.0` to `1.1.1` [#2513](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2513)\n*   Upgraded lolex from `^1.5.2` to `^3.0.0` [#2570](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2570)\n*   Upgraded @types/jquery from `3.2.16` to `3.3.6` [#2363](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2363)\n*   Upgraded zunder from `5.6.5` to `6.1.1` [#2541](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2541)\n\n## 3.1.0[​](#3-1-0 \"Direct link to 3.1.0\")\n\n_Released 8/13/2018_\n\n**Summary:**\n\n*   Cypress can now run tests in parallel across multiple virtual machines, or can be parallelized on a single machine. Cypress will automatically figure out, detect, and load balance all of your specs in the fastest and most efficient way possible. There is no configuration other than passing a `--parallel` flag and spinning up multiple machines on your CI provider. From our experiments you can expect to see approximately 40% reduction in overall run time **per machine** you add. However, attempting to run in parallel on a single machine requires server grade hardware with dozens (or even hundreds) of CPU's and GB of RAM to run efficiently. A much better and simpler approach is to use a cluster of docker containers that are all isolated from each other. Any standard CI service (CircleCI, TravisCI, etc) comes with the ability to do this. We automatically tap into their environment variables to make parallelization possible without you having to configure anything.\n*   Beyond parallelization, you now have the ability to group multiple runs with each other so that they show up together (grouped) in the Dashboard. This enables you to test different applications, groups of specs, or different environments (like development, staging, production) and see all of the results together. We know how important cross browser testing is to everyone, so we built this to lead directly into aggregating the results of multiple browsers into a single run.\n*   The Dashboard Service has been updated to show you more visual information about what happened during a run. You can see how specs were parallelized and you can calculate the effect of adding or removing machines to help reduce the overall run time.\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   `cypress run` accepts a new [\\--parallel](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-run-parallel) flag to run specs in parallel. Fixes [#1690](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1690) and [#64](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/64) and [#2297](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2297).\n*   `cypress run` accepts a new [\\--group](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-run-group-lt-name-gt) flag to group multiple spec files within a single run. Fixes [#2169](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2169)\n*   `cypress run` accepts a new [`--ci-build-id`](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-run-ci-build-id-lt-id-gt) flag. Fixes [#2153](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2153).\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   We've finally tracked down the source of specs \"hanging\" and failing to start when running Electron. We finally tracked it down to a bug in Electron itself with setting `menu` when using offscreen rendering. Fixes [#2322](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2322) and [#2294](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2294) and [#1235](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1235) and [#1333](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1333).\n*   Clicking on svg elements is now working. 3.0.2 introduced a bug that would throw an 'illegal invocation' error. Fixes [#2245](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2245) and [#2252](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2252) and [#2258](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2258) and [#2277](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2277) and [#2288](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2288).\n*   Fixed a regression in `3.0.2` that caused typing `{enter}` not to submit a form when there were `<button>` elements other than `type='submit'`. Fixes [#2261](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2261) and [#2326](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2326).\n*   Fixed a small visual bug where failed commands were not aligned to other commands. Fixes [#2314](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2314).\n*   Fixes a race condition where async electron browser commands came in after the renderer had been destroyed, causing failures. Fixes [#2321](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2321).\n\n**Misc**\n\n*   When recording to the Dashboard Service, we now provide estimated durations per spec directly within the standard output, as long as the spec has had enough run history for this to be determined. Fixes [#2276](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2276).\n*   When using the new [\\--parallel](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-run-parallel) or [\\--group](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-run-group-lt-name-gt) feature, we now visually indicate that to you in the standard output when recording. Fixes [#2275](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2275).\n*   We have added support for more CI providers to automatically detect and show more relevant information in the Dashboard, instead of showing 'Unknown'. Fixes [#2146](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2146).\n*   We have added better checks and reliability for detecting runs in Jenkins. Fixes [#1990](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1990).\n*   The built in [`cypress-browserify-preprocessor`](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-browserify-preprocessor) was bumped to `1.1.0`. This supports more JavaScript features by default, including async/await, object rest spread, and class properties. Fixes [#2254](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2254).\n*   [cypress run](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-run) now creates a new browser profile per run per browser, but keeps the same browser profile when run via [cypress open](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-open). This means you can run Cypress locally over multiple processes and the browser profiles will not conflict with each other. Fixes [#1566](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1566).\n*   The Desktop-GUI has been updated to get the new routes provided by the Cypress API for runs. Fixes [#2189](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2189).\n*   Cypress now retries multiple times (with a backoff strategy) when communicating with our API fails while recording runs. This will provide better feedback in situations when the API is temporarily unavailable. Fixes [#1590](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1590).\n*   When Cypress retries due to an API timeout or failure it now displays a very nice message indicating to you the delay and number of retries left. Fixes [#2280](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2280).\n*   We've added parallelization to our own internal tests for the driver and the desktop-gui. We've been able to reduce the number of concurrent instances our tests use by 4, and shaved about 6 minutes off of each build. Faster with less resources. Fixes [#2325](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2325).\n\n**Documentation Changes:**\n\n*   [Added `Parallelization` doc.](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/cloud/smart-orchestration/parallelization)\n*   [Update `Dashboard Service` doc with new screenshots and run sections.](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/cloud/introduction)\n*   [Update `Command Line` doc with new flags and alphabetized flags.](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line)\n\n## 3.0.3[​](#3-0-3 \"Direct link to 3.0.3\")\n\n_Released 7/30/2018_\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Reverted the Chrome argument that disabled `RootLayerScrolling` which was used to prevent the application under test from \"shaking\" due to a bug in versions 66 and 67. This workaround inadvertently created a different and much more severe bug in Chrome 68 that would miscalculate pointer coordinates. This led to Cypress giving confusing errors about elements being covered up on action. This is still a bug in Chrome, and is fixed in Canary but has not yet been released to the stable Chrome 68 channel. Nevertheless, removing the `RootLayerScrolling` flag does fix it. We did several experiments to try to ensure that the \"shaking\" behavior does not exhibit itself in Chrome 68. We have limited the `--disable-blink-features=RootLayerScrolling` flag to Chrome 66 and Chrome 67. Fixes [#2223](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2223) and [#2215](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2215) and [#2037](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2037).\n*   Fixed another bug with Chrome that caused the `chromeWebSecurity: false` option to not be respected. This was due to Chrome progressively rolling out trials of a new option that attempts to isolate sites (and iframes) in their own child process if their origins are different. Fixes [#1951](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1951) and [#2001](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2001) and [#715](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/715).\n*   Fixed Cypress hanging in CI due to excessive and unnecessary globbing. We finally tracked down this issue which made it appear as if Cypress was \"hanging\" after closing a spec file and then attempting to open the next one. Fixes [#2183](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2183) and [#1905](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1905) and [#1912](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1912).\n*   We are now properly serializing nested object arguments when using the [Module API](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/module-api) via `cypress.open()` or `cypress.run()`. Passing nested objects in `reporterOptions` now works correctly. This is especially useful when using `mocha-multi-reporters`. In addition to fixing the [Module API](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/module-api), we are now also properly handling nested arguments from the [Command Line](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line). In order to pass nested objects within CLI params you must pass stringified JSON. This is useful for properties such as `blacklistHosts`. Fixes [#1348](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1348) and [#1357](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1357) and [#2221](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2221).\n*   Fixed a bug causing screenshots saved via [cy.screenshot()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/screenshot) to be in different folders when you ran using [cypress open](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-open) vs [cypress run](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-run) . Fixes [#2091](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2091).\n*   Fixed bugs with Electron losing focus when running headlessly via [cypress run](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-run) after navigation. Now the browser will always act as if it is focused no matter what and in all situations when running headlessly. If you were seeing focus related problems when running headlessly, this should fix them. Fixes issue [#2190](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2190).\n*   Fixed using when using [cy.click()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/click) on an element that bound to the `focus` event while the browser was currently _out of focus_. We have now normalized **all focus and blur events** to behave the same as if the browser is always in focus. This should fix the other batch of `blur` and `focus` issues that users have been experiencing. Fixes [#549](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/549) and [#2198](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2198).\n*   Fixed the vast majority of known issues with [.type()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/type). Fixes [#1241](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1241).\n*   Using [.type()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/type) on an input of type `email` or `number` will no longer fire unnecessary additional `blur` and `focus` events. Fixes [#2210](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2210).\n*   Fixed [.type()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/type) breaking on chains when passing the same `options` references. Fixes [#365](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/365).\n*   Fixed an issue with [.clear()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/clear) not behaving the same as `cy.type('{selectall}{backspace}')`. Fixes [#420](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/420).\n*   Fixed a bug with issuing an additional `blur` and `click` event when chaining `.clear().type(...)`. Fixes [#593](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/593).\n*   Fixed many issues with typing into `[contenteditable]` elements. WYSIWYG, [Draft.js](https://draftjs.org/) based, and other HTML editors now work correctly. Fixes [#596](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/596) and [#1686](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1686) and [#2096](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2096).\n*   The caret now correctly moves on `[contenteditable]` elements. Fixes [#1108](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1108).\n*   Fixed [.type()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/type) inserting a rogue `<br>` tag after the first letter in `[contenteditable]` elements. Fixes [#1926](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1926).\n*   Fixed issue where change events with [.type()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/type) would not fire correctly for many more situations and edge cases. Fixes [#651](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/651).\n*   Fixed issues with typing into JS based text-mask plugins. Basically anything that would alter the `.value` in response to certain events now works correctly. Fixes [#940](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/940) and [#1684](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1684).\n*   Using [.clear()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/clear) on an input with a `maxlength` attribute now works. Fixes [#1002](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1002) and [#2056](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2056).\n*   Fixed issues with [.type()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/type) not firing the `change` event on `input[type=number]`. Fixes [#1171](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1171).\n*   Fixed other event related issues with [.type()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/type) that were not firing correctly. Fixes [#1209](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1209).\n*   Fixed even more issues with [.type()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/type) not inserting characters on `input[type=number]`. Fixes [#1381](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1381).\n*   Fixed not being able to type negative numbers into `input[type=number]` elements. Fixes [#2173](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2173).\n*   Fixed `selectionStart` and `selectionEnd` with [.type()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/type) when using `{leftarrow}` or `{rightarrow}`. Fixes [#1234](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1234).\n*   Fixed not being able to type into a `datetime-local` input. Fixes [#1366](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1366).\n*   Calling [.focus()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/focus) or [.blur()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/blur) on [cy.window()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/window) no longer fires blur events on the `activeElement` or causes it to become `body`. Fixes [#2234](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2234).\n*   Using `cy.get('body').click()` now correctly changes the `activeElement` back to `body` and causes the existing `activeElement` to receive `blur`. Fixes [#2236](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2236).\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   We've loosened up the restrictions surrounding what we consider a typeable element. You can now type into inputs with invalid `type` attributes because the browser does still consider them regular `text` inputs and allows you to type into them. Fixes [#586](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/586).\n*   Using `{uparrow}` or `{downarrow}` with [.type()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/type) on an `input[type=number]` element now increments or decrements the number configured via the `step` attribute. Fixes [#2110](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2110).\n*   Using `{uparrow}` or `{downarrow}` with [.type()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/type) now correctly moves the cursor on `textarea` or `[contenteditable]` elements. Fixes [#2187](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2187).\n*   You can now use [.focus()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/focus) or [.blur()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/blur) on `cy.get('body')`. Fixes [#2235](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2235).\n*   Bumped the version in `junit` reporter dep from `1.12.1` to `1.17.0` which adds a few new features. Fixes [#2238](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2238).\n*   Bumped deps that `npm audit` was yelling about. Fixes [#1701](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1701).\n*   Runs showing up in the `Runs` tab now more closely match how they display in the Dashboard. Fixes [#2060](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2060).\n*   Added more debug logs. Fixes [#2108](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2108).\n*   When recording to the Dashboard we now more accurately collect commit details when it is missing from the local `git` data. Fixes [#2129](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2129) and [#2073](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2073).\n*   Updated build in example kitchen sink to `1.0.2`. Fixes [#2139](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2139).\n*   Updated the json-schema describing `videoCompression`. Allowing it to be a boolean. Fixes [#2140](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2140).\n\n**Documentation Changes:**\n\n*   [New \"Module API\" doc](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/module-api)\n\n## 3.0.2[​](#3-0-2 \"Direct link to 3.0.2\")\n\n_Released 6/28/2018_\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Screenshots taken with [cy.screenshot()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/screenshot) on 2x DPI are now taken at the correct full size. Fixes [#1857](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1857) and [#2018](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2018).\n*   Windows users no longer exit with `EPIPE` errors when running `cypress run` in newer versions of Node. Fixes [#1841](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1841) and [#2044](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2044).\n*   Fixed issue where applications programmatically stealing focus would lead to slow runs in Electron when running via `cypress run`. [#1909](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1909) and [#1892](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1892).\n*   Electron no longer reports the browser as out of focus when running via `cypress run`. Fixes [#1939](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1939).\n*   Modified the `document.hasFocus()` method to return `true` if the top window (Cypress window) is in focus. This should now correctly match how your application behaves outside of Cypress. Fixes [#1940](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1940).\n*   Fixed issue where Cypress would unnecessarily scroll when attempting to locate elements with `position: sticky`. Fixes [#1475](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1475).\n*   Fixed a bug where changing the [integrationFolder](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/legacy-configuration#Folders--Files) in Windows would lead to errors with plugins. Fixes [#1704](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1704).\n*   Cypress no longer crashes when a 3rd party server sends invalid `gzip` content. Also fixed issues with incorrectly gunzipping multibyte characters which would potentially lead to serving invalid HTML or JS. Fixes [#1396](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1396) and [#1756](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1756).\n*   The `--silent` flag should now be respected during `npm install cypress` on all OSes. Fixes [#817](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/817).\n*   Corrected a typo in the CLI for a warning message. Fixes [#2038](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2038).\n*   Fixed some areas of the Desktop GUI that did not display path names correctly in Windows. Fixes [#1830](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1830).\n*   The `pluginsFile` now supports an absolute path instead of just a relative one. Fixes [#1837](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1837).\n*   Fixed a regression introduced in `3.x.x` where application code that used `setTimeout` with a string argument would see the error `fn.apply is not a function`. Fixes [#1854](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1854).\n*   Fixed issue where preprocessor errors were being swallowed. Fixes [#1877](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1877).\n*   Fixed issue where Cypress would hang indefinitely when starting a new spec when in `cypress run` mode. Additionally we have optimized the code path to not read in the local `state.json` unnecessarily. Fixes [#2013](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2013) and [#1912](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1912) and [#1905](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1905) and [#1890](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1890).\n*   Fixed a couple regressions in the Dashboard where timed out runs stayed \"Pending\" forever. Fixes [#1891](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1891) and [#1952](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1952).\n*   Fixed another Dashboard regression where an error would throw when recording tests and sending a large list of specs. Fixes [#1901](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1901).\n*   Fixed issue where videos would not be recorded when an object was returned from `before:browser:launch` when in the Electron browser. Fixes [#1992](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1992).\n*   Fixed an issue where Cypress would inject content into the `<header>` tag instead of the `<head>` tag. Fixes [#2026](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2026).\n*   Fixed an oversight where a specific framebusting check was not being properly stripped and removed by the default config option [modifyObstructiveCode](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration#Browser). Fixes [#2030](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2030) and [#2059](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2059).\n*   Fixed icons visually shifting when tests were running in the Test Runner. Fixes [#1983](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1983).\n*   Server sent events now _finally_ work correctly in Cypress. Fixes [#1440](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1440) and [#1111](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1111).\n*   Time traveling snapshots now preserve the styles of empty `<style>` tags with programmatically inserted CSS rules. Fixes [#1226](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1226).\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   There are now several new CLI commands for interacting with the binary cache: [cypress cache path](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-cache-path), [cypress cache list](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-cache-list), and [cypress cache clear](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-cache-clear). Fixes [#1856](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1856).\n*   We've added a new CLI flag: `--no-exit` for [cypress run](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-run) to keep the browser open after the tests finish running. Fixes [#1871](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1871).\n*   The [CLI](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line) now respects config values and environment variables put in your `.npmrc` file. Fixes [#1399](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1399) and [#1853](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1853).\n*   Significantly improved the performance of taking screenshots. [#1863](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1863).\n*   Node module dependencies updated. Fixes [#1674](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1674) and [#1942](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1942).\n*   The bundled version of FFmpeg has now been bumped from `3.x.x` to `4.x.x`. This may help with some issues users were experiencing when recording videos. Fixes [#1972](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1972).\n*   Added more debug logs to FFmpeg to determine why FFmpeg compression sometimes causes Cypress to crash (mostly while running in Travis CI). Fixes [#1971](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1971).\n*   Several improvements to TypeScript typings. Fixes [#1881](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1881) and [#2007](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2007) and [#1899](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1899) and [#1902](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1902) and [#1897](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1897) and [#1907](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1907).\n*   We improved error logging and the user experience around [cypress verify](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-verify). Fixes [#1984](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1984).\n*   We no longer log the `skipping install` message if the Cypress binary is already installed locally. Fixes [#1985](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1985).\n*   Now, by default, screenshots are nested within a folder with the name of **the spec file** that is currently running. Example - the spec named `cypress/integration/foo/bar_spec.js` will save screenshots inside of this directory: `cypress/screenshots/foo/bar_spec.js/*`. Fixes [#1826](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1826).\n*   Passing `foo/bar/baz` as the fileName arg to [cy.screenshot()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/screenshot#Take-a-screenshot-and-save-in-a-specific-directory) inside a spec, `app.spec.js`, will now result in the screenshot being saved to a nested folder path such as: `cypress/screenshots/app.spec.js/foo/bar/baz.png`. Fixes [#1771](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1771) and [#668](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/668).\n*   We now append `(failed)` to the screenshot filename of screenshots taken automatically during test failure. Fixes [#1923](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1923).\n*   If multiple screenshots are taken during a test that will result in the same filename, their file paths are now appended with a number, i.e. `test name (1).png`. This prevents screenshot files with the same name from being overwritten. Fixes [#1766](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1766).\n*   Screenshot `onAfterScreenshot` and `onBeforeScreenshot` callbacks ar enow invoked for failed tests. They include a `testFailure` property to distinguish between automatic ones and your own use of `cy.screenshot()`. Fixes [#2040](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2040).\n*   There's now an [`after:screenshot` plugin event](https://docs.cypress.io/api/plugins/after-screenshot-api) you can use in your `pluginsFile` to work with screenshots after they are taken. This enables you to rename them, move their location, resize them, send them to a service, etc. Fixes [#2039](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/2039).\n*   Added `Cypress.browser` object which contains information about the currently running browser. Fixes [#1919](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1919) and [#1961](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1961).\n*   Added `Cypress.spec` object which contains information about the currently running spec. Fixes [#1918](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1918).\n*   URLs displayed in the Command Log during [cy.visit()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/visit) are no longer arbitrarily truncated at a set width. Fixes [#1995](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1995).\n\n**Documentation Changes:**\n\n*   [Update `cy.screenshot()` doc to include new file naming behavior](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/screenshot)\n*   [Updated \"Command Line\" doc to include new cache commands](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line)\n*   [Added `Cypress.browser` doc.](https://docs.cypress.io/api/cypress-api/browser)\n*   [Added `Cypress.spec` doc.](https://docs.cypress.io/api/cypress-api/spec)\n*   [Added `after:screenshot` plugin event doc.](https://docs.cypress.io/api/plugins/after-screenshot-api)\n\n## 3.0.1[​](#3-0-1 \"Direct link to 3.0.1\")\n\n_Released 5/30/2018_\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Seeded KitchenSink tests no longer fail. Fixes [#1812](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1812).\n*   The binary cache now correctly works and will not reinstall Cypress if an existing version is already installed. Fixes [#1813](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1813).\n*   Closing the `Electron` browser and then opening `Chrome` no longer causes `cy.screenshot()` to fail. Fixes [#1820](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1820).\n*   Fixed a bug with Windows users seeing crashes with `tty.getWindowSize is not a function`. Fixes [#1815](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1815) and [#1817](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1817).\n\n## 3.0.0[​](#3-0-0 \"Direct link to 3.0.0\")\n\n_Released 5/29/2018_\n\n**Summary:**\n\n*   There is a new [`cy.task()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/task) command that enables you to go outside the browser to perform tasks directly in `node`. This will make it easy to setup, scaffold, seed, talk to your database, or anything else useful on a back end.\n*   [`cy.screenshot()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/screenshot) has been rewritten from the ground up. It now takes a screenshot of **only** the application under test by default. It also can take full page screenshots or element only screenshots. This is the first step of Cypress Dashboard support for screenshot diffing.\n*   When running with `cypress run` we now run each spec file in isolation from others. We have rewritten our reporter to provide more details and provide a summary of the run at the bottom.\n*   The Dashboard has been upgraded to make it easier to understand the results of each spec run. This was done in anticipation of providing you the ability to parallelize and load balance your spec files automatically in CI.\n*   We are now capturing the performance and timings data of every test when using `--record` mode and are beginning to offer the first analytics and insights into the health of your tests on our Dashboard Service.\n*   Cypress now caches globally per version which prevents it from being installed multiple times across projects.\n\n**Breaking Changes:**\n\n*   We now run each spec file in isolation from one another. This _shouldn't_ technically break anything, but if you have set up your tests in a way that requires the state of a previous spec file, this could potentially break your tests. This will go a long ways towards reducing problems we were seeing with long runs in CI. Fixes [#431](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/431), [#681](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/681), [#1589](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1589), [#1539](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1539), and [#1692](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1692).\n*   The environment variable `CYPRESS_BINARY_VERSION` has been removed. You should use the equivalent environment variable `CYPRESS_INSTALL_BINARY` instead.\n*   The environment variable `CYPRESS_SKIP_BINARY_INSTALL` has been removed. To skip the binary install, set `CYPRESS_INSTALL_BINARY=0`.\n*   `screenshotOnHeadlessFailure` has been removed as an option in `cypress.json`. Instead you can now control this behavior directly with code by setting `screenshotOnRunFailure` to `false` within the new [Screenshot API](https://docs.cypress.io/api/cypress-api/screenshot-api). Fixes [#1140](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1140) and [#1754](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1754).\n*   `trashAssetsBeforeHeadlessRuns` has been renamed to `trashAssetsBeforeRuns` in our configuration. Fixes [#1754](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1754).\n*   `videoRecording` has been renamed to `video` in our configuration to be clearer and prevent confusion about recording to our Dashboard. Fixes [#562](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/562).\n*   Cypress no longer copies screenshots and videos to artifacts for CircleCI. Copying artifacts should be left up to the user to [handle themselves in their `circle.yml` file](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/artifacts/). Fixes [#1592](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1592).\n*   The standard output has been redesigned to better visualize spec files running in isolation and to be more visually appealing. This may break any specialized logic written that expected the standard output to be structured in a specific way or contain specific words. Fixes [#1588](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1588).\n*   [`cy.screenshot()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/screenshot) no longer takes a screenshot of the runner by default. Instead it will hide the runner, remove application scaling and then scroll to take a full page picture of your application.\n*   `before` and `after` hooks within a [support file](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/writing-and-organizing-tests#Support-file) now run before/after every spec file, instead of only once before/after the entire run. [#681](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/681)\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   There is a new [`cy.task()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/task) command for executing any arbitrary `node` code.\n*   You can now run multiple specs by passing a glob to the `--spec` argument of `cypress run`. Fixes [#263](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/263), [#416](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/416) and [#681](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/681).\n*   There is a new [Screenshot API](https://docs.cypress.io/api/cypress-api/screenshot-api) and new [`cy.screenshot()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/screenshot) options that allow you set defaults for how screenshots are captured, whether to scale your app, disable timers and animations, or which elements to black out in the screenshot. You can also set defaults for whether to automatically take screenshots when there are test failures or whether to wait for the Command Log to synchronize before taking the screenshot. Fixes [#1424](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1424).\n*   [`cy.screenshot()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/screenshot) can now be chained off of commands that yield a DOM element and will only take a screenshot that element.\n*   During install of cypress, the Cypress binary is now downloaded to a global cache. This prevents multiple projects from downloading the same Cypress version. Fixes [#1300](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1300).\n*   The seeded `example_spec.js` file has been replaced by an `examples` folder with several spec files. This more closely reflects the recommended use of Cypress - as smaller groups of tests split among many files that will now be run in isolation. The tests were also updated from ES5 to ES6. You can see all changes in the [`cypress-example-kitchensink` repo](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-example-kitchensink) Fixes [#1460](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1460).\n*   Cypress now watches all the `plugins file`'s entire dependency tree to make iterating on plugins easier. Fixes [#1407](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1407).\n*   Videos will now be saved locally with a filename named after the associated `spec` file that it represents. Fixes [#980](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/980).\n*   The Test Runner now displays `skipped` tests differently than `pending` tests. [#244](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/244).\n*   Standard output now displays the number of `skipped` tests within the summary output during `cypress run`. [#1559](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1559).\n*   The url to view the run in the Dashboard is now printed to output during `cypress run`. [#494](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/494).\n*   We now print the browser and browser version run in the output during `cypress run`. [#833](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/833).\n*   The build number and url to CI for tests run within [Drone](https://drone.io/) are now captured and displayed on the run within the Dashboard. [#1709](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1709).\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Cypress no longer crashes when attempting to proxy a WebSocket connection that fails. Fixes [#556](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/556).\n*   Asserting that an attribute equals a falsy value no longer fails when the value was falsy. Fixes [#831](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/831) and [#1491](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1491).\n*   Snapshots now ignore stylesheets with `media=\"print\"`. Fixes [#1568](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1568).\n*   Fixed issue where the Cypress `window` was being returned instead of AUT's `window`. Fixes [#1436](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1436).\n*   The `close` event now properly fires on `file` when manually closing the browser. Fixes [#1560](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1560).\n*   `cypress.env.json` is now being watched for changes. Fixes [#1464](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1464).\n*   Fixed issue when using TypeScript that caused namespace errors to be thrown. Fixes [#1627](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1627).\n*   Fixed error message on [.type()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/type) and [.clear()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/clear) when typing into non-typeable elements or clearing non-clearable elements to accurately list the elements allowed. Fixes [#1650](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1650).\n*   Added Chrome flag `--disable-blink-features=RootLayerScrolling` to prevent the application under test from \"shaking\" in recent versions of Chrome. Fixes [#1620](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1620).\n*   Fixed issue where some TTY characters were not properly formatted in the terminal for Windows during `cypress run`. Fixes [#1143](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1143) and [#1550](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1550).\n*   Removed an extraneous error display from Electron during `cypress run` about a \"transparent titlebar\" setting. Fixes [#1745](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1745).\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   We are now aggressively turning on colors when running in CI. If you're using Jenkins and **do not** have an ANSI color plugin installed, you can turn off colors with the `NO_COLOR=1` environment variable. Fixes [#1747](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1747) and [#1748](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1748).\n*   When running `cypress run --record` on forked PR's, we now detect that the Record Key is missing and do not fail the build. We will display a warning, but continue running the tests. Fixes [#1193](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1193).\n*   Searching in the Test Runner now filters out any non-matching folders. Fixes [#1706](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1706).\n*   Duplicate, subsequent logs in the Command Log are now collapsed and can be expanded to view all logs. Fixes [#1580](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1580).\n*   We now throw a descriptive error if an alias using [.as()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/as) was defined starting with the `@` character. [#1643](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1643).\n*   We now pass the `--disable-device-discovery-notifications` flag automatically. This should prevent Chromium browser from automatically trying to communicate with devices in your network, such as printers, while running tests. Fixes [#1600](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1600).\n*   We now pass any reporter errors along and provide a stack if a custom reporter you've provided does not exist. Fixes [#1192](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1192).\n*   You can now pass a normal object to `cypress.open()` or `cypress.run()` through the [Module API](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/module-api), just as you would from the command line. [#1442](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1442).\n*   Added type definitions for `Cypress.off` and `Cypress.log`. Fixes [#1110](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1110) and [#1591](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1591).\n*   Update type definitions for [`cy.screenshot()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/screenshot) to reflect new changes to command's options. Fixes [#1753](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1753).\n*   The type definition for [`.filter()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/filter) now correctly supports a function argument.\n*   The type definition for [`.scrollIntoView()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/scrollIntoView) no longer errors when passed a `duration` option. Fixes [#1606](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1606).\n*   `NODE_OPTIONS` environment variables now print within the `cypress:cli` logs when running in `DEBUG` mode. Although using `NODE_OPTIONS` themselves should not be used due to [#1676](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1676). Fixes [#1673](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1673).\n*   Cypress will error and exit with status 1 if no specs were found during `cypress run`. Fixes [#1585](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1585).\n*   We are now counting and aggregating the stats at the end of test runs separately from Mocha. Cypress considers a test to be the `it` and any accompanying `hooks` that run before or after a test. Cypress will correctly associate failures in those hooks to the test itself. We believe this more accurately models and just \"makes sense\". Fixes [#1163](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1163).\n*   The minimum viewport size has been lowered from `200` pixels to `20` pixels. Fixes [#1169](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1169) and [#1444](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1444).\n*   Internal changes to our API structure and communication. Fixes [#1170](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1170), [#1413](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1413), [#1415](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1415).\n*   We output a much more complete test results object when using cypress as a module. Fixes [#1248](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1248).\n*   Added keywords to Cypress npm package. Fixes [#1508](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1508).\n*   Centered the animating icon in the Test Runner when 'running'. Fixes [#1695](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1695).\n*   We made some changes to internal references of `headed` and `headless` to be more specific and instead reference `run mode` and `interactive mode`. Fixes [#1140](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1140).\n*   The test name text is now selectable inside the Command Log. Fixes [#1476](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1476).\n*   Minor improvements to contributing docs and scripts. Fixes [#1665](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1665).\n*   We now collect Semaphore CI params and provide URL's to click into the builds from the Dashboard. Fixes [#1785](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1785).\n*   Config overrides coming from the CLI or environment variables are now validated the same way as if they've been set in `cypress.json`. Fixes [#1783](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1783).\n*   There is a better / more helpful experience around passing unknown options to the CLI. Fixes [#837](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/837).\n*   Display an empty message when there is no commit information on recorded runs. Fixes [#1809](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1809).\n\n**Documentation Changes:**\n\n*   [New `cy.task()` doc](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/task)\n*   [New `Screenshot API` doc](https://docs.cypress.io/api/cypress-api/screenshot-api)\n*   [Update `cy.screenshot()` doc to include new accepted usage and options](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/screenshot)\n*   [Update `Installing Cypress` doc to include new options for Cypress binary caching](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress)\n*   [Updated `Writing and Organizing Tests` to include newly seeded `examples` folder](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/writing-and-organizing-tests)\n*   [Updated `cypress run` spec args](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-run)\n*   [Updated `Dashboard Service`](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/cloud/introduction)\n*   [Updated `Launching Browsers` to include our disabling of device discovery notifications](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/launching-browsers)\n*   [Updated `Preprocessors` to reflect all ways `close` event could be triggered](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/cloud/introduction)\n*   Updated use of \"running headlessly\" to more accurate \"during `cypress run`\"\n\n## 2.1.0[​](#2-1-0 \"Direct link to 2.1.0\")\n\n_Released 3/1/2018_\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Prevent a bug with `node-sass` on OSX + Windows when local `node` version does not match bundled `node` when importing components directly in spec files. The underlying issue was because we forgot to update `Buildkite` and `Appveyor` when we upgraded `Electron` in `2.0.0`. Fixes [#1387](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1387) and [#1390](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1390).\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   The [Selector Playground](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/cypress-app#Selector-Playground) has been updated to automatically prefer `data-cy`, `data-test` or `data-testid` attributes when providing the unique selector for an element. Additionally it now exposes a [public API](https://docs.cypress.io/api/cypress-api/selector-playground-api) that you can use to control how it determines which selector to use. Fixes [#1135](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1135).\n\n**Documentation Changes:**\n\n*   [Added `Selector Playground Guide`](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/cypress-app#Selector-Playground)\n*   [Added `Selector Playground API`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/cypress-api/selector-playground-api)\n*   [Updated `Best Practices`](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/best-practices)\n*   [Updated `FAQ`](https://docs.cypress.io/faq/questions/using-cypress-faq)\n*   [Updated `Introduction to Cypress`](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/introduction-to-cypress)\n\n## 2.0.4[​](#2-0-4 \"Direct link to 2.0.4\")\n\n_Released 2/25/2018_\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   The `cypress` npm package now has the correct `engines` set in `package.json`. This was accidentally getting overwritten and caused errors when `engineStrict` was set in environments using `node` older than `8.2.1`. Fixes [#1373](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1373).\n\n## 2.0.3[​](#2-0-3 \"Direct link to 2.0.3\")\n\n_Released 2/21/2018_\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   The runner no longer appears to \"hang\" if a `before` hook fails in a test with siblings. Previously the test would never generate a `status` and look pending forever. This was a visual bug only. Fixes [#1343](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1343).\n*   The Desktop GUI properly renders folders that contain specs in Windows now. Fixes [#1335](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1335).\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   The viewport dropdown helper in the Runner now displays string quoted JSON instead of an object literal. This better matches how you should write those options in `cypress.json`. Fixes [#1350](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1350).\n\n## 2.0.2[​](#2-0-2 \"Direct link to 2.0.2\")\n\n_Released 2/17/2018_\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Fixed more edge cases where legitimate JavaScript code was being modified unexpectedly by the [modifyObstructiveCode](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration#Browser) configuration. We've tightened up the RegExp even more and added 40 popular JS libraries to test against to ensure they are not modified. Fixes [#1334](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1334).\n*   Fixed an edge case when hooks such as `beforeEach` or `afterEach` threw an **identical** error message, Cypress would hang indefinitely and never finish running the tests. Fixes [#674](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/674).\n*   Fixed bug when `Errors` that threw with no arguments: `throw new Error()` and had their messages appended would duplicate the message over and over again. Fixes [#1338](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1338).\n\n## 2.0.1[​](#2-0-1 \"Direct link to 2.0.1\")\n\n_Released 2/16/2018_\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Using [cy.contains()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/contains) with a RegExp argument is now properly escaped. Fixes [#1322](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1322).\n*   Fixed a runaway RegExp causing large `.js` files to take dozens of seconds to process. This was a regression caused by `2.0.0` with the new [modifyObstructiveCode](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration#Browser) option. We've optimized the RegExp and the performance is back to being almost identical to transparently passing responses through. Fixes [#1330](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1330).\n\n## 2.0.0[​](#2-0-0 \"Direct link to 2.0.0\")\n\n_Released 2/15/2018_\n\n**Breaking Changes:**\n\n*   The built in default `Electron` browser has been bumped from version `53` to `59`. This version represents the version of `Chromium` that Electron is using. In other words, running `cypress run` (or via `Electron`) will be like running your tests in `Chrome 59` now. Although it is unlikely this would actually _break_ any of your tests - it is technically possible they could behave differently. Fixes [#895](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/895) and [#891](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/891) and [#823](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/823) and [#860](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/860) and [#1011](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1011) and [#1252](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1252) and [#1276](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1276).\n*   We are now detecting and automatically stripping code that obstructs Cypress from being able to test your application. Specifically, we are removing JavaScript code that tries to prevent **clickjacking** and **framebusting**. We have written very conservative rules that do their best to **only** strip these specific JS snippets, but it is technically possible that it may unintentionally rewrite valid JS if they match the RegExp patterns. There is a new configuration option called [modifyObstructiveCode](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration#Browser) that is `true` by default. If you are experiencing problems after upgrading, you can turn this off and this will disable modifying your JS code. If you were using Cypress and upon visiting your website you would experience seemingly \"random\" redirects - these problems should now be eliminated. Fixes [#886](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/886) and [#1245](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1245) and [#1064](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1064) and [#992](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/992) and [#692](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/692) and [#352](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/352).\n*   We are now clearing the browser's disk cache each time it opens (before any tests run). This means that any files that have been cached from `Cache-Control` headers will be cleaned and removed. In the future, we will expose a new `cy.clearCache()` method to provide finer grained control of clearing the cache on a per test basis. But for now, this is an improvement. Fixes [#1124](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1124).\n*   The `--spec` option is now normalized against the current working directory `cwd` instead of the project that you are running Cypress in. That means passing a path from the command line to a spec file will now work even when the project path is not `cwd`. Fixes [#1159](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1159).\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   [blacklistHosts](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration#Browser) would occasionally not work if you were blocking a host that had previously cached a file. In this case, the browser would serve it from disk and not make an actual HTTP request. This issue has been solved by clearing the cache when the browser opens. Fixes [#1154](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1154).\n*   [blacklistHosts](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration#Browser) is now correctly accepted via the `--config` CLI flag.\n*   Spies and Stubs created with [cy.stub()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/stub) and [cy.spy()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/spy) will now retry their assertions when utilized from an [alias](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/as). Fixes [#1156](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1156).\n*   Basic auth is working again in Chrome 63 and Chrome 64. We \"for real\" fixed it this time by adding auth headers automatically at the network proxy layer and bypassed the browser altogether. We automatically apply auth headers if you provide a username/password in the URL of a `cy.visit(url)`. We also added a new `auth` option to specify the `username/password` using `cy.visit(url, options)`. All of the requests that match the origin of the URL will have the `Authorization: Basic <...>` headers added. Fixes [#1288](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1288).\n*   Fixed domain parsing failures when `local` or `localhost` was not used as a `tld`. Fixes [#1292](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1292) and [#1278](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1278).\n*   Removed the flag `--disable-background-networking` from the Chrome launch args to fix problems in CI that would throttle XHR callbacks by up to 20-30 seconds. Fixes [#1320](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1320).\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   We now properly display nested objects and arrays that come from `cypress.json` in the Settings tab in the Desktop Application.\n*   There's now a proper \"empty view\" when you go to setup your project to record on our Dashboard and you have not created any Organizations. Fixes [#1306](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1306).\n*   Removed the message about private projects requiring a paid account in the future. There will be a free tier including private projects. Fixes [#827](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/827).\n*   We moved the location of the browser's disk cache. That means that if you've been using Cypress for a really long time - you may have built up quite a large existing cache (in the hundreds of `mb`). Before upgrading, you should open the browser and then manually clear the Cache. Or - if you have already upgraded to `2.0.0` delete the following folders:\n    *   OSX: `~/Library/Caches/Cypress`\n    *   Linux: `~/.cache/Cypress`\n    *   Windows: `%APPDATA%\\Cypress\\cy\\production\\browsers`\n\n## 1.4.2[​](#1-4-2 \"Direct link to 1.4.2\")\n\n_Released 2/4/2018_\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Fixed not being able to visit subdomains when using 2nd level sub domains. Fixes [#1175](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1175) and [#600](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/600).\n*   Fixed not being able to visit private TLD's from the public suffix such as `github.io`, `gitlab.io` or `herokuapp.com`. These now all work correctly. Fixes [#380](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/380) and [#402](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/402) and [#802](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/802) and [#493](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/493) and [#1161](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1161).\n*   Fixed not being able to visit URLs that used `*localhost` such as `http://app.localhost:8080`. Fixes [#451](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/451).\n*   Mochawesome now works correctly and outputs files in all versions. Fixes [#551](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/551).\n*   Mochawesome will exit correctly with code `1` when a hook fails. [#1063](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1063).\n*   Fixed some incorrect typings with TypeScript. Fixes [#1219](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1219) and [#1186](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1186).\n*   Fixed bug with custom 3rd party Mocha reporters relying on `test.titlePath` being a function. Fixes [#1142](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1142).\n*   Fixed typo in `cypress.schema.json`. Fixes [#1167](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1167).\n*   Fixed typo in CLI deps error about Docker. Fixes [#1136](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1136).\n*   Prevent `NODE_ENV` from being set to `undefined` when parent process did not have it defined. Fixes [#1223](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1223).\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   We have begun to aggregate failures and other stats ourselves instead of relying on Mocha reporters. Fixes [#1141](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1141).\n*   Added TypeScript `should/and` autocomplete and typings for Cypress events. Fixes [#1187](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1187) and [#1132](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1132).\n*   Upgrade deps. Fixes [#1174](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1174).\n\n## 1.4.1[​](#1-4-1 \"Direct link to 1.4.1\")\n\n_Released 12/26/2017_\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Using `DEBUG=cypress:*` now correctly outputs all debugging information on OSX and Linux. Previously output other then `cypress:cli` was ignored due to the CLI ignoring `stderr` from the binary. Fixes [#921](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/921).\n*   `stdout` is now captured correctly in Windows when recording to the Dashboard. Fixes [#977](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/977) and issue [#711](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/711).\n*   Windows now forcibly displays colors correctly to the terminal. Fixes [#1127](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1127).\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   `TTY` is now handled correctly for Linux and OSX. This means that CI providers which turned off colors due to `TTY` being false will now display colors again such as TravisCI. Fixes [#1126](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1126).\n*   We now handle Xvfb exiting with a non zero status code and display that error to you. This should help with situations where Xvfb is misconfigured on the system. Fixes [#1113](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1113).\n*   We've added debug output for Xvfb when `DEBUG=cypress:xvfb` is enabled. Helpful when diagnosing problems with Xvfb. Fixes [#1128](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1128).\n*   We've added more TypeScript documentation for `cy.*` methods. Fixes [#1117](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1117).\n*   When developing on Cypress, we now start the process through the CLI to bring it into parity with how it works when used in production. Fixes [#838](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/838).\n*   Upgraded various CLI dependencies that were flagged for security warnings. There wasn't an actual security problem - just static analyzers complaining. Fixes [#1103](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1103).\n\n## 1.4.0[​](#1-4-0 \"Direct link to 1.4.0\")\n\n_Released 12/19/2017_\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   There is now a Search Bar in the Desktop GUI that enables you to filter the list of specs. Helpful for projects with a ton of spec files. Fixes [#1098](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1098).\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   The seeded `example_spec.js` file no longer fails in Windows on the [cy.exec()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/exec) test. It now conditionally runs a command appropriate for Windows. Fixes [#1097](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1097).\n*   Trying to log in to Cypress no longer causes the app to crash. This area has had many more tests added. Fixes [#1093](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1093).\n*   Some minor improvements to TypeScript definitions around [.then()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/then). Fixes [#1084](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1084).\n*   The Selector Playground now works correctly in the Electron browser. Fixes [#1086](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1086).\n\n## 1.3.0[​](#1-3-0 \"Direct link to 1.3.0\")\n\n_Released 12/17/2017_\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   Plugins now emit a [before:browser:launch](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/tooling/plugins-guide#Browser-Launching) event exposing you the browser that will be launched and its launch arguments. This enables you to modify the arguments prior to launching the browser. You can also use these arguments to modify how Chrome runs and to also test Chrome extensions. Fixes [#691](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/691) and [#298](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/298).\n*   We have launched a \"CSS Selector Playground\", a new UI button in the Test Runner that enables you to highlight elements in your application and receive a unique selector. You can also find elements by their text content. These mimics [cy.get()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/get) and [cy.contains()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/contains) behavior. Additionally you can copy the generated Cypress command to your clipboard or output the generated selector to your console. This feature is in beta. It only works in Chrome (not in Electron). We are aware of some bugs in it, but it is good enough for use and feedback. Please check out issue [#917](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/917), watch an animated gif demonstration, and leave any feedback you have there. Fixes [#917](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/917).\n\nDocumentation Changes:\n\n*   [Added `Browser Launch API`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/plugins/browser-launch-api)\n*   [Updated `Plugins Guide`](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/tooling/plugins-guide)\n*   [Updated `Writing a Plugin API`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/plugins/writing-a-plugin)\n\n## 1.2.0[​](#1-2-0 \"Direct link to 1.2.0\")\n\n_Released 12/14/2017_\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   Plugins can now return a `Promise` and modify the yielded `config` to set new configuration values and environment variables. Fixes [#1042](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1042) and [#909](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/909) and [#576](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/576).\n*   There is a new [userAgent](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration#Browser) option in `cypress.json`. This enables you to change the `userAgent` of the browser for the entire browsing session. Fixes [#364](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/364).\n*   There is a new [blacklistHosts](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration#Browser) option in `cypress.json` that allows you to block requests made to those hosts. Blocked requests will respond with a `503` status code. This is useful for blocking 3rd party domains like Google Analytics. We have added a [new 'Stubbing Google Analytics' recipe](https://docs.cypress.io/examples/recipes#Stubbing-and-spying) demonstrating this. Fixes [#442](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/442).\n*   Added chai assertions in TypeScript to generate autocompletion. Fixes [#1073](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1073).\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Updated TypeScript definitions to more accurately match the current Cypress API. Fixes [#1050](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1050). Also note that if you were extending Cypress in TypeScript the `Chainer` interface changed. Please read issue #1048 to understand what you will need to update.\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   Renamed `environmentVariables` to `env` in the Desktop GUI. Fixes [#1052](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1052).\n*   [Cypress.config()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/cypress-api/config) now returns a complete set of configuration values. Fixes [#509](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/509).\n*   Added TypeScript typings for bundled Cypress tools like `$`, `_`, etc. Fixes [#1046](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1046).\n*   Some error messages were made more passive. Fixes [#1025](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1025).\n\n**Documentation Changes:**\n\n*   [Added `Configuration API`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/plugins/configuration-api)\n*   [Added `Recipes`](https://docs.cypress.io/examples/recipes)\n*   [Updated `Configuration`](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration)\n*   [Updated `Environment Variables`](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/environment-variables)\n*   [Updated `Using Cypress FAQ`](https://docs.cypress.io/faq/questions/using-cypress-faq)\n*   [Updated `Plugins Guide`](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/tooling/plugins-guide)\n*   [Updated `Writing a Plugin API`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/plugins/writing-a-plugin)\n\n## 1.1.4[​](#1-1-4 \"Direct link to 1.1.4\")\n\n_Released 12/6/2017_\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Fixed an issue causing `Chrome` to timeout when attempted to be run through our docker containers. Fixes [#1031](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1031).\n*   Several TypeScript typings were added, updated and fixed. Fixes [#1006](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1006).\n*   Using a regular `http://` URL now works when using the `CYPRESS_BINARY_VERSION` flag to point the binary at an external location. Fixes [#1001](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1001).\n*   File watching is fixed (again) when changing between specs. Fixes [#1018](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1018).\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   There is now a new [`CYPRESS_SKIP_BINARY_INSTALL`](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/advanced-installation#Environment-variables) flag you can pass during `npm install` which skips the binary installation after the `cypress` npm module completes its installation. Fixes [#1005](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1005).\n*   We now launch Chrome with `--no-sandbox` and `--disable-gpu` options in Linux. We will soon release a new plugin event that enables you to modify the browser arguments we use by default. This _shouldn't_ cause issues with existing Linux users, and instead it should fix many CI setups that were using our Docker containers or your own home grown installed Chrome setup. Fixes [#1021](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1021) and [#1020](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1020).\n*   Removed several aliases from our browser detector. These were not implemented properly and not needed - and thus only caused indirection. Fixes [#1023](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1023).\n\n## 1.1.3[​](#1-1-3 \"Direct link to 1.1.3\")\n\n_Released 12/3/2017_\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   JSON fixtures with unicode escape sequences are now parsed correctly. Fixes [#964](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/964).\n*   The default `browserify` plugin no longer fires `watched:file:changed` twice leading to an uncaught exception that was popping up in the console. Also fixed a minor state bug in the `browserify` package. Fixes [#968](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/968).\n*   Cypress no longer reports `Electron` as the browser that ran in the Dashboard Service when a different browser was run. Fixes [#854](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/854).\n*   Invalid cookie values no longer crash Cypress. Fixes [#962](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/962).\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   We are now bundling our own `TypeScript` definitions with the `cypress` npm module. You no longer have to install `@types/cypress` anymore. We'll continue to keep these updated with API changes. Fixes [#856](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/856).\n*   Uncaught exceptions originating from **your** application code and/or test code are now **distinctly** and **clearly** indicated in the error message. We included a link to our docs to educate you on how you can optionally disable Cypress from catching these. Fixes [#825](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/825).\n*   [cy.visit()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/visit) now accepts `{ failOnStatusCode: false }` which enables you to visit pages that respond with a non `2xx` status code. This brings it into parity with [cy.request()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/request). Fixes [#421](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/421) and [#574](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/574).\n*   The contributing Readme's have been updated and improved for each package. Fixes [#995](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/995).\n*   Added utility methods [Cypress.platform](https://docs.cypress.io/api/cypress-api/platform) and [Cypress.arch](https://docs.cypress.io/api/cypress-api/arch) for returning the underlying OS information. Uses node's `os` module under the hood. Fixes [#824](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/824) and [#675](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/675).\n\n**Documentation Changes:**\n\n*   [Added `Cypress.version`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/cypress-api/version)\n*   [Added `Cypress.arch`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/cypress-api/arch)\n*   [Added `Cypress.platform`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/cypress-api/platform)\n\n## 1.1.2[​](#1-1-2 \"Direct link to 1.1.2\")\n\n_Released 11/26/2017_\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Fixed a regression caused by [.type()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/type) adhering to `maxlength` incorrectly. Special character sequences were not respected. Now [.type()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/type) works with special characters and implements a complete fix for `maxlength`. In addition to it working, it now fires all applicable browser events without modifying the actual input value. Fixes [#955](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/955).\n*   Errors coming from plugins now display correctly in the Test Runner. Fixes [#945](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/945).\n\n**Documentation Changes:**\n\n*   [Added ESLint, Docker, and TypeScript to Plugins](https://docs.cypress.io/plugins)\n*   [Added recipe for TypeScript with Browserify](https://docs.cypress.io/examples/recipes)\n*   [Added recipe for TypeScript with webpack](https://docs.cypress.io/examples/recipes)\n*   [Added recipe for Direct Controlling AngularJS](https://docs.cypress.io/examples/recipes)\n*   [Added recipe for E2E API Testing](https://docs.cypress.io/examples/recipes)\n*   [Added more video tutorials](https://docs.cypress.io/examples/tutorials)\n*   [Improved displaying list of Tutorials, Recipes, Applications, and Docker examples](https://docs.cypress.io/examples/recipes)\n\n## 1.1.1[​](#1-1-1 \"Direct link to 1.1.1\")\n\n_Released 11/20/2017_\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Fixed a bug swallowing plugin errors due to undefined `reject` function. Fixes [#934](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/934).\n*   [.type()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/type) now respects the `maxlength` attribute and will not type beyond it. Fixes [#928](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/928).\n\n## 1.1.0[​](#1-1-0 \"Direct link to 1.1.0\")\n\n_Released 11/19/2017_\n\n**Summary:**\n\n*   We have officially launched the new **Plugins API** interface. This adds a `cypress/plugins/index.js` file to new and existing projects. Using this file will enable you to modify the internals of Cypress running in the background `node` process. This means you will be able to use `node` APIs that are executed outside of the browser.\n*   We have currently added only [one event](https://docs.cypress.io/api/plugins/writing-a-plugin#List-of-events) for modifying the test file preprocessor, but this paves the way for adding many more event types. You can now modify every aspect of how files are sent to the browser.\n*   We have extracted the default Browserify preprocessor into its own package - [`@cypress/browserify-preprocessor`](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-browserify-preprocessor). This is bundled with Cypress, but it is extracted so it can be used / modified by you to change the default options we pass to Browserify. Additionally, you can swap out this preprocessor for something else entirely.\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   There is now a [Plugins API interface](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/tooling/plugins-guide). Partially addresses [#684](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/684).\n*   We have added the first Plugin API event called: [file:preprocessor](https://docs.cypress.io/api/plugins/writing-a-plugin#List-of-events). Fixes [#580](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/580) and [#581](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/581).\n*   You can now customize the default Babe; configuration options for the Browserify preprocessor. Fixes [#343](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/343) and [#905](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/905).\n*   CoffeeScript 2 is supported via modifying the default options for the Browserify preprocessor. Fixes [#663](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/663).\n*   You can swap out or extend the default preprocessor to do exotic things like compile ClojureScript into JavaScript. Fixes [#533](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/533).\n*   We have created a [`@cypress/webpack-preprocessor`](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/tree/master/npm/webpack-preprocessor) preprocessor npm package for you webpack users (because we are nice!). Fixes [#676](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/676).\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   [`cy.contains(selector, regexp)`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/contains) now works as intended. Fixes [#801](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/801).\n*   We no longer format fixtures in any capacity. This fixes a bug with improperly formatting fixtures in Windows. You should handle formatting fixtures yourself. Fixes [#884](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/884) and [#902](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/902).\n*   [cy.viewport()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/viewport) resolves if only width or only height changes. Fixes [#873](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/873).\n*   Cypress now auto reloads when spec files are modified in Windows. Fixes [#712](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/712).\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   There is a new `--global` option useful with [cypress open](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-open) to force Cypress to open in global mode. This is helpful when you have multiple nested Cypress projects but only want to install Cypress once in the root project. Fixes [#889](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/889).\n*   The [module API](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/module-api) accepts `reporterOptions` as an object literal like it does for the `env` and `config` properties. Fixes [#899](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/899).\n\n**Documentation Changes:**\n\n*   [Created \"Testing React TodoMVC\" tutorials](https://docs.cypress.io/examples/tutorials)\n*   [Created \"Variables and Aliases\" core concept](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/variables-and-aliases)\n*   [Created \"Conditional Testing\" core concept](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/conditional-testing)\n*   [Created \"Plugins\" guide](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/tooling/plugins-guide)\n*   [Created \"List of Plugins\"](https://docs.cypress.io/plugins)\n*   [Created \"Writing a Plugin\" API](https://docs.cypress.io/api/plugins/writing-a-plugin)\n*   [Created \"Preprocessors API\"](https://docs.cypress.io/api/plugins/preprocessors-api)\n*   [Updated \"Using Cypress FAQ\"](https://docs.cypress.io/faq/questions/using-cypress-faq)\n*   [Updated \"Best Practices\"](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/best-practices)\n\n## 1.0.3[​](#1-0-3 \"Direct link to 1.0.3\")\n\n_Released 10/29/2017_\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   The Test Runner now enables you to collapse folders when displaying a list of specs. Fixes [#760](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/760).\n\n**Bugfixes**\n\n*   The `onChange` event callback for React now works (again) on `input` type `number` or `email`. Fixes [#816](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/816) and [#770](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/770).\n*   Fixed error when recording and failing to parse the git commit message. Fixes [#847](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/847) and [#841](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/841).\n*   Using a single space on: `cy.type(' ')` now works. Fixes [#807](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/807).\n*   `cy.spread()` can now be used on a collection of DOM elements. Fixes [#735](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/735).\n*   CLI shows help message when it is invoked with an unknown command like `$(npm bin)/cypress foo`. Fixes [#641](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/641).\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   Enable passing `CYPRESS_RECORD_KEY` without using the CLI by invoking the binary directly. Fixes [#820](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/820).\n*   Cypress binaries can now be pointed to a staging environment with `CYPRESS_ENV=staging`. Fixes [#813](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/813).\n*   The Test Runner displays the scrollbar correctly when the update banner is displayed. Fixes [#803](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/803).\n*   The branch name is now properly collected when recording in Buildkite CI. Fixes [#777](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/777).\n*   You can install the Cypress binary from any URL or file path using the [`CYPRESS_BINARY_VERSION` environment variable](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/advanced-installation). Closes [#701](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/701).\n\n**Documentation Changes:**\n\n*   [Created \"Conditional Testing\" core concept](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/conditional-testing)\n*   [Created \"Key Differences\" core concept](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/overview/key-differences)\n*   [Updated \"Best Practices\"](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/best-practices)\n*   [Updated \"FAQ Usage\"](https://docs.cypress.io/faq/questions/using-cypress-faq)\n\n## 1.0.2[​](#1-0-2 \"Direct link to 1.0.2\")\n\n_Released 10/13/2017_\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   `cy.type` now correctly fires change events on React 16. Fixes [#647](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/647).\n*   Fixed some problems serializing objects during domain change caused by circular references. In this case `zone.js` was the culprit. Fixes [#741](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/741).\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   `cy.scrollTo` now logs its coordinates when options are used. Fixes [#725](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/725).\n*   You can now use environment variables that have a `=` character as values. Fixes [#620](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/620).\n*   There is now a new `videoUploadOnPasses` configuration option in `cypress.json`. Turning this off will only compress and upload videos on failures. This only affects projects which are setup to record to the Dashboard. Fixes [#460](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/460).\n\n**Documentation Changes:**\n\n*   [Added examples for \"Catalog of Events\"](https://docs.cypress.io/api/cypress-api/catalog-of-events)\n*   \\[Added\\](/ Updated FAQ for \"Using Cypress\"' using-cypress-faq)\n\n## 1.0.1[​](#1-0-1 \"Direct link to 1.0.1\")\n\n_Released 10/10/2017_\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Prevent error during verification in the CLI on Linux / OSX. Also makes terminal colors work again. Fixes [#717](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/717) and [#718](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/718).\n\n## 1.0.0[​](#1-0-0 \"Direct link to 1.0.0\")\n\n_Released 10/09/2017_\n\n**Summary:**\n\n*   `1.0.0` marks our transition out of a **private** beta and into a **public** beta. We've lifted all the restrictions for using Cypress. It is now accessible to everyone. Until we are out of beta, the [Dashboard Service](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/cloud/introduction) will continue to be free.\n*   We will continue to follow `semver` from this point on (and also a bit more rigorously).\n*   Cypress is now [open source](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress)! This project is licensed under the terms of the [MIT License](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/blob/develop/LICENSE.md).\n*   We have a [Contributing Guideline](https://on.cypress.io/contributing) to help contributors get started as well as [issues labeled `first-timers-only`](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/labels/first-timers-only) for those wanting to contribute right away.\n*   You can now use the Test Runner application without logging in. Some areas of the application still require logging in through GitHub, like the 'Runs' tab and viewing the project's 'Record Key'. The only places where login is required is when it interacts with our external servers. Naturally these places are optional and will not affect the local test writing + running experience.\n*   We've removed the requirement of filling out an early adopter form and approval for logging in with GitHub to Cypress.\n*   [www.cypress.io](https://www.cypress.io/) has an all new design to help new visitors get started quickly and understand our future pricing more clearly.\n*   We are still updating the docs to reflect the `1.0.0` release.\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   Windows is now supported. We have been running it successfully on EC2 and all of our example projects are also running in CI with AppVeyor. It is still super beta (we're aware of a couple issues already) and we're still updating our own infrastructure to manage and test it as comprehensively as we do OSX and Linux. We are only building a 32bit version of Windows, but will soon be building a 64bit as well. As of today the Windows binary is about 2x the size of what it will be. Unzipping takes a long time, we are sorry. Fixes [#74](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/74) and [#444](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/444).\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   Added the `Beta` flag everywhere (since we are still technically in beta).\n*   Reduced the frequency the app checked for updates. Fixes [#713](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/713).\n*   The CLI now sends `arch` parameter to the download server so we can build and serve multiple binaries for Windows + Linux.\n\n**Documentation Changes:**\n\n*   [Updated \"Installing Cypress\"](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress)\n*   [Updated \"Writing your First Test\"](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/end-to-end-testing/writing-your-first-end-to-end-test)\n*   Added a 10 minute Getting Started video that [Andrew Van Slaars](https://github.com/avanslaars) created.\n\n## 0.20.3[​](#0-20-3 \"Direct link to 0.20.3\")\n\n_Released 10/06/2017_\n\n*   Improved verifying the binary for the first time after an `npm install`. Fixes [#709](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/709).\n\n## 0.20.2[​](#0-20-2 \"Direct link to 0.20.2\")\n\n_Released 10/06/2017_\n\n**Possibly Breaking Changes:**\n\n*   [cy.exec()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/exec) now trims output by default. That means if you were using an `eq` assertion the output will no longer have a trailing newline character `\\n`. It's unlikely you are doing this, but it is possible you may need to update your assertions to remove this character. Fixes [#697](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/697).\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Handle errors gracefully when Electron window has been closed before paint events happen. Fixes [#705](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/705).\n*   Basic auth now works _again_. Fixes [#573](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/573).\n*   [cy.exec()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/exec) now properly sources each time it is invoked instead of only once. Fixes [#694](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/694).\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   `cypress open` now accepts the `--project` flag which enables you to use a root level Cypress installation and point to multiple sub projects. Fixes [#661](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/661).\n*   Prevent newer versions of Chrome from prompting you to save passwords and suppressed other extension related popups for Windows. Fixes [#704](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/704).\n\n## 0.20.1[​](#0-20-1 \"Direct link to 0.20.1\")\n\n_Released 09/17/2017_\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   `cypress run` now supports a `--headed` option so the Electron browser will display instead of running headlessly. This matches what you can already do in the GUI. Fixes [#657](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/657).\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Using Cypress on nested projects now correctly works. Fixes [#635](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/635).\n*   Using `cy.type` on Angular 2 apps now works. We're now firing the `key` property when typing. We've properly mapped all the special keys too.\n*   `onBeforeLoad` now gets invoked when overriding `cy.visit`. Fixes [#656](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/656) and [#640](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/640).\n*   Using multiple `cy.visit` back to back which only change the `hash` now properly wait for the `hashchange` event to occur before moving on. Fixes [#652](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/652).\n*   CLI now displays the correct overridden `CYPRESS_BINARY_VERSION` on first open. Fixes [#659](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/659).\n*   Fixed the incorrectly spelled chainer `descendents`. It is now correctly spelled as `descendants`. Fixes [#642](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/642).\n*   The visibility algorithm has been considerably improved. Should fix most if not all visibility problems. We accounted for CSS transforms, translations, and added a new branch of logic for `position: fixed` elements which should be much more accurate. Fixes [#631](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/631).\n*   The CLI now treats `-h` and `--help` and `help` as valid commands. Fixes [#645](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/645).\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   You can now pass an object literal as `config` when using Cypress as a node module. Fixes [#639](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/639).\n*   Passing `--reporter` can now reference an absolute path instead of just relative. Fixes [#658](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/658).\n*   The algorithm that ensures an element is not covered now calculates this at the center coordinates instead of the top left. This should yield more accurate results, be closer to the default expectations of users, and bypass fractional pixel problems we were having. Fixes [#655](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/655).\n*   Improved crash reporting when the binary throws an uncaught error.\n\n**Documentation Changes:**\n\n*   [Updated \"Command Line\"](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line)\n*   [Updated \"Interacting with Elements\"](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/interacting-with-elements)\n\n## 0.20.0[​](#0-20-0 \"Direct link to 0.20.0\")\n\n_Released 09/10/2017_\n\n**Summary:**\n\n*   `0.20.0` is our biggest technical release ever. It accounts for more than 2,000 commits. It's full of breaking changes we wanted to land prior to having our public `1.0.0` release.\n*   You can now [install Cypress as a real `npm` module](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress), and even `require` it in your node files.\n*   We rewrote the entire driver (we've all been there) and converted all 2,500+ tests to be run within Cypress itself.\n\n**CLI Changes:**\n\n*   You now use `npm` to manage Cypress versions like every other dev dependency.\n*   Running `npm install --save-dev cypress` will automatically download the CLI + binary.\n*   There is no longer a separate `cypress install` step, but this command still exists if you want to **reinstall** the binary for whatever reason.\n*   No need to use `cypress-cli` anymore to manage Cypress versions. **You will need to uninstall the `cypress-cli` by running `npm uninstall -g cypress-cli`**.\n*   The [`cypress` module can be `required`](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/module-api) in your own node projects to programmatically control Cypress the same way you would from the command line.\n*   We've updated the installation experience to account for running locally and in CI so it doesn't generate a ton of logs in `stdout`.\n*   The `CYPRESS_VERSION` environment variable is gone because now the version of the binary is controlled by the npm module version. If for some reason you want to download the binary of a different version you can use the new `CYPRESS_BINARY_VERSION` environment variable - but you'll get a warning message when the versions don't match.\n*   If you install cypress globally using `npm install -g cypress` we will warn you that you should check this in as a `devDependency` but Cypress will continue to work in \"global mode\".\n*   Cypress now verifies it can run on your system prior to actually running. It'll do this for each new version the first time you try to use it. Errors it receives from attempting to run will bubble up nicely, so you'll get output for things like [missing linux dependencies](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/continuous-integration/introduction#Dependencies) instead of absolutely _nothing_ like before.\n*   We have better error handling and messaging around Xvfb failures.\n*   There is a new [`--browser` option](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-run) that lets you change the browser that runs from the command line. This works the same way as changing the browser in the GUI, with the exception that any browser other than the default `electron` browser will **not** record a video. This is solvable but requires more work.\n*   Whenever you encounter errors in the CLI we'll output helpful debugging information at the bottom of each error.\n*   You can use the new environment variable [`DEBUG=cypress:cli`](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line#Debugging-commands) to see debugging output from the CLI.\n\n**Breaking Changes:**\n\n*   We've removed the undocumented `cy.chain()` command. You should be able to safely remove this from your code. Fixes [#456](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/456).\n*   Updated [Cypress.\\_](https://docs.cypress.io/api/utilities/_) to use [lodash](https://lodash.com/) instead of [Underscore](http://underscorejs.org/). Fixes [#548](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/548).\n*   If any of an element's parent's overflow is 'hidden', we now calculate if the element is outside of the boundaries of that parent element and validate visibility assertions accordingly. This may cause some tests that were previously passing to now accurately fail. Fixes [#410](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/410).\n*   [`.select()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/select) should now look for the trimmed value inside of an `<option></option>`. This may change the content argument required to select the option you intended in your [`.select()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/select) command. Fixes [#175](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/175).\n*   When passing the option `{ force: true }` to [`.click()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/click) and [`.type()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/type), we no longer attempt to scroll the element into view. We've also disabled the check that the element is in view before clicking or typing. Fixes [#553](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/553) and [#537](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/537).\n*   `Cypress.Dom` has been renamed to `Cypress.dom`.\n*   `Cypress.Log.command` has been renamed to [Cypress.log](https://docs.cypress.io/api/cypress-api/cypress-log).\n*   [`chai-jQuery` assertions](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/assertions#Chai-jQuery) no longer change the subject when using `prop`, `attr`, and `css` with the **3rd** argument (which acts as equality check). Fixes [#605](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/605).\n*   We now throw when a value other than `cy` is returned from a test or command function. Fixes [#463](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/463).\n*   Returning a promise in a custom command while also invoking cy commands now throws. Fixes [#435](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/435).\n*   [cy.then()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/then) will now only pass its subject through when its callback function returns `undefined`. Previous it would pass the subject on `null` values as well.\n*   [cy.contains()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/contains) can no longer be chained on subjects which aren't `window`, `document` or `element`. This brings it into parity with the new custom command rules and makes it much less \"magical\". It enforces you to use it in a much clearer way when querying the entire document.\n*   Removed `Cypress.addParentCommand()`, `Cypress.addChildCommand()`, and `Cypress.addDualCommand()` in favor of the [new custom command interface](https://docs.cypress.io/api/cypress-api/custom-commands).\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   [`chai-jQuery` assertions](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/assertions#Chai-jQuery) have improved error messaging, and have had their internal double assertions removed, and can now be made on raw DOM objects. Fixes [#605](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/605).\n*   [`chai-jQuery` assertions](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/assertions#Chai-jQuery) now throw a nice error message when you're asserting on a non DOM object. Fixes [#604](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/604).\n*   New [.trigger()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/trigger) command. Useful for triggering arbitrary events. Fixes [#406](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/406).\n*   New [cy.scrollTo()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/scrollTo) command. Useful for having a container scroll to a specific position. Fixes [#497](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/497) & [#313](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/313).\n*   New [.scrollIntoView()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/scrollIntoView) command. Useful for scrolling an element into view. Fixes [#498](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/498) & [#313](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/313) & [#519](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/519).\n*   Input ranges are now more easily testable using the new [.trigger()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/trigger) command. See our [new recipe](https://docs.cypress.io/examples/recipes#Testing-the-DOM) for details on how. Fixes [#287](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/287).\n*   Testing drag and drop is now possible using the new [.trigger()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/trigger) command. See our [new recipe](https://docs.cypress.io/examples/recipes#Testing-the-DOM) for details on how. Fixes [#386](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/386).\n*   Updated [.click()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/click) command to accept more position arguments. Fixes [#499](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/499).\n*   Added support to [`.type()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/type) for inputs of type `date`, `time`, `month`, and `week`. Fixes [#27](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/27).\n*   You can now pass a browser option to [cypress run](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-run) as `--browser <browser name>`. This enables you to run the same set of browsers when running from the CLI as when you're running from the GUI. Fixes [#462](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/462) and [#531](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/531).\n*   [cypress open](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-open) no longer opens a detached process by default. Instead `cypress open` now accepts a new flag `--detached`, which replicates this behavior. Fixes [#531](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/531).\n*   We have all new [docker examples](https://docs.cypress.io/examples/docker) you can check out.\n*   The [`cypress` npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cypress) now checks the currently installed version on `install` and [run](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-run) and does not re-install Cypress if it is already installed. Fixes [#396](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/396).\n*   We've added a new [Cypress.Commands](https://docs.cypress.io/api/cypress-api/custom-commands) interface to handle adding your own custom commands. Fixes [#436](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/436).\n*   You can now overwrite existing commands with [Cypress.Commands.overwrite](https://docs.cypress.io/api/cypress-api/custom-commands).\n*   We removed an artificial delay that was being set in between commands. This means test commands now run faster.\n*   You can now [disable Cypress global exception handlers](https://docs.cypress.io/api/cypress-api/catalog-of-events) for your application. Fixes [#254](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/254)\n*   Uncaught errors appearing in your spec files or support files are now properly caught, have the right exit code, and display correctly. Fixes [#345](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/345)\n*   Cypress will now scroll past multiple elements that cover up an element to be interacted with. It also now factors in elements with `position: sticky`. Fixes [#571](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/571) and [#565](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/565).\n*   Cypress now scrolls all parent containers (not just `window`) when attempting to [check an element's actionability](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/interacting-with-elements#Actionability). Fixes [#569](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/569).\n*   Using Chai.js's `assert` interface now works correctly in your specs.\n*   Screenshots are now taken during each runnable that fails. Errors in tests will happen there. Errors in hooks will also happen there. Previously a screenshot would only happen after everything (including hooks) ran. Fixes [#394](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/394)\n*   [cy.screenshot()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/screenshot) now synchronizes its state with the reporter. This means you should see error messages (on the left side) on automatic screenshot errors.\n*   Using mocha's async `done` callback now works properly.\n*   You can now programmatically [intercept and potentially turn off uncaught application errors](https://docs.cypress.io/api/cypress-api/catalog-of-events) from failing your tests.\n*   You can now programmatically control whether you accept or cancel [window.confirm()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/cypress-api/catalog-of-events) calls from your application.\n\n**Dependencies:**\n\n*   Updated [Cypress.Promise](https://docs.cypress.io/api/utilities/promise) (which is Bluebird) from version `2.9.25` to `3.5.0`\n*   Updated [chai](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/bundled-libraries#Chai) from version `1.9.2` to `3.5.0`\n*   Updated [sinon](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/bundled-libraries#Sinonjs) from version `1.x` to `3.2.0`\n*   Updated [jQuery](https://docs.cypress.io/api/utilities/$) from version `2.1.4` to `2.2.4`.\n*   Removed [chai-jQuery](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/bundled-libraries#Chai-jQuery) and rewrote it from scratch.\n\n**Deprecations:**\n\n*   The [`cypress-cli` npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cypress-cli) has been deprecated. Fixes [#316](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/316).\n*   The interface for writing custom commands has been deprecated. [Please read our docs on the new custom commands interface](https://docs.cypress.io/api/cypress-api/custom-commands). Fixes [#436](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/436) and [#465](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/465).\n*   There are no more global, in-app updates. Versioning should be primarily [controlled via `npm`](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress) like every other package / dependency in your project. For users not using `npm` you can manually download new versions of Cypress when they're released.\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Fixed busted internal timers that caused random timeouts, proxy errors, incorrect delays, and long pauses when loading the GUI. Fixes [#572](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/572).\n*   `cy.route()` now matches requests opened with lowercase methods. Fixes [#607](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/607).\n*   Fixed regression where multiple uses of `cy.server()` in a `before` hook was throwing an error. Fixes [#80](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/80) and [#510](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/510) and [#595](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/595).\n*   When editing `cypress.json` file, the dead browser page no longer appears. Fixes [#492](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/492).\n*   [`.type()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/type) should now work on inputs regardless of capitalization of `type` attribute. Fixes [#550](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/550).\n*   Fixed issues where [`.type()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/type) was not appending text properly. Fixes [#503](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/503) and [#568](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/568).\n*   Fixed issue where [`.type()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/type) with `type=\"email\"` inputs were throwing an error. Fixes [#504](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/504).\n*   Fixed issue where using [`.type()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/type) on an input with a `type` defined in uppercase (`input type=\"TEXT\"`) would throw an error and not type. Fixes [#550](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/550).\n*   Fixed issue with [.clear()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/clear) and `type=\"number\"` inputs. Fixes [#490](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/490).\n*   Fixed issue where [`cy.exec()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/exec) was failing when running Cypress in docker. Fixes [#517](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/517).\n*   Cypress CLI no longer requires `git` to install. Fixes [#124](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/124)\n*   Improved the reporter's responsive design so controls still show at narrower widths. Fixes [#544](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/544).\n*   Commands text will no long cut off into ellipses when the Command Log is set to a wider width. Fixes [#528](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/528).\n*   Fixed issue where setting `fixturesFolder` to `false` would throw an error. Fixes [#450](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/450).\n*   Fixed issue where Cypress hanged due to Xvfb permissions. More intuitive output is given during install failures. Fixes [#330](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/330).\n*   [The checks used to determine an element's actionability](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/interacting-with-elements#Actionability) are now run synchronously. This solves some circumstances where the element could have moved or otherwise change between the checks. Fixes [#570](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/570).\n*   Fixed issue where clipped elements with `overflow-y: hidden` were falsely passing as \"visible\". Fixes [#563](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/563).\n*   When using [`.select()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/select) on a select with multiple options with the same value, we now properly set `selectedIndex` and `selectedOptions` on the `select`. Fixes [#554](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/554).\n*   Fixed issue where changing any spec file (renaming, adding, deleting) would remove the highlighted styling of the currently active spec file in the Test Runner. Fixes [#547](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/547).\n*   We now get the absolute paths of styles to use when displaying snapshots. This will fix situations where some stylesheets were improperly referenced during the snapshot, so did not display styles correctly. Fixes [#525](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/525).\n*   Fixed issue where commands would retry and potentially exceed their timeout values during page transitions. Fixes [#594](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/594)\n*   Fixed issue where server routes were lost after page load if not initiated by a [`cy.visit()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/visit) command. Fixes [#177](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/177)\n*   Using mocha's `done` callback now works correctly. We've improved mocha's handling of uncaught exceptions and properly associate them to test failures.\n*   [cy.viewport()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/viewport) is now synchronized with the UI so that it does not resolve until the DOM has re-rendered using the dimensions.\n*   \"outer assertions\" now are correctly retried by previous commands. Fixes [#543](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/543).\n*   The example\\_spec from the [kitchen-sink](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-example-kitchensink) will never accidentally be seeded when running [cypress run](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-run) on a brand new project.\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   We now display a warning in the console when returning a promise from a test and also invoking a Promise or cy commands. Fixes [#464](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/464).\n*   Reduced the number of internal Cypress network requests in the \"Network Panel\" of Dev Tools. Fixes [#606](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/606).\n*   We've moved our entire codebase into one into a private \"Monorepo\". This is in anticipation for going open source (making the GitHub repo public) and should make it easier for everyone to contribute to our code. Fixes [#256](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/256).\n*   When element's are not visible due to being covered by another element, the error message now says what element is covering what element. [#611](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/611)\n*   Improved the calculations to calculate an elements visibility. Additionally updated error messages to be clearer whenever an element isn't considered visible. Fixes [#613](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/613)\n*   The \"Can't start server\" error displayed in the Desktop-GUI no longer prevents you from interacting in the Desktop App. It now displays as a warning. Fixes [#407](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/407).\n*   [`cy.focused()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/focused) now automatically retries until the element exists in the DOM. This makes it behave the same as [cy.get()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/get) Fixes [#564](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/564) and [#409](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/409).\n*   We now support per-project `state.json`. Fixes [#512](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/512).\n*   We can now handle multiple projects per server. Fixes [#512](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/512).\n*   The Test Runner can now have projects added by being 'dragged' in. Fixes .\n*   The Test Runner update window now has messaging about `package.json` versioning. Fixes [#513](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/513).\n*   The Test Runner now accounts for cypress being installed per project as npm module. Fixes [#500](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/500) and [#514](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/514).\n*   [cypress install](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line) `-d` option. Fixes [#389](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/389).\n*   Exposing Cypress Binary should no longer be necessary when cypress is locally installed. Fixes [#379](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/379).\n*   Added an 'App Data' option in the Desktop App that displays app data. Fixes [#475](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/475).\n*   When [`cy.spy()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/spy) or [`cy.stub()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/stub) are never called, the error now displays a clearer, grammatically correct error. Fixes [#520](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/520).\n*   Detection of installed browsers has been improved. Fixes [#511](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/511).\n*   When commands are clicked on and logged into the console from the Command Log, they now display their 'yield' instead of 'return', since they really yield instead of return. [#612](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/612)\n*   The build process of the driver has been modernized. Fixes [#429](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/429).\n*   XHR's from your application are no longer forcefully aborted between tests.\n*   Better error handling when running commands outside of a test.\n*   URL changes from navigation events or hashchanges now display more accurately.\n*   [cy.go()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/go) now snapshots before and after the navigation event.\n*   Page load events no longer forcibly `null` out the current subject. This was very unexpected and difficult to debug. Now stale elements or other objects from previous pages are yielded to you.\n*   Using an array of the same alias in a [cy.wait()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/wait) now yields you those XHR's in the order they were requested. Previously it was based on when the responses were returned.\n*   Returning `null` from a [.then()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/then) will now change the subject to that. Previously returning `null` would not cause subject changes.\n*   We now no longer remove spies, stubs, or routes at the end of the very last test. This enables you to continue to manually use your app and have Cypress continue to instrument it.\n*   Updated a few things to more aggressively cause GC.\n*   Onboarding dialogs will never show up again once they are dismissed. Fixes [#522](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/522).\n*   `window.alert()` and `window.confirm()` now generate a page event in the Command Log (including the message).\n*   [`cy.spy()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/spy) and [`cy.stub()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/stub) now have a `.log(bool)` method to disable their calls from generating a Command Log. Useful when your spies or stubs are called an excessive number of times.\n*   Improved command subject validation error messages.\n*   Improved the element detachment error messages (when you try to interact with an element that's become stale / detached from the document).\n*   We finally have _partial_ iframe support. You can at least now [cy.wrap()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/wrap) iframe elements and interact with them using Cypress commands. More work needs to be done to \"switch into\" and back \"out of\" iframes. But we're getting there.\n*   Scaffolding new projects no longer generates a `default.js` file.\n*   Scaffolded `index.js` and `commands.js` have had their content updated to point to the custom commands API.\n*   You can now call [.focus()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/focus) and [.blur()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/blur) on [cy.window()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/window).\n*   The `CYPRESS_DEBUG` env option has been removed in favor of the `debug` module and [`DEBUG=cypress:*`](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line#Debugging-commands) usage.\n*   Attempting to run [cypress run](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-run) on a project without a `cypress.json` now errors instead of scaffolding and running the kitchen sink.\n\n**Documentation Changes:**\n\nNote: we are still updating all of the docs to reflect all the 0.20.0 changes.\n\n*   [New \"Catalog of Events\"](https://docs.cypress.io/api/cypress-api/catalog-of-events)\n*   [New \"Cypress.Commands\"](https://docs.cypress.io/api/cypress-api/custom-commands)\n*   [New \"Cypress.log\"](https://docs.cypress.io/api/cypress-api/cypress-log)\n*   [New \".trigger()\"](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/trigger)\n*   [New \"cy.scrollTo()\"](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/scrollTo)\n*   [New \".scrollIntoView()\"](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/scrollIntoView)\n*   [Updated \"Installing Cypress\"](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress)\n*   [Updated \"Writing Your First Test\"](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/end-to-end-testing/writing-your-first-end-to-end-test)\n*   [Updated \"Testing Your App\"](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/end-to-end-testing/testing-your-app)\n*   [Updated \"Command Line\"](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line)\n*   [Updated \"Debugging\"](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/debugging)\n*   [Updated \"Assertions\"](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/assertions)\n*   [Updated \"Interacting with Elements\"](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/interacting-with-elements)\n\n## 0.19.4[​](#0-19-4 \"Direct link to 0.19.4\")\n\n_Released 06/18/2017_\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\nFixed [.type()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/type) not firing `input` event for [React](https://reactjs.org/) on versions 15.6.x. Fixes [#536](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/536).\n\n## 0.19.3[​](#0-19-3 \"Direct link to 0.19.3\")\n\n_Released 06/14/2017_\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Server's that send `Content-Encoding: br` no longer cause Cypress to fail due to incorrect decoding. Cypress now strips encodings it cannot accept. Fixes [#535](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/535).\n\n## 0.19.2[​](#0-19-2 \"Direct link to 0.19.2\")\n\n_Released 04/16/2017_\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   You can now run your tests in the [Electron browser](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/launching-browsers#Electron-Browser) that comes built with Cypress. You will see it as an option in the browser dropdown. This is the same browser that Cypress uses when running `cypress run`. This is useful for debugging issues that only occur during headless runs. Addresses [#452](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/452).\n*   New traversal commands [`.nextAll()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/nextall), [`.nextUntil()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/nextuntil), [`.parentsUntil()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/parentsuntil), [`.prevAll()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/prevall), and [`.prevUntil()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/prevuntil) have been added. Addresses [#432](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/432).\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   An error is now thrown if an `undefined` value is mistakenly passed into [`cy.wait()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/wait). Previously, it would set the command timeout to an unimaginably large number of ms. Fixes [#332](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/332)\n*   Fixed issue where the contents of `state.json` were emptied, which would cause a crash and loss of state information. Fixes [#473](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/473) and [#474](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/474).\n*   We no longer write the chrome extension within `node_modules`, and instead write this to the proper OS specific `appData` folder. Fixes [#245](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/245) and [#290](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/290).\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   Error handling for invalid arguments passed to [`cy.wait()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/wait) have been improved and will now suggest valid arguments that are acceptable.\n*   Browsers in the browser dropdown now have colored icons, which help visually distinguish the variants of Chrome.\n*   Increased timeout for browser to make a connection when running during `cypress run` from 10 seconds to 30 seconds.\n*   Internally refactored how browsers are added and spawned in preparation of us adding cross browser support.\n*   Switching specs in the GUI now closes the browser and respawns it and refocuses it.\n\n## 0.19.1[​](#0-19-1 \"Direct link to 0.19.1\")\n\n_Released 03/09/2017_\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   Added `Cypress.version` property. Fixes [#404](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/404).\n*   Selecting `<option>` inside `<optgroup>` now works with [`.select()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/select). Fixes [#367](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/367).\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   `EMFILE` errors have been fixed. These were being caused due to `ulimit` being too low on your OS. This should fix the file watching problems people were having. Essentially we just replaced `fs` with `graceful-fs` and crossed our fingers this works. (It did on our machines). Fixes [#369](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/369).\n*   Now you can select the error text in the GUI. Fixes [#344](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/344).\n*   Cypress now correctly re-bundles files even when `watchForFileChanges` is set to `false`. Fixes [#446](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/446) and [#347](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/347).\n*   Fixed file watching when changing the `integrationFolder` to something other than the default value. Fixes [#438](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/438).\n*   [`.select()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/select) now works on options that have the same value. Fixes [#441](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/441).\n*   Cypress no longer crashes when you click links in the on-boarding screen called \"To help you get started...\". Fixes [#227](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/227).\n*   The `example_spec.js` file that gets seeded on a new project no longer fails on [`cy.readFile()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/readfile). Fixes [#414](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/414).\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   We now preserve the Test Runner's position and sizing after it's closed + reopened. Fixes [#443](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/443).\n*   We now ignore watching `node_modules`, `bower_components` and a few other folders to reduce the number of watched files. Fixes [#437](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/437).\n\n## 0.19.0[​](#0-19-0 \"Direct link to 0.19.0\")\n\n_Released 02/11/2017_\n\n**Notes:**\n\n*   We have updated all of the docs related to these changes. The [CI Docs](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/continuous-integration/introduction) got a much needed facelift.\n*   There is a new docs section related to the [Dashboard](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/cloud/introduction) and the new features.\n\n**Overview:**\n\n*   We have officially released our [Dashboard](https://on.cypress.io/dashboard) which is our service that will display recorded runs.\n*   This service has now been fully integrated into the Desktop Application. There is a new on-boarding process that helps you setup projects for recording.\n\n**Breaking Changes:**\n\n*   We have done our very best to create as little breaking changes as possible.\n*   You will need to download a new [cypress-cli](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line) - version `0.13.1`.\n*   Older CLI versions will continue to work on `0.19.0` except for the [cypress open](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-open) command - and will we print a warning to nudge you to upgrade.\n*   Newer CLI versions will not work on versions of Cypress < `0.19.0` (but we don't know why this would ever even happen).\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   There is a new [Dashboard](https://on.cypress.io/dashboard) service that displays your recorded runs.\n*   The [Dashboard](https://on.cypress.io/dashboard) enables you to view your recorded runs, manage projects, create organizations, invite users and set permissions.\n*   Projects are either **public** with their runs being publicly viewable by anyone, or **private** which restricts their access to only users you've invited. All **existing** projects were set to **private** by default.\n*   When you invite users (from the Dashboard) we will **automatically** allow them. This means you can invite all of your teammates (or anyone else). They can start using Cypress without talking to us.\n*   We now list all of the recorded runs directly in the Test Runner under a new `Runs` tab. Fixes [#236](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/236).\n*   Your list of projects in the Test Runner now displays their last recorded run status - passing, failing, pending, running, etc.\n*   We've changed the \"Config\" tab to now be called \"Settings\". We added two new sections to the \"Settings\" tab which displays your `projectId` and your Record Key. These sections do a much better job explaining what these are and how you use them.\n*   You no longer have to use `cypress get:key` to get your Record Key. We now display this in your \"Settings\" tab and also in the [Dashboard](https://on.cypress.io/dashboard).\n*   Projects will no longer automatically acquire a `projectId` when being added. There is now a very explicit **opt-in** process where you setup your project to record. This should make it much clearer what's going on behind the scenes.\n*   [cypress run](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-run) now behaves likes `cypress ci` previously did and downloads + installs Cypress if it's not already installed.\n*   `cypress ci` now works in OSX, and also works in Linux in Desktop flavors (like Ubuntu).\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   [cypress run](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-run) will now download and install Cypress if it is not already installed.\n*   We renamed `CYPRESS_CI_KEY` TO `CYPRESS_RECORD_KEY`. This makes it clearer what this key actually does - and the fact that it can be run anywhere irrespective of CI. We still look for the old named key but will print a warning if we detect it.\n*   We print a warning when using an older CLI tool version. Fixes [#424](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/424).\n*   We've improved many of the error messages related to recording runs. Fixes [#423](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/423).\n*   `cypress ci` has been deprecated. You now use [`cypress run --record --key <record_key>`](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-run). The key you used to pass to `cypress ci` is the same key. We've consolidated these commands into just [cypress run](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-run) which makes it simpler and clearer. Their only difference is that passing `--record` to [cypress run](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-run) will **record** the build to our Dashboard. Fixes [#417](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/417).\n\n## 0.18.8[​](#0-18-8 \"Direct link to 0.18.8\")\n\n_Released 02/05/2017_\n\n**Overview:**\n\n*   We have officially implemented our [Sinon.JS](http://sinonjs.org/) integration: adding [`cy.stub()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/stub), [`cy.spy()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/spy), [`cy.clock()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/clock), and [`cy.tick()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/tick). We've matched Sinon's APIs and added `sinon-as-promised` and `chai-sinon`. In addition we've fixed Sinon performance issues, and improved the display of assertion passes and failures.\n*   These new APIs will work well in both `unit` tests and `integration` tests.\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   You can now use [`cy.stub()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/stub) and [`cy.spy()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/spy) synchronously. These both match the Sinon API identically. We will display `stub/spy` calls in the Command Log and provide the call count, arguments, context, and return values when you click on the log. Stubs are automatically reset between tests. Fixes [#377](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/377).\n*   We've added our own special aliasing flavor to [`cy.stub()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/stub) and [`cy.spy()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/spy). You can use the [`.as()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/as) command and we will associate spy and stub invocations (the same way we do with XHR aliasing and route matching).\n*   We've added [`cy.clock()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/clock) and [`cy.tick()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/tick) which are both asynchronous methods to modify timers in your application under test. We automatically apply clock (even if you invoke it before your first [`cy.visit()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/visit)) and will automatically reapply it after page load. [`cy.tick()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/tick) will enable you to control the amount of time you want passed in your application. This is great for controlling _throttled_ or _debounced_ functions.\n*   `sinon-as-promised` is automatically applied under the hood which extends Sinon and provides the `.resolves(...)` and `.rejects(...)` APIs which makes it easy to stub promise returning functions.\n*   We support and display multiple sub spies when using Sinon's `.withArgs(...)` function.\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   We've enhanced `chai-sinon` by improving the output during passes or failures. Fixes [#31](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/31).\n*   We've ripped out Sinon's argument serialization in favor of our own.\n*   We no longer send Sinon to the remote application under test. In other words, you'll no longer see `sinon.js` being sent as a network request.\n*   Deprecated the undocumented `cy.agents` function, but it will continue to work and will be officially removed later.\n\n## 0.18.7[​](#0-18-7 \"Direct link to 0.18.7\")\n\n_Released 01/30/2017_\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Fixed regression in `0.18.6` that caused Cypress to fail when switching spec files when `baseUrl` was set in `cypress.json`. Fixes [#403](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/403).\n\n## 0.18.6[​](#0-18-6 \"Direct link to 0.18.6\")\n\n_Released 01/29/2017_\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   We now launch Cypress tests directly to the `baseUrl` to avoid an initial page refresh when encountering the first [`cy.visit()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/visit) command. This should help tests run faster. Fixes [#382](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/382).\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Uninstalling the last used browser no longer causes the Test Runner to error and hang. Fixes [#371](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/371).\n*   Fixed issue where `stdout` would not be displayed on a completed `cypress ci` run. Fixes [#398](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/398).\n*   Fixed a longstanding issue in Cypress where logging in from another computer would kill the session on all other computers, and prevent you from accessing `cypress get:key` (amongst other things). Fixes [#400](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/400).\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   We now validate all of the configuration options set in `cypress.json` to ensure it has valid types. Fixes [#399](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/399).\n*   We now validate that `baseUrl` is accessible **prior** to running tests. This prevents a common situation where you may forget to boot your web server and have instantly failing tests. Fixes [#383](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/383).\n*   We now show the entire scaffolded tree of files when adding a brand new project. Fixes [#401](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/401).\n*   We display errors coming from `babel` with more helpful information now.\n*   Changed the [Test Runner](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/tree/develop/packages/desktop-gui) to use `JWT` for authorization. **You will have to log in again**.\n\n## 0.18.5[​](#0-18-5 \"Direct link to 0.18.5\")\n\n_Released 01/08/2017_\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   You can now disable `videoCompression` by passing `false` in `cypress.json` or env variables. In very long runs and on CPU throttled instances compression can take a considerable amount of time, possibly as much as 50% of the time spent running actual tests. Fixes [#372](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/372).\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   Improved performance when running `cypress run` by caching the last bundled spec. This prevents having the same spec file rebundled each time [`cy.visit()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/visit) caused a full page navigation. You should see a moderate improvement in test run time. Fixes [#370](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/370).\n*   We are now capturing `stdout` and several other properties for use + display in our Dashboard on `cypress ci` runs.\n*   Enable [`cy.fixture()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/fixture) to send an encoding for images other than forcing the default encoding of `base64`. Fixes [#373](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/373).\n*   Enable `cy.route()` to pass an `encoding` parameter when using `fx:fixture` syntax. Fixes [#374](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/374).\n\n## 0.18.4[​](#0-18-4 \"Direct link to 0.18.4\")\n\n_Released 12/28/2016_\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Prevent [`cy.url()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/url) from accessing the URL during transition phase and throwing an error. Fixes [#356](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/356).\n*   Stubbed functions now serialize correctly when switching domains on a [`cy.visit()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/visit). Fixes [#354](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/354).\n*   Fixed a handful of scenarios and edge cases where cookies were not properly synchronized between external requests and the browser. This led to situations where cookies were either duplicated on requests, or were not sent. Fixes [#357](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/357) and [#361](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/361) and [#362](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/362).\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   [`cy.request()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/request) now favors `baseUrl` config over remote origin when you do not pass a fully qualified URL. Fixes [#360](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/360).\n\n## 0.18.3[​](#0-18-3 \"Direct link to 0.18.3\")\n\n_Released 12/18/2016_\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   There is now a [`cy.log()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/log) command for displaying an arbitrary message and args. Useful for providing context while testing and debugging long tests. Fixes [#342](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/342).\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   [`cy.title()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/title) now uses the `document.title` property as opposed to querying for `<title>` elements in the `<head>`. Fixes [#351](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/351) and [#331](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/331).\n*   We now exit correctly (with status of 1) in the case of headless renderer crashes. Additionally we capture these errors properly, explain what happened, and link to external error document to suggest fixes. Fixes [#270](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/270) and [#348](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/348).\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   Improved headless performance, and added optimizations for early and often GC.\n\n## 0.18.2[​](#0-18-2 \"Direct link to 0.18.2\")\n\n_Released 12/15/2016_\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Under the hood [`cy.visit()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/visit) now sets an `Accept: text/html,*/*` request header to prevent some web servers from sending back `404` in the case where they required this header. Only a small % of servers would ever do this, but `webpack-dev-server` was one of them. Fixes [#309](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/309).\n*   [`cy.request()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/request) now sends an `Accept: */*` request header by default too. Fixes [#338](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/338).\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   [`cy.request()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/request) now includes more debugging information (related to headers) in the error output. Fixes [#341](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/341).\n*   When [`cy.request()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/request) times out, we now output much better error messages including information about the request sent. Fixes [#340](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/340).\n\n## 0.18.1[​](#0-18-1 \"Direct link to 0.18.1\")\n\n_Released 12/11/2016_\n\n**Notes:**\n\n*   There is a new [recipe showcasing these new features](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-example-recipes).\n*   We are adding several other recipes to show examples of all the ways you can use [`cy.request()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/request) to improve your tests.\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   [`cy.request()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/request) can now have its automatic redirect following turned off by passing `{followRedirect: false}`. Fixes [#308](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/308).\n*   [`cy.request()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/request) now has a `qs` option that automatically appends query params to the `url` property. Fixes [#321](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/321).\n*   [`cy.request()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/request) now follows redirects exactly like a real browser. Previously if you `POST`ed to an endpoint and it redirected to a `GET` then [`cy.request()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/request) would not follow it due to the `method` changing. It now follows method changing redirects by default. Fixes [#322](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/322).\n*   [`cy.request()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/request) now accepts the `form` option which will convert the `body` values to urlencoded content and automatically set the `x-www-form-urlencoded` header. This means you can now use [`cy.request()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/request) to bypass your UI and login with standard form values. Fixes [#319](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/319).\n*   When [`cy.request()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/request) fails, it now outputs the full request / response information. This behaves more similar to [`cy.visit()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/visit) failures. Fixes [#324](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/324).\n*   [`cy.request()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/request) now prints **all** of the underlying HTTP request / response information into the Dev Tools' console (when clicking on the Command Log). This means that you will see everything you would normally see from the `Network` tab as if the request were made from the browser. We even print redirect information. Fixes [#325](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/325).\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Cypress' internal `babel` will no longer attempt to load your project's `.babelrc`. This helps avoid potential version conflicts. Fixes [#312](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/312).\n*   We no longer watch the `supportFile` while running `cypress run`. Fixes [#329](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/329).\n*   `watchForFileChanges` is now correctly respected in regards to watching all files, including the `supportFile`. Fixes [#336](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/336).\n*   There is no longer an error when scaffolding a new Cypress project. Fixes [#326](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/326).\n*   The Runner UI no longer appears to be \"running\" when there is a spec bundle error in the `supportFile`.\n*   Cypress now correctly exits during `cypress run` in `linux` when the browser fails to connect. Fixes [#333](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/333).\n*   Cypress now correctly exits during `cypress run` in `linux` when there is a spec bundle error. Fixes [#337](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/337).\n*   Cypress now retries up to 3 times for the browser to connect during `cypress run`. The warning / error messages were also updated to be clearer. Partially addresses [#334](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/334).\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   Deprecated `failOnStatus` property for [`cy.request()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/request) and renamed to `failOnStatusCode`. Fixes [#323](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/323).\n*   Removed the `cookies` option from [`cy.request()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/request) because cookies are now _always_ get/set on requests. This option really never made any sense to have. Fixes [#320](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/320).\n*   Better data reporting when recording builds in CI.\n*   We now collect \"global\" errors that may prevent any tests from running. We will be displaying these in our future CI platform.\n\n## 0.18.0[​](#0-18-0 \"Direct link to 0.18.0\")\n\n_Released 11/27/2016_\n\n**Notes:**\n\n*   We've created a new [example recipes repo](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-example-recipes) to show you common testing scenarios including how to use the new module support.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n*   We've added automatic ES2015+, module, JSX, and CJSX support to all test files. This means you can use `require`, `import`, or `export` declarations to load other files. You can also use this to import your own application specific JavaScript modules and write unit tests for them. More of these details are yet to come. [See this issue](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/318).\n*   You can now use your regularly installed `node_modules` in your project to do things like utilizing [`lodash`](https://lodash.com/) for utility functions or extending [`chai`](http://www.chaijs.com/) with assertion plugins.\n*   Because we're now processing the spec files prior to handing them off to the browser, this means we will display problems like syntax errors when something in the processing goes wrong. Additionally, we print these out during `cypress run`, so you're not stuck wondering what went wrong.\n\n**Breaking Changes:**\n\n*   Previously, we auto-magically included all files within [`cypress/support`](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/legacy-configuration#Folders--Files). This has now [gone away](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/error-messages#Support-file-missing-or-invalid) and we've simplified this to automatically including a single `cypress/support/index.js` file. That single file acts as the entry point meaning you should `import` or `require` the other support files you'd like to include. Although this is still \"automatic\" it's much less magical and we'll be updating all of our docs to reflect this. The purpose of `cypress/support` hasn't really changed, just the implementation of it has. We will automatically seed a `cypress/support/index.js` file for you (even on existing projects). The file location of `cypress/support/index.js` can be changed with the new [`supportFile`](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/legacy-configuration#Folders--Files) option in your `cypress.json`. This feature can also be turned off by specifying `supportFile: false`.\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   We now support ES2015+, modules, and JSX in all spec files. Fixes [#246](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/246).\n*   Spec files may now be written as `.js`, `.jsx`, `.coffee`, or `cjsx` files.\n*   Test files with JS syntax errors are now [handled](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/error-messages) and we provide a GUI that points to the exact line/column number. Additionally we print these out during `cypress run` and exit the process with `code 1`. Fixes [#293](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/293).\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   We improved the logic around when and if we scaffold files on a new project. We're much smarter about this and not generating these forcibly every time. Fixes [#285](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/285).\n*   Simplified handling of support files and made them less \"magical\". Fixes [#286](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/286).\n*   Renamed `supportFolder` to [`supportFile`](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration#Testing-Type-Specific-Options) in `cypress.json`. We will automatically rename your `cypress.json` if this property was present on update.\n\n## 0.17.12[​](#0-17-12 \"Direct link to 0.17.12\")\n\n_Released 11/21/2016_\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   You no longer have to log in again after updating. Fixes [#305](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/305).\n*   Updating in app now works again. Sorry about that. Fixes [#304](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/304).\n*   Headless frame rate is now correctly set to `20` instead of resetting back to `60`. Fixes [#303](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/303).\n*   We now automatically drop frames that the CPU cannot keep up with while video recording during `cypress run`. Previously we would buffer all frames in memory and it was possible to exhaust all memory due to the way that streaming backpressure works. Fixes [#302](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/302).\n*   Fixed an edge case in the `driver` that could lead to memory leaks. This happened when Command Logs updated from previously run tests. Normally, in headless mode, we automatically remove references to purge memory after each test, but when logs were updated after this, their references were merged back in again and held onto forever. If you were seeing long Cypress runs die or eventually halt, this was likely the cause. We did extensive memory regression analysis on Cypress and could not find any more memory leaks. Fixes [#301](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/301).\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   Improved [cypress run](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-run) and `cypress ci` headless output. Fixes [#306](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/306).\n*   Improved performance by preventing `snapshots` from being taken during headless runs.\n\n## 0.17.11[​](#0-17-11 \"Direct link to 0.17.11\")\n\n_Released 11/16/2016_\n\n**Roadmap:**\n\n*   The changes in version `0.17.11` below are in preparation for Cypress platform service: a portal where screenshots, videos, config, and logs of your builds are accessible.\n\n**Overview:**\n\n*   `cypress ci` now uploads build assets to our servers after a test run completes. Additionally, it tracks the `config` settings used during the build and tracks each individual test failure.\n*   If you do _not_ want these assets to be tracked by Cypress, you need to switch to using [cypress run](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-run). We will happily remove any build assets that are accidentally uploaded to us during the update transition.\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   We now record videos during a headless run with both `cypress ci` and [cypress run](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-run). Fixes [#229](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/229).\n*   After completing `cypress ci`, we now upload build assets (such as `screenshots` and `videos`) to be used in our upcoming admin interface. This will enable you to review assets without having to touch your CI server. Fixes [#292](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/292).\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   We've redesigned the headless run `stdout` to give you more details of the run, the stats after the run, what screenshots were taken, the video that was recorded, compression settings for the video, uploading asset progress, etc.\n*   Screenshot names now include their parent titles, and invalid file system characters are scrubbed. Fixes [#297](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/297).\n*   We no longer artificially restrict the environment `cypress ci` can run in. It can now run _anywhere_. Fixes [#296](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/296).\n*   We removed scaffolding any directories on a new project (during `cypress run`). Fixes [#295](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/295).\n*   [cypress run](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-run) no longer prompts the user for any kind of interaction, thus enabling you to use this in CI if you choose to do so. Fixes [#294](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/294).\n*   There is a new [configuration](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration) property called: `trashAssetsBeforeHeadlessRuns` (This was changed to `trashAssetsBeforeRuns` in [`3.0.0`](#3-0-0)) that is set to `true` by default and will automatically clear out screenshots + videos folders before each run. These files are not deleted, they are just moved to your trash.\n*   There are several new [configuration](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration) properties for video recording: `videoRecording`, `videoCompression`, and `videosFolder`.\n\n## 0.17.10[​](#0-17-10 \"Direct link to 0.17.10\")\n\n_Released 11/07/2016_\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Fixed switching between two different spec files from the desktop app causing `document.domain` to be wrong. Fixes [#276](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/276).\n*   Fixed inserting the string `null` into [`cy.request()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/request) urls when providing a `baseUrl` in `cypress.json` while origin could not be determined. Fixes [#274](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/274).\n*   Fixed incorrect error message on reverse visibility assertions. Fixes [#275](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/275).\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   We've improved the way we inject content into `<html>` responses by filtering the underlying HTTP request headers. We no longer inject content into templates which were loaded via XHR. Fixes [#257](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/257) and [#288](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/288).\n\n## 0.17.9[​](#0-17-9 \"Direct link to 0.17.9\")\n\n_Released 10/22/2016_\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Cypress now applies cookies to the browser which were cleared between redirects. Fixes [#224](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/224).\n*   Snapshots now work even when `<html>` tag has invalid attributes. Fixes [#271](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/271).\n*   Cypress no longer crashes on initial [`cy.visit()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/visit) when the 3rd party web server never ends the response. Fixes [#272](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/272).\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   Changed default [`responseTimeout`](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration#Timeouts) from `20000` to `30000`.\n*   Changed default [`pageLoadTimeout`](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration#Timeouts) from `30000` to `60000`.\n*   The internal Cypress proxy now forcibly responds to requests taking longer than `responseTimeout`. Currently this sends back `text/html` with the `ETIMEDOUT` error, but this likely needs to be configurable. The reason we are now forcibly applying timeouts is to prevent `socket pooling exhaustion` where tests are running and a 3rd party server never responds to the request.\n\n## 0.17.8[​](#0-17-8 \"Direct link to 0.17.8\")\n\n_Released 10/13/2016_\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Fixed `opener of undefined` errors due to `page load` events causing snapshots prior to the `load` event of the remote application. Thanks to everyone who helped pitched in on this one! Fixes [#258](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/258).\n*   Cypress now correctly sets cookies with `expirationDate` in the past. Chrome did not handle these cookies as documented and our code did not take this into account. We also added a lot more `e2e` tests around this behavior. Fixes [#266](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/266).\n*   We are now taking additional precautions to prevent Cypress from trashing the wrong folder during an upgrade (with an open project). This was actually fixed in `0.17.7` but the problem was is that during an update, the new version (which was fixed) was still being passed the wrong arguments from the older (broken) application. We've now upgraded `0.17.8` to detect this, and just use the expected default install location of Cypress. If you're concerned, just _close_ your currently open project before updating. Fixes [#265](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/265).\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   When an in app update fails in `linux` we now provide instructions on how to manually update Cypress.\n*   We now properly take the `maxAge` cookie flag into account and give it preference over the `expires` flag as per the cookie spec.\n\n## 0.17.7[​](#0-17-7 \"Direct link to 0.17.7\")\n\n_Released 10/12/2016_\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   There is now a new [`chromeWebSecurity`](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration#Browser) option you can set in `cypress.json` to turn off Chrome's Web Security features. We've written a brand new reference that details why and how you could use this. [Cypress Web Security](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/web-security). This option can be used for accessing `cross origin` `<iframes>` or if your application needs to test navigation across super domains. Fixes [#262](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/262).\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   We now capture `cross origin` errors correctly instead of these showing as `Uncaught DOMExceptions` in the console. Fixes [#261](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/261).\n*   We no longer trash the wrong folder on OSX in-app updates (when a project is open). Sorry about this! Fixes [#260](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/260).\n*   [`cy.visit()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/visit) urls with domain-like segments (which weren't actually the domain) no longer cause Cypress to think you're trying to navigate to a different superdomain. Fixes [#255](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/255).\n\n## 0.17.6[​](#0-17-6 \"Direct link to 0.17.6\")\n\n_Released 10/04/2016_\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   Snapshots will now be _pinned_ when clicking on a command in the Command Log. This enables you to inspect the state of the DOM when the snapshot was taken. We've given you a new series of controls for turning off the element highlighting and hitboxes. Additionally we've given you the ability to manually click through each named snapshot when there are multiple states (like before and after). Fixes [#247](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/247).\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Fixed a regression where tests that failed outside of a hook would incorrectly indicate themselves as a `before each` hook. In addition, in the default `spec`, reporter will now display the test name when a hook was the source of failure. Fixes [#253](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/253).\n*   Fixed a deployment bug in the `core-desktop-gui`.\n*   We now prevent [`cy.visit()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/visit) from accidentally snapshotting twice.\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   [`cy.request()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/request) and [`cy.visit()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/visit) now correctly send `User-Agent` headers based on the current open browsing session. Fixes [#230](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/230).\n\n## 0.17.5[​](#0-17-5 \"Direct link to 0.17.5\")\n\n_Released 10/02/2016_\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   We've added `JUnit` as a valid [built-in reporters](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/tooling/reporters). Fixes [#178](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/178).\n*   You can now [add or write your own custom reporters](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/tooling/reporters). This means you can `npm install xyz-mocha-reporter` and we'll automatically correctly `require` that package. Alternatively you can write your own `xyz-custom_reporter.js` file. Fixes [#231](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/231).\n*   The `reporter` can now be resized. We persist this state locally so it should \"stick\" between browser launches / app restarts. Fixes [#204](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/204).\n*   Cypress now \"remembers\" the last browser you had open and will suggest opening that whenever a project is opened. Addresses [#193](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/193).\n*   Instead of seeing `Script error.` - cross origins script errors are now handled specially and we throw a very long and exciting error explaining what just happened. Fixes [#241](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/241).\n*   When uncaught errors are thrown in hooks we now indicate Mocha's behavior as part of the error - that it is skipping the remaining tests in the current suite. Fixes [#240](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/240).\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   The reporter now more intelligently scrolls to prevent commands from being cut off. Useful in screenshots / video recording. Fixes [#228](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/228).\n*   We've improved the logic of how snapshots are restored so that it does not break the CSS when there were full page navigations in the test and the CSS changed. Fixes [#223](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/223).\n*   Iframes are now correctly handled when we restore snapshots. Previously, we removed iframes which would change the page layout and the hitboxes' coordinates we drew were wrong. Now we insert iframe placeholders that prevent the page layout from changing. Fixes [#234](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/234).\n*   Snapshot hitboxes no longer incorrectly draw for elements that are hidden. Fixes [#251](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/251).\n*   Fixed a bug that caused commands to time out on subsequent tests whenever there was an uncaught error + an assertion conflict. Fixes [#238](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/238).\n*   Fixed an edge case where assertions would incorrectly associate to a previously run assertion. Fixes [#252](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/252).\n*   Cypress commands now correctly execute in `after` and `afterEach` hooks on a failed test. Previously they would only run on passing tests. Fixes [#203](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/203).\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   We've bypassed Mocha's default uncaught error handling and replaced it with something much better - actually using the thrown error instances instead of creating a new arbitrary one. This means you'll see better stack traces on uncaught errors. Fixes [#193](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/193).\n*   We've bypassed Mocha's default uncaught error handling in a `hook`. Normally this immediately ends the run. Instead we are skipping the remaining tests in the current suite. This prevents skipping potentially dozens or hundreds of tests downstream that are typically unrelated to the hook failure.\n*   We've updated `cypress-cli` package to `0.12.0`. You will need to download this new CLI version if you want to pass `--reporter-options`.\n*   Bumped the internal version of `mocha` from `2.2.1` to `2.4.5`.\n\n## 0.17.4[​](#0-17-4 \"Direct link to 0.17.4\")\n\n_Released 09/12/2016_\n\n**Breaking Changes:**\n\n*   Using subsequent [`cy.visit()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/visit)'s _in the same test_ will not necessarily force a full page refresh. If all that changed was the hash of a url, then the hash changes will take affect **without** a full page refresh. This matches the behavior of a real browser. Previously [`cy.visit()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/visit) always forced a full page refresh and this was not correct.\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   Using [`cy.visit()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/visit) now acts _exactly_ how modifying the URL in a real browser works. This means that if you visit a url with a hash in it, instead of forcing a full page refresh, it will now modify the hash route as if you had manually changed it. This more accurately reflects real user behavior. Previously this was impossible to do with Cypress other than manually altering `window.location.hash`.\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Fixed a regression in `0.17.2` which caused **separate** tests that were visiting the same URL not to actually visit the new URL and eventually time out. We've updated some of our internal QA processes around this because we rarely have regressions and they are a pretty big deal. Fixes [#225](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/225).\n*   Fixed displaying `(null)` contentType when a [`cy.visit()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/visit) returned a `404` status code. We now only display `contentType` when one exists.\n\n## 0.17.3[​](#0-17-3 \"Direct link to 0.17.3\")\n\n_Released 09/11/2016_\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   When `visible` assertions such as `should('be.visible')` fail we now print the reason Cypress thought the element was invisible. Matches what Cypress prints out when attempting to interact with invisible elements. Fixes [#221](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/221).\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Prevent `Host` header from having its port appended when request was for port `80` or `443` which lead to 3rd party reverse proxy problems such as with `zeit.co` hosting. Fixes [#222](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/222).\n*   Send valid http response errors, and display new lines correctly. Fixes [#218](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/218).\n*   Correctly inject on `5xx` http response codes. Fixes [#217](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/217).\n*   Correctly inject on `4xx` and other bad http response codes when using Cypress as the file server. Fixes [#219](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/219).\n*   Correctly inject on `gzip` errors from 3rd party servers doing unintended things. Fixes [#220](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/220).\n\n## 0.17.2[​](#0-17-2 \"Direct link to 0.17.2\")\n\n_Released 09/06/2016_\n\n**Notes:**\n\n*   After this update if you are seeing `<iframe>` origin errors _please let us know_ by [opening an issue](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/new). We will screen-share with you to diagnose the issue. We're no longer aware of any situation where this should happen, so if you're experiencing these bugs, please help us track them down.\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   Attempting to [`cy.visit()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/visit) a non `text/html` resource will now throw a specific error message instead of bombing on page injection with an `<iframe`\\> origin error. You have to visit actual `html`, you cannot visit something like a `.json` or `.png`. If you're wanting to visit an API route on your back end that does something like set cookies (thus avoiding loading your UI) you can just use [`cy.request()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/request) for this since it will now automatically get and set cookies under the hood. Fixes [#211](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/211).\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Fixed a regression in `0.17.1` that was incorrectly setting `Cache` headers. This _could_ cause a situation where you received an `<iframe>` origin error. Additionally we now set `No-Cache` headers whenever we inject content, but otherwise respect the headers coming from web servers. When using Cypress as the file server, we set `etags` but prevent caching.\n*   Most likely fixed a bug that was crashing Cypress due to `Cannot set headers after they've been sent`. We were unable to write a test for this since we could not recreate the error, but analyzed how it _may_ happen and fixed the code there. [open an issue](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/new) if you see this error, it will be obvious since Cypress will literally crash.\n*   We stopped minifying `vendor.js` (for real this time). More optimizations to come around this.\n*   Prevented accidentally setting `domain` cookies when they were really `hostOnly` cookies, thus duplicating the number of cookies sent on requests. Kudos to [@bahmutov](https://github.com/bahmutov) for finding this one. Fixes [#207](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/207).\n*   Fixed some edge cases in `cypress-core-extension` where it threw errors when attempting to `executeScript` on a tab with `about:blank` or `chrome://` urls.\n*   We've fixed some underlying issues with [`cy.go()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/go) during `cypress run`. It always worked fine in real Chrome. Previously there were some situations where it would not navigate forward / back correctly.\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   No longer force [`cy.visit()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/visit) to navigate to `about:blank` prior to navigating to the real url. Fixes [#208](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/208).\n*   [`cy.writeFile()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/writefile) can now accept an empty string. Fixes [#206](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/206).\n*   Improved error messages for [`cy.readFile()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/readfile) and [`cy.writeFile()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/writefile).\n*   The full file path is now included in console output for [`cy.readFile()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/readfile) and [`cy.writeFile()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/writefile).\n*   The [Kitchen Sink](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-example-kitchensink) and `example_spec.js` have been updated to reflect the newest changes and features of `0.17.1`.\n\n## 0.17.1[​](#0-17-1 \"Direct link to 0.17.1\")\n\n_Released 08/31/2016_\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   You can now pass keyboard modifiers such as `ctrl`, `cmd`, `shift`, and `alt` to [`.type()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/type). In addition we've added support for not \"releasing\" these keys so they can affect other actions such as [`.click()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/click). Addresses [#196](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/196).\n*   You can now type into the `<body>` or `document` as opposed to previously _having_ to target a valid focusable element. This is useful in situations where you're testing keyboard shortcuts and do not want to target a specific element. Addresses [#150](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/150).\n*   There is a new command [`cy.readFile()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/readfile) that reads files on your file system and changes the subject to the contents. Addresses [#179](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/179).\n*   There is a new command [`cy.writeFile()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/writefile) that creates and/or writes contents to files on your file system. Addresses [#179](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/179).\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   [`defaultCommandTimeout`](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration#Timeouts) now works correctly. The driver was still referencing the old `commandTimeout` value.\n*   The `__cypress.initial` cookie should now be removed during any [`cy.visit()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/visit), which should fix some edge cases with the proxy accidentally injecting content when it shouldn't. We also added a ton more e2e tests covering these edge cases and other behavior.\n*   The proxy now restricts its injection to only `Content-Type: text/html` headers so it will not accidentally inject into the wrong responses.\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   All [`cy.fixture()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/fixture) extensions are now supported and Cypress will no longer throw on extensions it doesn't recognize. For known fixture extensions we'll continue to apply a default `encoding` and for everything else it will default to `utf8`. Fixes [#200](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/200).\n*   [`cy.fixture()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/fixture) now accepts `encoding` as a 2nd optional argument.\n*   We now display a keyboard 'modifiers' column when clicking on a [`.type()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/type) in the Command Log.\n\n## 0.17.0[​](#0-17-0 \"Direct link to 0.17.0\")\n\n_Released 08/30/2016_\n\n**Overview:**\n\n*   The desktop application has been completely redesigned. We have moved from a tray application to a standard dock application. The list of projects is now in the same window as the list of tests in a project. As each test runs, the application highlights the currently running spec and displays the browser version running. The configuration of a project is now displayed in its own tab. There is now a Desktop Menu where you can logout, check for updates, or view help links.\n*   The test [runner](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/tree/develop/packages/runner) has been rebuilt from the ground up in [React.js](https://reactjs.org/). The left side of the runner called the [reporter](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/tree/develop/packages/reporter) is now a separate application. This, as well as other changes, markedly improved the performance of running tests. _Your tests will now run faster._ This will also enable you to test your application in full screen. Additionally this paves the way for being able to spawn multiple browsers at once and synchronize testing across them. This also means we'll be able to support mobile browsers. The UI for doing this hasn't been implemented but the vast majority of the work to accomplish this is done now.\n*   We have rewritten the entire proxy layer of the Cypress server to finally fix all the problems with CORS.\n\n**Breaking Changes:**\n\n*   You cannot [`cy.visit()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/visit) two different super domains within a single test. Example: `cy.visit('https://cypress.io').visit('https://anotherwebsite.com')`. There shouldn't be any reason you ever need to do this in a single test, if you do, you should make these two separate tests.\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   _All CORS related issues should finally be fixed now._ Cypress now internally switches to the domain that you used in your [`cy.visit()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/visit). This means that the correct domain will display in the URL based on the application currently under test. Your application's code will run under the current domain at all times. Previously we implemented an endless amount of hacks and internal translations to figure out the domain you were _supposed_ to be on without actually being on the domain. This caused code to behave different and caused subtle issues. Those issues should now be resolved. The entire proxy layer has been rewritten to handle all HTTPS certificates flawlessly, continue to inject (even on HTTPS pages), and still know when to automatically bypass injection so you can open other tabs while testing in Cypress. These new proxy changes also unlock the ability to do things like allowing or blocking specific 3rd party domains, or even be able to stub not just XHR's but any kind of HTTP request.\n*   `window.fetch` now works correctly. Stubbing these does not yet work but it is now possible for us to implement stubbing in a future version. Addresses [#95](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/95).\n*   The list of tests now automatically refresh when test files are renamed, deleted, or added. In addition, because the list of tests is now displayed in the desktop application, we now synchronize the state of the current running spec.\n*   [`cy.visit()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/visit) has better error messages. Cypress now programmatically determines why a [`cy.visit()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/visit) failed and gives you a ridiculously accurate error message. Addresses [#138](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/138).\n*   [`cy.visit()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/visit) now displays redirects and any cookies set.\n*   The currently running test is now scrolled into view. This behavior can be turned off by scrolling in the Command Log or selecting to disable auto-scroll at the top of the Command Log. Addresses [#194](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/194)\n*   Tests in the Command Log now automatically expand when specific commands take longer than `1000ms` to run. Previously when running more than 1 test we did not expand commands until a test failed. Now they will be expanded and automatically collapsed whenever a single command is taking a long time to finish.\n*   We now have full blown subdomain support. This means you can now navigate to a subdomain either directly via a [`cy.visit()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/visit) or by navigating in your application naturally (such as clicking an `<a>`).\n*   [`cy.request()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/request) now attaches and sets cookies transparently on the browser. Even though the browser will not physically make the request, we automatically apply outgoing cookies _as if_ the browser had made the request. Additionally we will automatically _set_ cookies on the browser based on the response. This means you can use [`cy.request()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/request) to bypass not just CORS but handle things like automatically logging in without having to manually perform these actions in the UI.\n*   We now handle HTTP request errors much better. Previously if your web server sent us back a `4xx` or `5xx` response we would automatically send back a `500`. Now we transparently pass these through.\n*   Improved dozens of error messages.\n*   [`.debug()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/debug) output has been improved, and you can now easily inspect the current command's subject.\n*   Clicking the URL in the header of the runner now opens that URL in a new tab.\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Fixed URL proxy issue with subdomains. Fixes [#183](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/183).\n*   Viewport size maximum has been decreased from `3001px` to `3000px` and minimum has been increased from `199px` to `200px` to match error messages. Fixes [#189](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/189)\n*   WebSockets are now correctly proxied through HTTPS and through subdomains different than the current domain under test.\n*   Stopped [`.debug()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/debug) from accidentally mutating subjects.\n*   Cypress now correctly injects and handles pages which are missing a `<head>`, a `<body`\\>, or even an `<html>` tag. Previously it would bomb on pages missing these tags.\n*   All commands with a long message (such as assertions) are automatically scaled down in font size and truncated properly. In addition, assertions will correctly bold the `expected` and `actual` values.\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   [cypress run](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-run) no longer requires being logged in.\n*   Renamed configuration option `commandTimeout` to [`defaultCommandTimeout`](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration). Cypress will transparently rewrite this if you have it in your `cypress.json`, so you don't have to do anything.\n*   Renamed `onConsole` and `onRender` Command Log options to `consoleProps` and `renderProps`. We still support the older property names for backwards compatibility.\n*   Added support for a command's `message` or `renderProps.message` to use markdown.\n*   The default value of `port` within a project's global [configuration](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration) has changed from `2020` to now being a random open port. You can still configure a specific `port` if needed within the [configuration](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration).\n*   We have upgraded the `Chromium` that runs headlessly on [cypress run](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-run) to version `51`.\n*   The internal version of `node` which is built into Cypress is now `6.1.0`.\n*   Cypress `.js` files are no longer minified to make them easier to debug.\n*   We are cleaning up internal `__cypress` cookies more so they won't get in the way of testing your application.\n*   We now opt into `gzip` handling instead of forcing requests to omit it.\n*   The runner is now responsive. It will correctly scale down URLs on smaller screen sizes instead of looking completely broken in CSS. We also designed a much better loading indicator.\n*   Added button to the reporter that focuses the Test Runner and shows the list of tests.\n*   The reporter now updates the duration every `100ms` instead of only when a test changes.\n*   In the reporter, suites that are pending or contain only pending tests have the blue \"pending\" indicator on the left instead of the white \"processing\" indicator.\n\n## 0.16.5[​](#0-16-5 \"Direct link to 0.16.5\")\n\n_Released 07/31/2016_\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Force exit codes that are `null` to `0`. Fixes [#184](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/184).\n\n## 0.16.4[​](#0-16-4 \"Direct link to 0.16.4\")\n\n_Released 06/17/2016_\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Fixed regression caused by `0.16.2` where a failed [`cy.contains()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/contains) would not be canceled and would continue to run and display failed assertions in between test runs (without a full page refresh). Fixes [#174](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/174).\n\n## 0.16.3[​](#0-16-3 \"Direct link to 0.16.3\")\n\n_Released 06/17/2016_\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   `cy.route()` now accepts string glob patterns using [minimatch](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch) under the hood. This means you can more easily route dynamic urls without using `regex`. Example: `cy.route('POST', '/users/*/comments', {})`.\n*   [`Cypress.minimatch`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/utilities/minimatch) is now exposed so you can easily test globbing patterns.\n*   [`.type()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/type) can now be used on non-input elements that have a `tabindex` attribute. Key events will fire but no text content will change and no input based events fire. Fixes [#172](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/172).\n*   There is now an [`ignoreTestFiles`](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration) configuration option that accepts an array of `glob` patterns. This enables you to ignore extraneous spec files that may be created during a build process. The default pattern is `*.hot-update.js` which will ignore dynamically generated webpack hot module swapping files. Fixes [#159](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/159).\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Fixed a bug where Cypress could get into a weird state and continuously error due to the `before:log` event not being properly disposed. Fixes [#173](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/173).\n*   Fixed a bug where invalid UTF-8 characters were being set in XHR headers which caused XHR's to fail. We now properly encode and decode all values. Fixes [#168](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/168).\n*   Nested directories under `cypress/support` no longer cause a `500` when tests run. This was due to Cypress not ignoring directories and trying to serve them as regular files. Fixes [#163](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/163).\n*   Fixed situations where 3rd party libraries (such as [New Relic](https://newrelic.com/) were instrumenting XHR's identical to Cypress' implementation. This caused an infinite loop which would crash the browser. We've updated how we instrument XHR's to take this into account and deployed multiple fallbacks and strategies to prevent this kind of thing from happening in the future. Fixes [#166](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/166).\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   `Cypress.Server.defaults()` now accepts a `urlMatchingOptions` option for passing options to [minimatch](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch).\n*   [cypress run](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-run) now exits with the number of test failures instead of always exiting with 0. This matches the same way `cypress ci` works. Fixes [#167](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/167).\n*   In the [Cypress CLI tool](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line) package version `0.11.1`, you can now pass the `--spec` option to `cypress ci`. This enables you to run a specific spec file as opposed to all tests. Fixes [#161](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/161).\n\n## 0.16.2[​](#0-16-2 \"Direct link to 0.16.2\")\n\n_Released 06/11/2016_\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   Added new [`cy.screenshot()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/screenshot) command which can take screenshots on demand.\n*   When running `cypress run` or in CI, Cypress will now automatically take a screenshot when a test fails. You can optionally turn this off by setting [`screenshotOnHeadlessFailure`](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration#Screenshots) to `false` in your configuration.\n*   Added new [`screenshotsFolder`](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration#Screenshots) configuration option with default of `cypress/screenshots`.\n*   When running in [Circle CI](https://circleci.com/), we automatically export screenshots as artifacts which makes them available directly in their web UI. If you're using Circle CI, you'll be able to see screenshots without doing anything. If you're using [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/), you'll need to upload artifacts to an `s3 bucket`. This is a small slice of what is coming to help diagnose and understand errors in CI. Also in `0.17.0` we will automatically scroll the tests and more intelligently and open / close test commands so you can visually see what happened. Currently you may not see the test command's failure in the Command Log due to the view not scrolling.\n*   Added new [`.each()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/each) command which iterates serially on a collection yielding the iteratee, the index, and the collection. Addresses [#156](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/156).\n*   `cy.route()` can now accept a single function and/or you can pass a function to the `response` property. This allows you to lazily evaluate routing responses. Great for referencing fixtures. Addresses [#152](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/152).\n*   [`cy.contains()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/contains) now accepts a regular expression. Addresses [#158](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/158).\n*   [`.type()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/type) now accepts `{downarrow}` and `{uparrow}`. We do not move the caret but do fire all the proper events. Addresses [#157](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/157).\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   [`cy.exec()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/exec) now outputs additional `stderr` and `stdout` information. It additionally will automatically `source` your `$SHELL` which makes GUI apps behave as if they've been launched from your terminal. Fixes [#153](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/153) and [#154](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/154).\n*   [`.then()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/then) yielding nested subjects.\n*   [`cy.contains()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/contains) no longer returns the last element found when siblings both contain the same content. Fixes [#158](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/158).\n*   Cypress no longer errors when you return a raw DOM element. It now correctly wraps this as the new subject.\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   [`cy.contains()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/contains) now provides an even more specific error message when it was scoped to a particular DOM element and contained a selector. Fixes [#160](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/160).\n*   You will now see a very specific error message when we detect that you've mixed up `async` and `sync` code in a [`.then()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/then) callback function. An example would be queuing up a new cypress command but then synchronously returning a different value.\n\n## 0.16.1[​](#0-16-1 \"Direct link to 0.16.1\")\n\n_Released 05/22/2016_\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   [`Cypress.Cookies.debug()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/cypress-api/cookies#Debug) now works again. Additionally it provides much more feedback than it used to.\n*   [`Cypress.Cookies.debug(true, {verbose: false})`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/cypress-api/cookies#Debug) option has been added to remove verbose cookie object logging.\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Copy / Paste now works when logging in on OSX. Fixes [#145](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/145).\n*   Grammar: 'Login -> Log in'. Fixes [#146](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/146).\n*   Cypress now uses the body instead of headers to send external requests. Fixes [#148](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/148).\n*   When [`.then()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/then) throws this no longer prevents the next test from issuing any commands. Fixes [#149](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/149).\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   Passing multiple arguments to [`.its()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/its) now throws and suggests you use [`.invoke()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/invoke). Fixes [#147](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/147).\n\n## 0.16.0[​](#0-16-0 \"Direct link to 0.16.0\")\n\n_Released 05/17/2016_\n\n**Notes:**\n\n*   Updating through the Desktop App in **Linux** does not work. To update please run [cypress install](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line) from the command line.\n*   We are still updating the docs to reflect all of these changes.\n*   All users must _LOG IN AGAIN_ and re-add their projects. Sorry, we've changed the way we store local data.\n\n**Overview:**\n\n*   `0.16.0` marks a significant change for Cypress. Before this we only issued commands using regular JavaScript and coordinated these with the back end server which is running. As of `0.16.0` we are now tapping into the underlying browser automation libraries which enable us to exceed the limitations of the JavaScript sandbox. This means we have total control over the browser for more powerful automation tooling. The downside is that we have only implemented these APIs for Chrome, and therefore running on multiple browsers will no longer work. This is a temporary setback as we'll be adding driver support for all of the other browsers over a period of time. You can read more about our browser management [here](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/launching-browsers).\n\n**Breaking Changes:**\n\n*   Running tests in Cypress now requires either Chrome, Chromium, or Canary to be installed on your OS environment. We intend to expand support for more browsers in the future, but for now, only these 3 are supported.\n*   Removed support for `Cypress.Cookies.get`, `Cypress.Cookies.set` and `Cypress.Cookies.remove`.\n*   Changed return of [`cy.getCookies()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/getcookies) to return an array of cookies, each with properties include name, value, etc.\n*   Changed return of [`cy.clearCookies()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/clearcookies) to return null (previously was returning Cookie that was cleared).\n*   [`Cypress.Cookies.debug()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/cypress-api/cookies#Debug) has been temporarily disabled and will be re-enabled later.\n*   Browsers are spawned in a Cypress specific profile so that we can maintain a clean state apart of your regular browsing usage. You will notice that your extensions are no longer installed. This is on purpose. 3rd party extensions can often get in the way of Cypress and cause failures. However, developer specific extensions for Angular, Ember, and React do not cause any issues but you'll want to reinstall them. You only have to install them once and they will persist.\n*   The `whitelist` callback function of [`Cypress.Cookies.defaults()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/cypress-api/cookies#History) now receives a `cookie object` instead of just the `cookies name` as a string.\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   When a project is initially run from the desktop app, you can now choose to run Cypress in a select number of browsers including: Chrome, Chromium, or Canary (depending on what's installed on your OS).\n*   Browser sessions are spawned independently of your existing profiles and we've disabled things like password saving / prompting, JavaScript popup blocking, and other features which get in the way of testing. Read more [here](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/launching-browsers)\n*   We automatically spawn Chrome in a **custom theme** so you can visually distinguish the difference between browser sessions spawned with Cypress vs your normal sessions. We know this may feel a little jarring because you're used to running Cypress alongside your other tabs. You will now see 2 chrome icons in your dock and you'll need to switch between them. We know this is problematic and confusing and we're looking into **changing the icon** of the Chrome running Cypress so it's easier to tell the Chrome sessions apart.\n*   Added new commands to handle getting, setting, and clearing cookies: [`cy.clearCookie()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/clearcookie), [`cy.getCookie()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/getcookie), and [`cy.setCookie()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/setcookie).\n*   All the `cy.cookie` commands have been upgraded to take new options and can do much more powerful things outside of the JavaScript sandbox.\n*   Upgraded the Chromium version running headlessly and in CI from `47` to `49`.\n*   There is a new [`cy.exec()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/exec) command that can execute any arbitrary system command. Additionally there is a new [`execTimeout`](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration#Timeouts) configuration option which is set to `60s` by default. Fixes [#126](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/126).\n*   There is a new [`numTestsKeptInMemory`](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration#Global) configuration option that controls how many test's snapshots and command data is kept in memory while tests are running. Reducing this number will reduce the memory used in the browser while tests are running. Whatever this number is - is how many tests you can walk back in time when inspecting their snapshots and return values. Addresses [#142](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/142).\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Cypress taskbar icon now displays correctly in OS X dark theme. Fixes [#132](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/132).\n*   Fixed issue where server error's stack traces were being truncated in the Desktop app rendering them impossible to debug. Fixes [#133](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/133).\n*   woff Fonts are now properly served from a local file system when using Cypress' web server. Fixes [#135](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/135).\n*   When an element's center is not visible the error message now includes the stringified element in question, and not `undefined`.\n*   Typing into an `input[type=tel]` now works. Fixes [#141](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/141).\n*   XHR's which have their `onload` handler replaced after `XHR#send` is called is now properly accounted for. Fixes [#143](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/143).\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   XHR requests for `.svg` files are no longer shown in the Command Log by default. Addresses [#131](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/131).\n*   Improved error when [`cy.request()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/request) fails. The request parameters are now included in the error. Addresses [#134](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/134).\n*   When running a project in the new Cypress browser environment, if a new tab is opened, a message now displays discouraging the use of multiple tabs while testing. Addresses [#9](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/9).\n*   When navigating directly to `localhost:2020` outside of the new Cypress browser environment, a message now displays discouraging running tests outside of the new Cypress browser environment.\n*   If, for whatever reason, Cypress cannot communicate with the automation servers, your testing session will immediately end and you'll have the ability to re-spawn the browser.\n*   [`cy.fixture()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/fixture) now has a default timeout of `responseTimeout` which is `20s`.\n*   [`cy.fixture()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/fixture) can now properly time out and accepts an `options` argument that can override its default timeout.\n*   Improved initial Desktop Application startup performance by about `1.5s`.\n*   We now correctly store local data in each operating system's correct `Application Data` area. This will be more resilient to upgrades in the future.\n*   Running Cypress in a linux VM on VirtualBox no longer displays \"black screens\".\n*   Our internal proxy no longer strips `HttpOnly` cookie flags.\n*   Improved command errors and normalized many of them. Fixes [#137](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/137).\n*   JavaScript popup blocking is now disabled and will not interfere with running tests. Fixes [#125](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/125).\n*   We now capture synchronous errors from XHR `onreadystatechange` handlers.\n\n## 0.15.4[​](#0-15-4 \"Direct link to 0.15.4\")\n\n_Released 04/22/2016_\n\n**Notes:**\n\n*   The docs have not yet been updated to reflect the changes to [`.its()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/its) and [`.invoke()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/invoke).\n\n**Breaking Changes:**\n\n*   You can no longer improperly use [`.its()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/its) and [`.invoke()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/invoke). Using [`.invoke()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/invoke) on a non function property will result in an error that tells you how to write it properly using [`.its()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/its).\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   Our [chat](https://gitter.im/cypress-io/cypress) has now been directly integrated into Cypress's nav. Clicking on the `chat` icon will immediately display the current gitter chat log.\n*   Added a new link to Options dropdown in Desktop app for \"Chat\" that goes to our [chat](https://gitter.im/cypress-io/cypress).\n*   [`.its()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/its) and [`.invoke()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/invoke) now support **dot separated** nested properties.\n*   Using [`.its()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/its) on a function will now allow you to access its properties instead of automatically calling a function. Fixes [#122](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/122).\n*   Error messages and command messages for [`.its()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/its) and [`.invoke()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/invoke) have been improved.\n*   Adding an attribute called `data-cypress-ignore` to an element will prevent the internal Cypress proxy from rewriting any of its content or attributes.\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   During `cypress run`, windows created with `window.open` will no longer physically display. They are now correctly headless. Fixes [#123](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/123).\n*   The auto generated `example_spec.js` no longer errors on `cy.visit('app/index.html')` since that file would likely not locally exist.\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   Better error handling of unauthorized users attempting to login to Cypress with improved [Login documentation](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress).\n\n## 0.15.3[​](#0-15-3 \"Direct link to 0.15.3\")\n\n_Released 04/10/2016_\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   Cypress will now [display the **resolved** configuration values when you open a project](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration#Resolved-Configuration). This tells you the source of all config values.\n*   The latest version of the [Cypress CLI](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line) now accepts passing arguments to [cypress open](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-open). Example: `cypress open --config waitForAnimations=false --env foo=bar,baz=quux`. This enables you to set and override local `cypress.json` configuration and additionally set environment variables.\n*   [Environment Variables](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/environment-variables) that match any configuration keys (such as `pageLoadTimeout` or `watchForFileChanges`) now override their values. So, if you `export CYPRESS_WATCH_FOR_FILE_CHANGES=false` it will turn off this configuration option. Also note that we'll automatically normalize environment keys so: `CYPRESS_pageLoadTimeout=100000` and `CYPRESS_PAGE_LOAD_TIMEOUT=100000` will both be correctly handled. We'll also coerce values into `Boolean` or `Number` correctly.\n*   Cypress now correctly proxies WebSockets that are pointed at the local Cypress server (typically `localhost:2020`). Because most users use [Socket.io](http://socket.io/), when Socket.io could not correctly connect over WebSockets it would fall back to XHR polling. You may notice many less XHR requests in your command log (which is the intended behavior).\n*   The tray icon in OSX will now change colors. It will turn blue when you're running a Cypress project and red on any kind of failures such as syntax errors in `cypress.json`. It will turn back black when nothing is actively running.\n*   The title of your project is now the title of the browser tab (so you can easily tell Cypress tabs from one another).\n*   There is now a link to our [chat](https://gitter.im/cypress-io/cypress) in the navigation of the web app.\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   The `-s` or `--spec` option now works correctly. You now must pass a relative or absolute path to your spec file. This is much less confusing, allows you to easily autocomplete entries from bash, and will support `unitFolder` later when it's added. Assuming you want to run a spec file that is located in `cypress/integration/foo_spec.js` you would pass: `cypress run --spec 'cypress/integration/foo_spec.js'`. Previously you could just pass `--spec foo_spec.js` which now no longer works (and was broken anyway). Fixes [#120](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/120).\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   Open sourced another core repo: [Cypress Core Test Runner](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/tree/develop/packages/desktop-gui) which makes up the Cypress Desktop Application.\n*   Improved the [error message](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/74#issuecomment-208422453) displayed to users on Windows attempting to download the Cypress Desktop app.\n\n## 0.15.2[​](#0-15-2 \"Direct link to 0.15.2\")\n\n_Released 04/03/2016_\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   The [error message when Cypress detects that a test has ended early](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/error-messages) (there are still commands left in the queue) now displays a list of these commands with a much improved explanation.\n*   There is now a new [configuration option](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration): `watchForFileChanges` that, when set to `false` in the `cypress.json`, will prevent Cypress from attempting to watch for file changes and restart your tests.\n*   You can now set the default [`reporter`](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration) in `cypress.json` for use during `cypress run` or in CI.\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   The [\\--reporter](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-run) CLI option is now working again.\n*   the `teamcity` reporter is now also working again.\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   Updated favicon + logo mark\n\n## 0.15.1[​](#0-15-1 \"Direct link to 0.15.1\")\n\n_Released 04/01/2016_\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   [`cy.go()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/go) and [`cy.reload()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/reload) now accept a timeout option. Also, these commands would previously time out after the default `commandTimeout` of `4000ms`, but now they will timeout after `pageLoadTimeout` of `30000ms`.\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   When an integration test file is unable to run and the `integrationFolder` is not the default path, the UI error now properly prints the integration test file's path by stripping off `integration` in the path. Fixes [#117](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/117).\n*   `Cypress.Dom.isHidden()` will now throw error when it isn't passed a DOM element.\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   Renamed [configuration](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration) option `visitTimeout` to `pageLoadTimeout`. You don't need to change anything. If you were specifically setting `visitTimeout` in your `cypress.json` file it will be transparently rewritten `pageLoadTimeout` on the next server boot. This option was renamed because now multiple commands `cy.visit()`, `cy.go()`, and `cy.reload()` all depend on this timeout option.\n*   The Cypress tray icon has been updated. It's much better now.\n\n## 0.15.0[​](#0-15-0 \"Direct link to 0.15.0\")\n\n_Released 03/28/2016_\n\n**Overview:**\n\n*   As we get closer to a public release we've decided to focus on onboarding new users and new projects. We've made several breaking changes to help with this process.\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   There is now an `example_spec.js` file that is scaffolded on new projects. This allows new users to instantly see Cypress successfully running on an example project and will answer many questions on writing your first tests. This `example_spec.js` file contains every single Cypress command and has approximately 70 tests.\n*   Added a welcome dialog for new projects that explains how Cypress scaffolds out its folder structure. This dialog will only display if Cypress detects that you haven't written any tests or changed the initial `example_spec.js` file. The welcome dialog will no longer display after you've changed or added any tests.\n*   Added the ability to click on file/folder links from within the Cypress webapp that will spawn your OS file/folder finder and show you where the files are located in your project.\n*   There is now a default `cypress` folder that contains your test files, a `fixtures` folder with an example fixture, and a `support` folder with example support files. Inside `cypress` there is an `integration` folder that will contain your integration tests.\n*   You can now turn off `supportFolder` and `fixturesFolder` by passing `false` in `cypress.json`. This will automatically remove the folders the next time you open your project in Cypress. Fixes [#102](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/102).\n*   Restyled the tests list.\n\n**Breaking Changes:**\n\n*   Cypress no longer looks at your `tests` directory for test files. Now, by default, it looks in the `cypress/integration` directory.\n*   We've removed the configuration option `testFolder` and renamed it to [`integrationFolder`](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/legacy-configuration#Folders--Files) inside of the `cypress.json`.\n*   We've renamed the `cypress` npm package to be `cypress-cli`. You'll see a giant deprecation warning until your scripts have been updated to reference `cypress-cli`.. You can also uninstall the `cypress` npm package.\n*   Added new [`fileServerFolder`](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/legacy-configuration#Folders--Files) configuration option that can mount a directory other than your project root when using Cypress as a web server.\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   Using [`.hover()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/hover) will provide a detailed error message with a link for working around hover constraints. Addresses [#10](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/10)\n*   Internal routing errors in Cypress are now gracefully handled with `x-cypress-error` and `x-cypress-stack` set on response headers.\n*   Updated all of the repo names to be modular.\n\n**What you need to do**:\n\n*   We did not write an automatic migration from `tests` -> `cypress`\n*   You need to manually move your existing test files from `tests` into `cypress/integration`.\n*   [Come into the chat](https://gitter.im/cypress-io/cypress) if you have any problems or need help.\n\nMore Info:\n\n*   Why did you change the default test folder to be `cypress/integration`.\n*   We are adding support for unit testing in the near future and decided that there needs to be a separation between `unit` and `integration` tests. The actual runner will handle these two sets of specs very differently. It's important to make the change now so when we do add support for unit tests, you only have to create a `unit` folder inside of your `cypress` folder.\n\n## 0.14.3[​](#0-14-3 \"Direct link to 0.14.3\")\n\n_Released 03/20/2016_\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   Added [`cy.getCookies()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/getcookies) command for easy chain-ability. Fixes [#103](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/103).\n*   Cypress now outputs its version when passed the `--version` argument\n*   If you are not logged in on OSX, Cypress now issues a native system notification indicating to you that Cypress is running in your tray (many users often complained they could not tell Cypress was actually running)\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Handle clearing cookies better when they are created on a path other than `/`. Fixes [#104](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/104).\n*   Issuing Cypress Commands inside of a Promise now works. Fixes [#111](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/111).\n*   'Add Project' dialog is no longer lost on blur. Fixes [#115](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/115).\n*   Desktop windows that are transparent no longer lose their box shadow.\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   `cy.visit()` callback functions: `onBeforeLoad` and `onLoad` are now invoked with the current runnables context instead of with `cy`. This makes accessing properties in your tests much easier.\n\n## 0.14.2[​](#0-14-2 \"Direct link to 0.14.2\")\n\n_Released 03/14/2016_\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Chaining more cy commands after using [`cy.wrap()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/wrap) now works. Fixes [#114](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/114).\n*   Cypress now handles events property when a DOM element is removed during a `.click()` event. As per the spec, if `mousedown` causes element removal then `mouseup` and `click` and `focus` events will not be fired. Additionally if removal happens during `mouseup` then `click` event will not be fired. Also updated the `onConsole` groups to only display and indicate the events which actually fired. Fixes [#109](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/109).\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   Removed `fa-refresh` icons next to suites and tests until this behavior has been reimplemented due to ID removal.\n*   Removed resetting the runnable timeout when a `page load` event resolves. This prevents an edge case where the next test may show as timed out during `cypress run`.\n\n## 0.14.1[​](#0-14-1 \"Direct link to 0.14.1\")\n\n_Released 03/13/2016_\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   Project ID's and `cypress.json` are now only generated once you start your Cypress server. Previously they were created initially when you choose the project folder. This now means you won't have to cleanup excess files if you accidentally select the wrong folder. Additionally you can now use Cypress 100% offline. Previously the GUI would block until the project had an ID but this restriction has been lifted.\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   The proxy server can now correctly proxy content on a `ipv6` host only. We had to patch node core to get this in, as by default node prefers `ipv4`. We now concurrently test all hosts via `dns.lookup` to find the first one that responds. This updated behavior now matches how other clients, like `curl`, and browsers resolve hosts. Fixes [#112](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/112).\n*   Simplified how Cypress stores projects and fixed some edge cases where Cypress would send an outdated Project ID.\n*   Prevent server from opening and immediately closing + re-opening when project is missing a Project ID and one is generated.\n*   Using Cypress as a file server and serving a file that's part of a folder that has a name containing a space now works. Fixes [#113](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/113).\n*   The existing `.cy` cache and settings are now correctly copied again after an app update.\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   Projects without an ID now error correctly when running in CI.\n*   When Cypress cannot proxy http content due to a software error it will attach a `x-cypress-error` and `x-cypress-stack` to the HTTP request for easy inspection and debugging.\n*   Cypress will now output its internal logger directly to the console when `CYPRESS_DEBUG` env var is set.\n*   Replaced Ruby / Compass with `node saas`.\n\n## 0.14.0[​](#0-14-0 \"Direct link to 0.14.0\")\n\n_Released 03/08/2016_\n\n**Summary:**\n\n*   This update represents mostly a lot of internal structure changes. We swapped out the underlying Desktop architecture and refactored all of the back end code to prepare for an open source release.\n*   If you choose to install Cypress from the [CLI Tool](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line) you must update to the latest version `0.9.1`. Just run `npm install -g cypress` and then you can run [cypress install](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line). You don't need to do anything if you update from within the Test Runner itself.\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   The Desktop App has been re-skinned with misc GUI enhancements such as help text, popovers, clearer errors, better loading indicators, etc.\n*   The Desktop App's file size is now much smaller and unzips much faster. In the next release there will be a special `CI` build which removes the need to run Xvfb.\n*   Test IDs have been removed. You will no longer see Cypress insert IDs into your test files. This was a feature we implemented on day 1 - the idea being we could track test performance and do regression analysis. Unfortunately, it will be a long time before we actually implement the data science to make this happen. For the time being, IDs presented unnecessary technical complexity and challenges with no real upside. We recommend you remove all of your existing IDs. We've added a new command to the CLI tool that can do this in one shot. `cypress remove:ids` You may see IDs be reintroduced at a later time when we provide analytics.\n*   [`.then()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/then) now supports a `timeout` option. Fixes [#110](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/110).\n*   All error messages from using the CLI have been rewritten and improved.\n*   Cypress will now automatically prompt you to add a project when using [cypress run](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-run) on a project that has not yet been added.\n*   Domain cookies are now proxied better. There's still more work to do before they are 100% fixed but now most typical domain cookie scenarios should 'just work'.\n*   We've put together a new example repo called [The Kitchen Sink](https://github.com/cypress-io/examples-kitchen-sink). It demonstrates usage of every single Cypress command.\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Using [cypress run](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-run) in OSX now works again.\n*   Added fs polling support to fix issues where Cypress would not detect file changes.\n*   Tests should reload inside of Cypress faster when they are changed.\n*   Better error messages when a command times out waiting for a promise to resolve. Fixes [#108](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/108).\n*   [`cy.viewport('ipad-2')`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/viewport) now displays by default in portrait. Landscape orientation is now properly landscape. Fixes [#100](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/100).\n*   [`.click()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/click) will now properly click within an element's bounding box when a `position` option is passed and the calculated coordinates are a fraction. This previously forced the click to happen outside of the element. Fixes [#99](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/99).\n*   `clientX` and `clientY` event properties are now correctly calculated for elements when the page is scrolled. Fixes [#98](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/98).\n*   [`.check()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/check) and [`.uncheck()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/uncheck) now correctly filter down the subject when a value is passed as an option. Fixes [#94](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/94).\n*   The Test Runner will now display your email address when you have not set a name in GitHub.\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   Improved element display in Command Log when multiple elements are part of an assertion. Fixes [#96](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/96).\n*   [`cy.reload()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/reload) now returns the window object of the newly reloaded page. Fixes [#105](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/105).\n\nKnown Issues:\n\n*   Clicking the 'reload' icon next to a test that does not have an ID will not work anymore. We're reworking this feature to work without the presence of IDs.\n\n## 0.13.9[​](#0-13-9 \"Direct link to 0.13.9\")\n\n_Released 01/28/2016_\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Prevent regression with not automatically scaling the viewport to fit into the window size\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   Update links to match new [documentation](https://docs.cypress.io/)\n*   [`.debug()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/debug) has been zipped up - it no longer logs confusing debugging information and now logs information about the previously run command.\n*   [`Cypress._`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/utilities/_), [`Cypress.$`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/utilities/$), [`Cypress.Promise`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/utilities/promise), [`Cypress.Blob`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/utilities/blob), `Cypress.moment` utilities have been moved off of `cy` and are now attached to `Cypress`. This is much more consistent with how the `cy` and `Cypress` APIs work. You can continue to use these objects off of `cy` but this has been deprecated and you will see a warning message.\n\n## 0.13.8[​](#0-13-8 \"Direct link to 0.13.8\")\n\n_Released 01/24/2016_\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   Added [`cy.reload()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/reload) command which does a full page refresh. This is the same as the user hitting the 'Reload' button. Additionally it matches the same argument signature as `window.location.reload`.\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Fixed situation where [`cy.viewport()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/viewport) would not restore correctly between tests. Previously this would cause subsequent tests to be issued at the modified `cy.viewport()`. Now viewport is automatically restored to the settings in your `cypress.json` file.\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   Using [`.its()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/its) on a function or [`.invoke()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/invoke) on a property now logs a deprecation warning. In the next major release this will become a full error. It is valuable to make a distinction whether you're operating on a property vs a function, and this change improves overall readability with less confusion.\n*   Cypress deprecations and warnings are now prefixed with: `Cypress Warning:` to indicate this message is coming from Cypress\n\n## 0.13.7[​](#0-13-7 \"Direct link to 0.13.7\")\n\n_Released 01/17/2016_\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Prevent error during element stringification on `<svg>`. Fixes [#93](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/93).\n*   Clarified on errors related to not being able to run in CI. Previously there was a \"catch all\" error indicating your Cypress API Key was invalid. This was oftentimes incorrect. More specific errors have been added.\n*   [`.type()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/type) has been upgraded to handle current selection ranges. Previously if an `<input>` had a selection range as Cypress began to type, this would be ignored. Cypress now takes this into account and will type over any selected text (as native typing would do).\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   All Cypress related services have been updated to use HTTPS. We are forcing HTTPS redirects for everything except for `api.cypress.io`, which would be a breaking change. By the next minor release we will force that as well. Once we make this change we will remove all versions below `0.13.7`. So make sure you **are not** locking the Cypress version when running in CI. We periodically remove old Cypress versions which have security flaws and this is an example of one.\n\n## 0.13.6[​](#0-13-6 \"Direct link to 0.13.6\")\n\n_Released 01/09/2016_\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   All commands now retry if the associated element is disabled until the element is no longer disabled. If the command times out a specific error message is now thrown.\n*   `cy.server()` and `cy.route()` now take an optional `onAbort` callback which fires anytime an XHR is aborted.\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Fixed edge case where XHR's which were already aborted were aborted a 2nd time when tests end. Cypress now only aborts currently running XHR's which have not already been aborted.\n*   When passing an array of aliases to [`cy.wait()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/wait) there was an edge case where an incorrect error message was being thrown. The incorrect values were a combination of the wrong alias, the wrong timeout value, or the wrong request or response. Now Cypress correctly provides all 3 of these values.\n\n## 0.13.5[​](#0-13-5 \"Direct link to 0.13.5\")\n\n_Released 01/03/2016_\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   Added new command: [`cy.go()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/go) which accepts `back`, `forward`, or an arbitrary Number.\n*   [`cy.go()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/go) enables you to navigate back or forward in your history. Cypress intelligently handles situations where moving forward or back causing a full page refresh, and will wait for the new page to load before resolving and moving onto new commands. It additionally handles situations where a page load was not caused (such as hash routing) and will resolve immediately.\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   Using `{force404: false}` will now output a warning explaining this is now the default option and can be removed safely.\n\n## 0.13.4[​](#0-13-4 \"Direct link to 0.13.4\")\n\n_Released 12/31/2015_\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   Added `waitForAnimations` and `animationDistanceThreshold` [configuration options](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration#Actionability).\n*   Cypress now automatically detects and waits for an element which is animating to stop animating. The threshold that Cypress considers _animating_ is set to a distance of `5px` per `60fps`. In other words, if your element is moving too fast for a user to interact with, then Cypress considers the element animating and will wait until it finishes before attempting to interact with it. When we say 'interact' we mean apply command actions like [`.click()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/click), [`.select()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/select), [`.type()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/type), [`.check()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/check), etc. Waiting for animations prevents a series of edge cases and weird bugs where Cypress was interacting with elements **too** quickly which might cause undesired side effects in your application which are hard to track down. The downside to this implementation is that for every action Cypress must wait at least 2 run loops before applying actions. This slows down every action command by about `32ms`. If your app does not use animations you may wish to turn off this behavior in your `cypress.json` file.\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Prevent `undefined` error when attempting to [`.click()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/click) an element which is fixed position when it is covered by another element. Cypress now correctly provides why it cannot click the element in question. Fixes [#90](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/90).\n*   Prevent infinite loop in edge cases when checking whether an element was hidden.\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   The default behavior of `cy.server()` has changed from `force404: true` to become `force404: false`. In other words, Cypress will no longer forcibly send XHR's to 404 status when these XHR's do not match any existing `cy.route()`. This change better aligns with predictable usage for most Cypress users.\n\n## 0.13.3[​](#0-13-3 \"Direct link to 0.13.3\")\n\n_Released 12/25/2015_\n\n**Notes:**\n\n*   Merry Christmas everyone ;-)\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   Overhauled the entire subsystem dealing with an element's visibility state. Previously we were using jQuery's `.is(\":visible\")` selector which was ineffective at truly determining when an element is \"visible\". Our changes now differ significantly from jQuery, but they match what a real user would consider visible, and the rules are fairly easy to explain. In other words these rules should just \"make sense\".\n*   An element is considered visible if it can be \"interactive\" with a user. In other words, if the user is able to click, type, drag, or otherwise physically interact with the element it is considered visible.\n*   Because of the additional complexities of how Cypress considers an element `visible`, we now have added the **exact** reason why an element is not visible when throwing an error. This means you'll see errors detailing whether an element or its parents have `display: none`, `visibility: hidden`, or whether an element is considered hidden because its effective `width` or `height` is zero. Whatever the reason, Cypress will indicate why your element is considered hidden.\n*   Exposed `Cypress.Dom.isHidden` which holds the logic for determining an element's visibility. Modify this to change the rules.\n*   Upgraded [`.select()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/select) to automatically retry when the `<select>` is disabled, its matching `<option>` is disabled, or when Cypress cannot find a matching `<option>`. This more correctly aligns with the behavior of other actions like [`.click()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/click), which automatically retry until the element is ready to receive the action.\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Throw on [`.select()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/select) when it cannot find a matching `<option>`. Also throw when `<select>` or a matching `<option>` is disabled. Fixes [#91](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/91).\n*   \"Hidden\" elements which actually displace height or width are now highlighted when restoring the DOM when a command is hovered.\n*   Margin on zero client width / client height is now displayed correctly on command hover and more accurately mimics the way Chrome Dev Tools highlights elements.\n*   Using `history.back`, `history.forward`, or `history.go` in CI or in headless mode now works again.\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   The updated hidden rules apply to all assertions like `should(\"be.hidden\")`, and how Cypress indicates an element is hidden displays in the Command Log.\n*   Updated many error messages to be more explanatory and precise.\n*   Elements which are stringified during errors now indicate their text content (truncated to 10 characters) `<button>Save</button>` or whether they contain children elements by indicating an ellipsis `<div>...</div>`.\n*   The Routes instrument panel now displays the column: `Stubbed` instead of `Status`, which indicates whether a route is stubbing matching XHR's.\n\n## 0.13.2[​](#0-13-2 \"Direct link to 0.13.2\")\n\n_Released 12/20/2015_\n\n**Notes:**\n\n*   Docs have been updated for [`cy.wait()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/wait), `cy.route()` and `cy.server()` to reflect these changes.\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   Added `responseTimeout` [configuration](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration) value.\n*   [`cy.wait()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/wait) has been upgraded to now use two separate `timeout` values. In previous versions [`cy.wait()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/wait) used the `commandTimeout` and would automatically time out if the XHR did not achieve a response in that time frame. Now [`cy.wait()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/wait) will go through two independent timeout phases. At first [`cy.wait()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/wait) will wait for an XHR to be requested which matches its route. It will wait up to the value configured with `requestTimeout` (default 5000ms). After it sees a matching request it will then go into `response` waiting mode. It will wait up to the value configured with `responseTimeout` (default 20000ms). When [`cy.wait()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/wait) fails you now receive a much better error message indicating exactly which phase failed. Whether a request was never sent out, or whether it timed out waiting for a response. This gives you the best of both worlds and prevents situations where Cypress was timing out on slow servers. By creating new configuration values: `requestTimeout` and `responseTimeout` you can now directly control this behavior without affecting other regular commands.\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Prevent removing trailing new lines on fixtures after formatting.\n*   Added cache buster to test files which forces them to be reloaded in the `Sources` panel after making modifications. In previous versions when test files were live reloaded Chrome would not display their new contents due to a bug in Dev Tools. We've now worked around this issue.\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   Removed `{stub: false}` option from `cy.server()` and `cy.route()`. Cypress will now log a deprecation warning when you use the this option. Removing this option helps simplify the API because now Cypress can figure out whether you really want to stub the route based on whether you've provided a response or not. If you have not provided a response, the default behavior will be to not stub. If you do provide a response, Cypress will stub the route.\n*   Repurposed `requestTimeout` to now mean the time we wait for an XHR to be requested. Changed [`cy.request()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/request) to now use `responseTimeout` configuration value.\n*   Updated many error messages to be more consistent.\n*   Added special error messages when elements cannot have actions applied to them with a suggestion to use `{force: true}`.\n\n## 0.13.1[​](#0-13-1 \"Direct link to 0.13.1\")\n\n_Released 12/11/2015_\n\n**Notes:**\n\n*   We are aware of issues running in CI with Linux builds, and are working through those issues.\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Prevent headless / CI from throwing errors on `history.pushState` and `history.replaceState`.\n*   Prevent edge case where `aliasing` in the Command Log was aliasing the wrong command\n*   Prevent XHR's from throwing errors on `arraybuffer` content. Properly set `xhr.responseBody` for `XML`, `blob`, and `arraybuffer`.\n*   Headless running is now fixed in OSX. This was due to a bug with app signing + unzipping via the CLI.\n\n## 0.13.0[​](#0-13-0 \"Direct link to 0.13.0\")\n\n_Released 12/9/2015_\n\n**Summary:**\n\n*   Though it may not look like much, this upgrade was a long time in the making. There were limitations in the way we were currently handling headless / CI builds which restricted our ability to make updates or fix bugs. Additionally CI runs would randomly crash for no good reason. We decided to split out the headless / CI process into its own independent Chromium application which is now independently controlled, and is much more reliable. This upgrade enables us to handle CI features coming down the pipe and was necessary for moving forward.\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   Upgraded `Chromium` for headless and CI runs from `41` to `45`.\n*   You will now see better stack traces and errors during `cypress run` / in CI. No more `undefined is not a function` errors.\n*   Ported all links to use the new Cypress CDN.\n*   [Documentation to CLI](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line).\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   New chromium upgrade prevents synchronous XHR freezes.\n*   New chromium upgrade fixes situation where extremely long CI runs would sometimes randomly crash.\n*   Fixed problem with rewriting content on elements which contained `<svg>` elements.\n\n**Breaking Changes:**\n\n*   Temporarily ignoring the `--reporter` option for headless / CI runs. Currently it is locked to the `spec` reporter, which is the default. This will be fixed in the next few patch releases.\n*   Accessing `window.history.go()`, `window.history.back()`, `window.history.forward()` will throw an error during `cypress run` / CI. This is a regression that will be fixed - hopefully very soon. This is fixed in [`0.13.3`](#0-13-3)\n*   While this new Chromium application passes our internal tests, it may crop up other regressions we aren't aware of. If you're experiencing different behavior in CI vs running locally in Chrome, this may be an indication of these.\n\n## 0.12.8[​](#0-12-8 \"Direct link to 0.12.8\")\n\n_Released 12/2/2015_\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   There is now a new [Error Messages Page](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/error-messages) which will provide additional explanation when you are getting errors from Cypress. These errors will be directly linked to (like how Angular provides errors).\n*   Instead of hard coding external documentation, we now link everything through a redirection portal. This will prevent any links / documentation from ever breaking due to reorganization or renaming.\n*   Cypress now throws a specific error message (with a link to further explanation) if you attempt to run commands outside of a test. Usually this happens accidentally when you write `cy.commands` inside of a `describe` or `context` block instead of the `it`. I've wasted too much time and almost bombed entire presentations / demos so I've finally stopped this from ever happening again. If you ever see this error message, trust me, you will forever thank me.\n*   The error message: `Cannot call cy.method() because the current subject has been removed or detached from the DOM.` has been rewritten to provide much clearer information on why this is happening, including a string representation of your DOM element. Additionally it will have its own error page dedicated to explaining how this happens and what you can do to prevent it.\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   Rewrote error message which is displayed when Cypress cannot parse your test / spec file. Now a list of suggestions are given and an external link is provided which further explains how this may happen.\n*   Clarified the \"Default Message\" page when you have not [`cy.visit()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/visit) your application yet.\n*   Ignored `.coffee`, `.scss`, `.less` XHR's from displaying in the Command Log.\n\n## 0.12.7[​](#0-12-7 \"Direct link to 0.12.7\")\n\n_Released 11/30/2015_\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Prevent passing `{multiple: true}` incorrectly showing up in Command Log. Fixes [#88](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/88).\n*   Properly allow resource like XHR's which have query params such as jquery's `{cache: false}` option.\n*   Correctly take into account `<base>` tag on XHR's. Fixes [#89](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/89).\n\n## 0.12.6[​](#0-12-6 \"Direct link to 0.12.6\")\n\n_Released 11/29/2015_\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   There are now [Getting Started](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress) docs including [configuration](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration) for `cypress.json`\n*   Cypress now silently restarts the server whenever it detects a change to `cypress.json` - meaning you no longer have to manually reboot the server for changes to be picked up.\n*   There is a new [`Cypress.config`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/cypress-api/config) interface - akin to [`Cypress.env`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/cypress-api/env) which provides access to configuration values.\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Setup/Teardown code was not properly running on nested Mocha `before`hooks which caused the error: `The XHR server is unavailable or missing...`. Fixes [#80](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/80) and [#86](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/86).\n*   Prevent accidental mutation of `cy.server()` options when `cy.route()` was provided options. Fixes [#84](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/84) and [#85](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/85).\n*   Using [`cy.title()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/title) would incorrectly search the `<body>` for title elements, and is now restricted to only searching in the `<head>`\n*   Cross-Origin requests are now proxied by Cypress. In other words their URL's are transparently rewritten which bypasses CORS problems. This is a quick fix which should satisfy most of the problems users were having with CORS requests. However there is a much bigger change coming in `0.14.0` where the entire proxy layer will be rewritten to accommodate CORS, `window.fetch` and `domain cookies` flawlessly. As it stands Cypress is prone to errors in complex setups.\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   Exposed `visitTimeout` and `requestTimeout` [configuration](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration).\n*   Increased `visitTimeout` from `20s` to `30s`.\n*   [`.click()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/click) will now throw if you are attempting to click more than 1 element. Pass `{multiple: true}` to enable this behavior again. Each element will be clicked serially and inserted into the Command Log.\n\n## 0.12.5[​](#0-12-5 \"Direct link to 0.12.5\")\n\n_Released 11/22/2015_\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   Errors reading / writing `cypress.json` on project add are now displayed inline.\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Prevent app crashing when `cypress.json` could not be read or written to when adding a project.\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   App crashes now send a full stack trace (instead of 10 line truncation).\n*   Better error handling + error messages when trying to read / write from `cypress.json`.\n\n## 0.12.4[​](#0-12-4 \"Direct link to 0.12.4\")\n\n_Released 11/19/2015_\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   There is a new [`Cypress.Cookies`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/cypress-api/cookies) interface which enables you to `get`, `set`, and even `preserve` cookies throughout your test. Useful to preserve cookie-based sessions between your tests. [Documentation is written here](https://docs.cypress.io/api/cypress-api/cookies).\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Removed problematic `content-security-policy` headers\n*   Fixed situation where Cypress was not injected correctly when `<head>` tag had attributes\n*   Prevent fixtures from being accidentally overwritten and having their content blanked out. There was a very subtle chance due to node's async file writing that as a file was being written with a formatted fixture, that another call to the same fixture would read in at that exact moment. If this happened the 2nd read would resolve with zero bytes, which would then end up rewriting the file back with zero bytes.\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   `alerts` are automatically accepted now and a message logs to the console.\n*   Added retina favicon. Fixes [#83](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/83).\n*   Removed nested `cypress` object in the `cypress.json`. Existing `cypress.json` files are transparently rewritten on the next server boot, so you can check in the modified `cypress.json` and all will be well. Fixes [#82](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/82).\n*   Improved performance of formatting fixtures.\n\n## 0.12.3[​](#0-12-3 \"Direct link to 0.12.3\")\n\n_Released 11/04/2015_\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Prevent [`.pause()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/pause) from actually pausing during `cypress run`.\n*   Fix for [`cy.request()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/request) SSL issues when host certificates were self signed.\n\n## 0.12.2[​](#0-12-2 \"Direct link to 0.12.2\")\n\n_Released 11/01/2015_\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   There is now a `cy.cmd` and `cy.command` method which enables you to invoke commands by their string name. This is most useful when using _namespaced_ custom commands. So `Cypress.addParentCommand(\"dashboard.setSlider\", ...)` can be accessed by `cy.cmd(\"dashboard.setSlider\", arg1, arg2)`. (Docs have not been written yet).\n*   `Environment Variable` support has been added and can be accessed in your tests with [`Cypress.env`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/cypress-api/env). The docs have been written [Environment Variable](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/environment-variables) and [here](https://docs.cypress.io/api/cypress-api/env).\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   The URL property on all XHR's is now completely decoded, even on URLs which were originally encoded. The reason is for easier assertions and debugging. This URL property is specific to Cypress and does not actually affect the underlying XHR.\n\n## 0.12.1[​](#0-12-1 \"Direct link to 0.12.1\")\n\n_Released 10/28/2015_\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   `cy.route()` will no longer throw that a response is needed when using `cy.server({stub: false})`.\n*   Applying server defaults to `Cypress.Server.defaults({})` now works as documented.\n*   `onRequest` and `onResponse` can now be correctly set as permanent server defaults.\n*   XHR URL is now decoded to make assertions easier. Fixes [#75](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/75).\n\n## 0.12.0[​](#0-12-0 \"Direct link to 0.12.0\")\n\n_Released 10/23/2015_\n\n**Summary:**\n\n*   XHR handling has been rewritten to be much more flexible, extensible, and future-proof.\n\n**Breaking Changes:**\n\n*   The object you receive after waiting on an XHR alias is now different. Previously this was a `FakeXMLHttpRequest` object which came from Sinon.js. Now it is a special `XMLHttpRequest` object which comes from Cypress. You may need to rewrite some of your assertions but we've tried to keep the signatures as close as possible.\n*   The XHR's URL property will now always return you a `Fully Qualified Domain Name` including the origin, port, host, etc. Previously the URL property represented whatever the XHR was opened with. We've worked around this difference by when checking whether an XHR should be stubbed, the origin is tested both as present and omitted.\n\n**Deprecations:**\n\n*   Accessing `requestJSON` or `responseJSON` on XHR objects is deprecated, and will be removed in the next version. Accessing those properties will throw a warning which explains how to rewrite these.\n*   `cy.respond` is _temporarily_ deprecated because the semantics of how this works is completely different and will require more work (mentioned later on) before this can be re-enabled again.\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   All XHR's (regardless of whether they are stubbed or not) are now logged in the Command Log. Stubbed XHR's display as \"XHR Stub\" vs vanilla \"XHR\".\n*   Stubbed XHR's will now show up in the `Network Tab` in Dev Tools. In other words they will _really_ go out and you'll be able to inspect them just like regular XHRs.\n*   Regular XHR's can now be aliased and waited on without actually being stubbed by passing `{stub: false}` to the `cy.route()`.\n*   XHR's will continue to work correctly even _after_ a test ends. In previous versions, due to replacing the entire XHR object, your application would not work correctly after a test ended. This prevented you from \"navigating around\" and working with your app after the tests end.\n*   Servers can now be disabled in the middle of a test. Previously once a server was started all XHR's would be stubbed.\n*   You can now disable the force sending of `404` to all XHR's which are not stubbed. This allows you to mix and match, enabling some requests to be stubbed and others to hit your server and respond normally.\n*   The default XHR configuration can now be overwritten in a single area.\n*   Many new configuration options are available for controlling how XHR's are stubbed.\n*   XHR's now include an `Initiator` stack regardless of whether they're stubbed. The `Initiator` stack includes the stack which caused the XHR to be created and sent.\n*   The `onConsole` information related to an XHR has been updated to make it easier to understand why a route was or was not stubbed, and its associated request and response headers.\n*   Response headers on XHR stubs will now automatically set their `Content-Type` based on the stub response. Previously this would always set to the `Content-Type` to `application/json`. Now if you force a response to be text or html, the `Content-Type` response header will be set appropriately.\n*   You can now force other additional response headers to be sent on stubbed XHRs.\n*   XHR's now snapshot twice - when the request is made and when the response is returned.\n*   Removed sending `sinon` on every [`cy.visit()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/visit).\n*   The XHR object which is returned to you to via [`cy.wait()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/wait) is now more consistent with other return values such as [`cy.request()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/request). It should be much easier to work with `request body`, `request headers`, `response body` and `response headers`.\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Routes no longer display as duplicated in between test runs when `cy.server()` is started prior to a [`cy.visit()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/visit) and you cause a full page refresh, which caused all routes to be re-bound.\n*   Any issues related to `requestJSON` or `responseJSON` being duplicated are now fixed. Fixes [#65](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/65).\n*   Fully Qualified XHR's which should be proxied are now correctly transparently rewritten to prevent CORS problems.\n*   `cy.route()` - `onRequest` and `onResponse` callbacks are now called with `cy` as the context.\n*   Filtering assets which should never be stubbed has been improved. Now `.jsx` templates pass-through correctly.\n*   CORS Network Errors are now correctly caught.\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   All `ng` based commands now display in the Command Log.\n*   The built in XHR response delay has been removed since now all requests really go over the HTTP stack, which inherently has its own delay. You can still optionally force responses to be delayed by a set amount.\n\n**Almost there:**\n\n*   Support for the native `fetch` object.\n*   Configuration to automatically force Cypress to wait for outstanding XHR's (like it does for other Page Events). This would mean when testing more traditional apps without XHR stubbing, commands would automatically wait until all outstanding XHR's complete. The internal retry loop needs to be rewritten to make this possible, but the XHR architecture is now there.\n\n## 0.11.13[​](#0-11-13 \"Direct link to 0.11.13\")\n\n_Released 10/08/2015_\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Prevent rejected promise from causing error about invalid API key during a CI run.\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   Better error handling of rejected promises.\n\n## 0.11.12[​](#0-11-12 \"Direct link to 0.11.12\")\n\n_Released 10/07/2015_\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   Snapshots can now be named and a command can have multiple snapshots.\n*   Multiple snapshots are now cycled automatically on hover, and the name of the snapshot is displayed.\n*   Most of the action commands now take multiple snapshots (giving you a precise look at an action prior to it happening, and then afterwards).\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Fixed situation where an `Uncaught Error` was not being properly handled. Cypress would incorrectly continue to retry commands instead of canceling them, which lead to incorrect errors downstream in other tests.\n*   Fixed situation where an error being thrown from an XHR was being improperly handled (in a slightly different way than the problem above).\n*   Stopped sending CI data when [cypress run](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-run) was issued.\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   CSS Improvements\n\n## 0.11.11[​](#0-11-11 \"Direct link to 0.11.11\")\n\n_Released 10/04/2015_\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Snapshots of [`.type()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/type) and [`.select()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/select) are no longer incorrect due to taking snapshots too early. Fixes [#22](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/22).\n*   Passing `{force: true}` to [`.blur()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/blur) now logs correctly in the Command Log.\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   Added delays on some tooltips.\n*   The URL will now highlight in a yellow background during a revert DOM snapshot.\n*   Moved snapshot message to be affixed to the bottom of the remote app in preparation for cycling through multiple snapshots.\n*   Cleaned up the URL by removing some unused content.\n\n## 0.11.10[​](#0-11-10 \"Direct link to 0.11.10\")\n\n_Released 10/04/2015_\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   [`.blur()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/blur) now accepts `{force: true}` which removes error checking such as validating the element is currently in focus.\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   [`.pause()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/pause) is now noop during [cypress run](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/command-line#cypress-run) or `cypress ci`.\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   Removed `cy.inspect` command.\n*   Added Cypress logo to nav.\n*   CSS changes.\n\n## 0.11.9[​](#0-11-9 \"Direct link to 0.11.9\")\n\n_Released 10/03/2015_\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   Added `.zip` as acceptable fixture extension. Content is sent back as `base64`.\n*   Added docs to nav, consolidated `organize` into `tests`.\n*   Added favicon.\n*   Added tooltips everywhere.\n*   Created new debugging command: [`.pause()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/pause) which will pause executing commands and allow you to resume or step into the next command one at a time.\n*   You can now stop and restart tests from the UI.\n*   Added `cy.Blob` utilities for `blob` / `string` / `base64` conversion. Useful for manually handling uploads.\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   \"Cannot revert DOM while tests are running\" now removes itself correctly.\n*   Aliased DOM objects are now correctly stored on the test's `ctx` as instances of **your** jQuery (if one exists).\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   Updated UI styles / tests list / run all.\n*   Fixed alt tray icon so it shows up correctly on click.\n\n## 0.11.8[​](#0-11-8 \"Direct link to 0.11.8\")\n\n_Released 09/25/2015_\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   Added [`cy.request()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/request) command which can issue XHR requests. The request is generated outside of the browser, and bypasses all CORS restrictions. Great for talking to an API for seeding, querying, building, etc.\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Prevented edge case with [`cy.fixture()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/fixture) where it would not be able to be canceled without throwing an unhandled rejection error.\n\n## 0.11.7[​](#0-11-7 \"Direct link to 0.11.7\")\n\n_Released 09/25/2015_\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   The debug window now works again.\n*   Changed `Linux` build strategy which fixes not saving the internal `.cy cache`. Also fixes not being able to update from the GUI. Fixes [#66](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/66).\n\n## 0.11.6[​](#0-11-6 \"Direct link to 0.11.6\")\n\n_Released 09/25/2015_\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Viewport is now properly restored to the default width / height on subsequent runs. Previously it would retain the last viewport size used until there was a new viewport command.\n*   [`cy.should('contain', '...')`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/should) now correctly escapes quotes and single quotes.\n*   Assertion messages are no longer truncated, and instead will scale down by reducing the `font-size` and `line-height` after they exceed 110 characters. So you'll now always see the full assertion message.\n*   Fixed some scenarios where assertions would not be logged as a child command.\n*   Assertions based around the `window` or `document` object no longer cause Chai to bomb on formatting their object structures (due to cyclic references) and instead now will show up as `<window>` and `<document>`.\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   [`cy.window()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/window) now logs out to the `Command Log` and additionally verifies upcoming assertions.\n*   [`cy.document()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/document) now logs out to the `Command Log` and additionally verifies upcoming assertions.\n*   Removed `numElements` label on assertions which indicated the number of elements found if > 1. This was annoying and redundant since the inked command already had this number.\n\n## 0.11.5[​](#0-11-5 \"Direct link to 0.11.5\")\n\n_Released 09/20/2015_\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   The `Linux` version of Cypress now works correctly for GUI Desktop versions (tested on Ubuntu Desktop). Previously it would only worked during `cypress run` in server versions. The `tray` used in OSX does not work with the `Linux`, so in `Linux` we just use a standard window + menu.\n*   Added Desktop Icon.\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Cypress now forces the initial [`cy.visit()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/visit) not to be cached by the browser. This was incorrectly being cached which meant when you changed the [`cy.visit()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/visit) it would not actually go out and fetch the new contents. Previously you had to check `Disable Cache` in the `Network Tab` inside of Chrome to prevent this bug. Unfortunately this has a significant performance drawback. If you use a [`cy.visit()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/visit) before each test you will notice a degrade in performance because this request is no longer cached. This is a temporary problem until Cypress implements a more sophisticated caching strategy which optimizes these concerns. There is a lot to improve in this arena but it will take more time before it's implemented.\n*   [`.should()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/should) will no longer throw an error when it is used as a `parent command` and has a callback function signature, and that callback function throws outside of an assertion. Instead now it logs correctly, handles the error, and displays this error for you.\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   Many additional tests added to the multi-os deployment process.\n*   When Cypress opens other windows they are now auto-focused.\n\n## 0.11.4[​](#0-11-4 \"Direct link to 0.11.4\")\n\n_Released 09/17/2015_\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   [`.should()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/should) now accepts a callback function which will be retried until it does not throw. The callback function will be retried in the exact same way as passing regular string-based chainers to [`.should()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/should). Having a callback function gives you an opportunity to _massage_ the expected subject such as comparing multiple elements, creating an array of text or classes, etc.\n\n**Deprecations:**\n\n*   `cy.wait(function)` has been deprecated and you can safely rename this command to [`.should()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/should).\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   All of the docs surrounding [assertions](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/introduction-to-cypress#Assertions), [`.should()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/should), and [`.and()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/and) have been updated to reflect the new API.\n\n## 0.11.3[​](#0-11-3 \"Direct link to 0.11.3\")\n\n_Released 09/16/2015_\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   When XHR's are aborted Cypress will display the stack trace indicating where in your app the XHR was aborted. Additionally it will display as `(aborted)` in the Command Log.\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   XHR's will no longer be ended early and display no status as if there was no response. Fixes [#63](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/63).\n*   XHR's which are aborted no longer cause an `INVALID_STATE_ERR` to be thrown. Fixes [#62](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/62) and [#34](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/34).\n*   Cypress will no longer incorrectly revert to a previous test run's snapshot when tests are re-run.\n\n## 0.11.2[​](#0-11-2 \"Direct link to 0.11.2\")\n\n_Released 09/14/2015_\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Prevented bug where the assertion message: `expected <x> element to exist` would log over and over again when Cypress retried querying for a DOM element.\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   [`.root()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/root) now outputs its subject when clicking on its command log. Fixes [#55](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/55).\n\n## 0.11.1[​](#0-11-1 \"Direct link to 0.11.1\")\n\n_Released 09/14/2015_\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Utilizing `cy.server()` across multiple tests before a [`cy.visit()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/visit) now works correctly. As a side effect now Cypress will rebind both the `server` and all `routes` **whenever** the remote window is reloaded (for whatever reason) - even during a test itself. This means you can navigate between pages without ever having to restart the server or routes (they will automatically rebind) when the window loads. Fixes [#59](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/59).\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   Providing a \"number-string\" as in: `should(\"have.length\", \"1\")` will no longer throw an error.\n*   Internal API changes for `$Commands`.\n\n## 0.11.0[​](#0-11-0 \"Direct link to 0.11.0\")\n\n_Released 09/13/2015_\n\n**Summary:**\n\n*   This release marks a major change in the underlying algorithms used to prevent testing flake. It is a major goal of Cypress to combat and prevent **all** test flake. These algorithm changes go a long way towards making this a reality, and have been months in the making.\n*   Cypress can now predict upcoming assertions and modifies its behavior until the intended state has been reached.\n*   Command options `exist` / `visible` / `length` have been deprecated, these were confusing and limiting, and the same result can now be achieved using normal assertions. The end result is much more robust and much easier to understand.\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   Commands which precede assertions will now look downstream at those assertions and not resolve until their subject's state passes all assertions. Previously this was **sort of** implemented using _Command Options_ and the `eventually` flag, but now this is the default behavior. _Command Options_ only worked on DOM-based subjects, and now the new assertion verification works on everything else (including RL-based commands, etc). What this means is that Cypress can predict what you are requesting and automatically modifies its behavior until this state is reached. This prevents test brittleness / random test flake. Additionally this removes ever having to use [`cy.wait(Number)`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/wait) or `cy.wait(Function)` (though this is still a valid command). As a side effect, you will now see commands + their assertions in the spinning pending blue state. When assertions fail their associated command also fails at the same time. This visually represents the coupling between these two concepts. Another side effect is that `timeout` options do not need to be provided on the succeeding assertions, and can instead just be provided on the proceeding command. All of the coupled assertions will automatically be retried to the maximum `timeout` setting. Fixes [#43](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/43).\n*   Action commands will now insert an artificial delay after resolving to enable modern JavaScript frameworks time to _flush_ their run loops. snapshots are delayed until after the action, resulting in more accurate snapshots because JavaScript frameworks would not process these DOM events until `N` milliseconds after they occurred. This has the unfortunate side effect of _decreasing_ performance by about _5-10%_ but the end result is that it is much easier to debug and Cypress is less prone to flake caused by modern JavaScript frameworks. This change comes after collecting many data points and this was one of the easiest changes that help reduce flake. For users that don't use the latest and greatest JavaScript frameworks, this action delay can be reduced through `cypress.json` which may speed up large test suites.\n*   Aliasing custom commands now intelligently figures out where to apply the alias without being specified inside of the actual custom command.\n*   The algorithm for replaying aliased commands is now much more accurate, handles stale element references better, and will not replay commands which have a side effect (like action commands). The end result is Cypress will now almost always find the desired element by determining the minimum number of re-queries and is not susceptible to stale element references. Additionally using assertions on aliased elements now works (where previously using a _Command Option_ on an alias would just be ignored. This was very difficult to implement but should be 100% solid. Fixes [#36](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/36).\n*   Assertions which actually produced 2 assertions (under the hood) such as `should('have.attr', 'href', '/users/1')` will now only log the 2nd assertion, unless the first fails.\n*   Previously using `eventually.have.length` was impossible (and this would throw an error), but now this works as you'd expect with the default `should('have.length')`.\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Aliased commands now correctly output a command log again when they are replayed.\n*   Assertions that involved an `{exp}` property are no longer incorrectly substituted with the `#{this}` subject.\n*   Removed special logic for _Angular_ which tapped into its digest cycle for queueing commands. This had unpredictable results when there was n `interval` set, and is now superseded by the new queueing system anyway (which is more performant).\n*   `Sinon's` formatting of failed `spy` or `stub` calls is horrendously non-performant and would sometimes choke the CPU for several seconds. This formatting has been completely removed and will be replaced by something less outrageous later on. At the moment you can still use the built in Cypress debugging (clicking on a command log, etc) to see what the actual values were. Fixes [#18](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/18).\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   The internal retry loop of Cypress now runs at `60fps`, instead of `20fps`.\n*   Cypress overrides chai's default inspection function for DOM elements meaning instead of seeing `{ Object (0, length, ...) }` you will now see the nicely formatted Cypress DOM element like: `<button#primary.btn-large>`.\n*   Cypress now overrides chai's `match` chainer and provides a specific error message when a non `regex` value is provided. Fixes [#58](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/58).\n*   Cypress now handles `length` and `exist` assertion chainers in a very specific way, providing a detailed message on failure, and utomatically slices out any stale element references.\n*   The `contain` assertion chainer from `chai-jquery` has been extended to match the same selector logic as [`cy.contains()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/contains) - meaning it now checks the `value` of `input[type=submit]`.\n*   Tweaked the label for displaying the number of elements a command resolved with (now displays 0 differently than > 1).\n*   Removed the `eventually` flag in assertions as now this is the default behavior on normal assertions.\n*   Deprecated all _Command Options_. You will see a very nice and simple error message explaining how to convert these to assertions.\n*   [`.within()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/within) can now be silenced with `{log: false}`.\n*   Many error messages have been rewritten to be much more fluent and easier to understand.\n\n**Other News:**\n\n*   Cypress is currently seeking to raise a Series A. This will enable us to grow the team and speed up development but seeking it has come at a cost for current development speed.

Previously this would not output an error and the process would just hang.\n\n## 0.10.6[​](#0-10-6 \"Direct link to 0.10.6\")\n\n_Released 08/15/2015_\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Fixed edge case where Cypress would not correctly handle `POST` or `PUT` requests with a JSON body. These requests would just hang and eventually time out.\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   Project ID's can be programmatically set now.\n\n## 0.10.5[​](#0-10-5 \"Direct link to 0.10.5\")\n\n_Released 08/13/2015_\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Running a specific test won't open/close immediately when starting up (fixes weird flickering effect).\n*   [`.check()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/check) and [`.uncheck()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/uncheck) commands will now correctly \"end\" even if they were `noop` due to the element already being in a checked or unchecked state.\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   Currently running tests now displays a spinner to indicate they are currently running.\n*   Optimized performance of command lists.\n*   Commands which were silenced with `{log: false}` will now always display in the Command Log if they were part of a replayed chain of commands due to an alias reference becoming stale. Previously they would not display which was very confusing.\n*   Sinon.JS is no longer minified.\n\n## 0.10.4[​](#0-10-4 \"Direct link to 0.10.4\")\n\n_Released 08/11/2015_\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   The OSX Cypress App was not being properly signed (since 0.10.0) due to an oversight in our deployment process. This has been fixed now and additional checks have been added to ensure the deployed version is properly signed. Updating within the app was unaffected. This bug only effected fresh downloads from the internet.\n*   Errors / crashes encountered when updating to newer versions through the app should be fixed now.\n\n## 0.10.3[​](#0-10-3 \"Direct link to 0.10.3\")\n\n_Released 08/10/2015_\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Cypress Errors in `hooks` (`beforeEach`, etc) will no longer cause Mocha to fire its `end` event thus ending the entire run. In CI, this would cause the test suite to end early. Uncaught Mocha errors will however continue this behavior. Cypress does not yet have a \"skipped\" visual state for tests which were skipped, so at the moment it may look a little strange and unpredictable.\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   Tweaked clicking algorithm to re-verify an elements visibility anytime the click retries its `retry` logic. Previously this check only happened once at the beginning of the click.\n*   In CI, the window size (not the viewport) has been changed from `1024x768` to `1280x720`. This will only affect `screenshot` artifacts which are taken automatically with [`cy.screenshot()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/screenshot) (coming soon) or whenever a test fails (also coming soon).\n\n## 0.10.2[​](#0-10-2 \"Direct link to 0.10.2\")\n\n_Released 08/10/2015_\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Memory optimizations in CI.\n*   Reduce noise in logs.\n*   Prevented external `NODE_ENV` mutations causing problems in CI.\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   Better error tracing.\n\n## 0.10.1[​](#0-10-1 \"Direct link to 0.10.1\")\n\n_Released 08/07/2015_\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Fixed missing dependency for CI.\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   Cypress now logs out your project's API key on a failed CI run.\n\n## 0.10.0[​](#0-10-0 \"Direct link to 0.10.0\")\n\n_Released 08/06/2015_\n\n**Summary:**\n\n*   Cypress is now able to run all the tests, run in the terminal, and includes support for Linux and CI. Additionally, most of the functionality of he GUI Desktop App can now be accessed through command line arguments.\n*   Because each operating system requires a specific build of Cypress - a new CLI tool has been created which abstracts away these differences and orchestrates the Desktop App regardless of which OS you are running.\n*   This [CLI tool is now published on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cypress), though the documentation still needs to be written.\n*   There is now a download service to access the latest version of Cypress and previous versions.\n*   Cypress aims not only to make it easier to write tests, but after you build a test harness, it will make it easier to dive into failed tests (hat run in CI). This release paves the way for providing after-run results and allowing you to dive into those failures.\n\n**Breaking Changes:**\n\n*   Due to security upgrades, adding projects in previous versions will no longer work. Upgrade and everything should be okay.\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   The latest version of Cypress can be downloaded here: [http://download.cypress.io/latest](http://download.cypress.io/latest).\n*   Cypress can alternatively be downloaded / installed / managed through the CLI utility.\n*   Cypress can now be run through the terminal.\n*   You can now run all of your tests inside of the GUI App.\n*   You can use the CLI tool to run Cypress in CI. The documentation for this needs to be written, but it will be very simple to do. You will probably only have to write 2 lines in your CI scripts to run Cypress.\n*   You can configure CI to use any reporter built into Mocha, and additionally we are adding JUnit XML output (for Jenkins) as a built in default.\n*   You can write your own custom reporter which Cypress can use in CI.\n*   Console output from your apps is suppressed while running in the terminal.\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Several security problems with projects have been closed in preparation for running in CI.\n*   Extensive memory profiling has been done and Cypress has implemented several strategies for aggressively causing garbage collection. The debugging tools (which allow you to walk back in time through DOM snapshots, or access objects from previous tests) could exhaust all available memory in previous versions. This likely never affected most users, but if a user ran 1000's of tests (which have been written in Cypress) it would bomb. Now Cypress only stores data for up to 50 tests, and will begin purging data past that. When run in the terminal, Cypress doesn't apply any of its debugging tools, so CI will be unaffected.\n*   Several instances of memory leaks were plugged up.\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   Everything except for the `cypress driver` is now minified.\n*   Some users have reported problems upgrading previous versions. This is because we changed the name from \"cypress\" to \"Cypress\" including some binaries. If your upgrade does not finish you can redownload the latest version of Cypress or use the CLI tool to reinstall it.\n*   Our build and testing processes have been upgraded to accommodate Linux builds.\n*   Sinon.JS object formatting during errors has been suppressed (when using spies/stubs) due to its horrendous performance when comparing deeply nested objects. This means you won't see the (mostly) useless error output from Sinon, but given Cypress debugging tools you can still inspect objects and figure out what went wrong.\n\n## 0.9.6[​](#0-9-6 \"Direct link to 0.9.6\")\n\n_Released 07/27/2015_\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Fixed server crash on improperly handled proxy error.\n*   Upgraded logic to redirect back to the Cypress client app on manual URL changes.\n\n## 0.9.5[​](#0-9-5 \"Direct link to 0.9.5\")\n\n_Released 07/14/2015_\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   [`.click()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/click), [`.type()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/type), [`.clear()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/clear), [`.select()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/select), [`.check()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/check), [`.uncheck()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/uncheck) now will wait for the subject to automatically become visible instead of throwing immediately if the element is not in a visible state.\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   Swapped out ugly nonsense `refresh` icon to `square-o` to represent a test which has not run yet.\n\n## 0.9.4[​](#0-9-4 \"Direct link to 0.9.4\")\n\n_Released 07/06/2015_\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   [`cy.contains()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/contains), [`cy.get()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/get), and `traversal commands` will now all log out heir last known `$el` on failure. This means the `$el` will be highlight during Command Log hovering, and will display in the console on click. his should make debugging failed DOM based commands much easier. Fixes [#52](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/52).\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Fixed edge case with [`cy.contains()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/contains) and command options `visible` and `exist` where it would always fail even though the matched element was in the correct state.\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   [`cy.contains()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/contains) now throws when provided the command option: `length` because it will only ever return 1 element.\n\n## 0.9.3[​](#0-9-3 \"Direct link to 0.9.3\")\n\n_Released 07/06/2015_\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   Proxied jQuery: `$` onto `cy` as `cy.$` and specific class methods: `Event`, `Deferred`, `ajax`, `get`, `getJSON`, `getScript`, `post`.\n*   Proxied `moment` onto `cy` as `cy.moment`.\n*   The URL will now automatically be restored when hovering over the Command Log to indicate the state of the URL at the time the command ran.\n*   [`.click()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/click) now accepts an optional: `position` argument (`center`, `topLeft`, `topRight`, `bottomLeft`, `bottomRight`). Center is still the default.\n*   [`.click()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/click) now accepts an optional `x` and `y` coordinate argument, which is relative to the top left corner of the element. Fixes [#50](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/50).\n*   [Click docs have been updated](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/click) to reflect these changes.\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   `onBeforeLoad` and `onLoad` callbacks to [`cy.visit()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/visit) are now invoked with `cy` as the context.\n*   Cypress logo now displays in `About Page`.\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   Internal refactoring to `Cypress.Mouse`.\n\n## 0.9.2[​](#0-9-2 \"Direct link to 0.9.2\")\n\n_Released 07/04/2015_\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   Added `About` page in desktop application annotating the current version.\n*   [`cy.fixture()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/fixture) now supports these additional extensions: `.html`, `.txt`, `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.gif`, `.tif`, `.tiff`.\n*   Image fixtures will be sent back as a `base64` string.\n*   HTML fixtures will be prettified and saved back over the original.\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   Added more tests around various areas of the desktop application and ID generator.\n\n## 0.9.1[​](#0-9-1 \"Direct link to 0.9.1\")\n\n_Released 07/03/2015_\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   [`cy.viewport()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/viewport) can now accept an `orientation` when providing a `preset`. Valid orientations are `landscape` and `portrait`.\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   The scaffolded `spec_helper.js` now correctly returns its object literal in the `onConsole` callback.\n*   [`.type()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/type) now correctly logs its message to the Command Log when provided options.\n*   [`.type()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/type) has been upgraded to handle situations where as it's typing, 3rd party code mutates the value either synchronously or asynchronously. The caret is automatically moved to the end position matching browser behavior.\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   Deprecated `Cypress.command`, instead use `Cypress.Log.command` to output a Command Log. Updated scaffolding on new projects to reflect this change.\n*   [`cy.contains()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/contains) now outputs much more explicit error messages when given command options. Fixes [#49](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/49).\n*   `cy.route()` no longer validates `response` value when `{respond: false}` is passed in as options. Fixes [#48](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/48).\n*   [`.invoke()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/invoke) and [`.its()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/its) will now log out the $el if it's a DOM object, which will now correctly highlight the $el during a command revert. Additionally if these commands have been called on a DOM object, their `onConsole` message will include the DOM objects.\n\n## 0.9.0[​](#0-9-0 \"Direct link to 0.9.0\")\n\n_Released 07/02/2015_\n\n**Summary:**\n\n*   [`cy.viewport()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/viewport) is a new command which will resize the viewport to a specified width and height. There is ow a default `viewport` size of `1000x660`.\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   Your application's viewport dimensions will now automatically scale to fit regardless of your screen's size. This enables you to test resolutions larger than what your screen is capable of displaying. Additionally this fixes edge cases caused when there was a difference in viewports between users.\n*   The viewport's dimensions will now dynamically display accurately as they are changed in the header area.\n*   The viewport's scale will now dynamically display accurately as it is changed.\n*   Each command will automatically restore the viewport to the dimensions at the time the command was issued. In other words, scrolling over each command will restore exactly what Cypress \"saw\" when it issued the command.\n*   Several common viewport presets have been added for convenience\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   Cypress now requires a viewport to be issued at all times. By default it is `1000x660` but can be changed in your `cypress.json` file with he keys: `viewportWidth` and `viewportHeight`.\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Scrollbar styling is no longer hijacked by Cypress.\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   Updated remote application iframe styles.\n\n## 0.8.1[​](#0-8-1 \"Direct link to 0.8.1\")\n\n_Released 06/30/2015_\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   [`.select()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/select) will now fire a `focus` event on the `<select>` even if the window isn't in focus.\n*   [`.click()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/click) has been upgraded to be more intelligent about firing `focus` events, and now takes into account the previously focused element.\n*   [`.type()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/type) and [`.clear()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/clear) will not issue `change` events or `focus` events unnecessary when chaining together multiple actions which do not change the element or cause it to lose focus. Fixes [#47](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/47).\n\n## 0.8.0[​](#0-8-0 \"Direct link to 0.8.0\")\n\n_Released 06/26/2015_\n\n**Summary:**\n\n*   [`.type()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/type) now implements all DOM events to simulate every aspect of typing on a real keyboard.\n*   All of the [type docs have been updated](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/type) to reflect these changes.\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   [`.type()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/type) now outputs \"Key Events Table\" which is a `console.table` of every key typed, the `charCode`, all vents that fired, and whether any were `preventedDefault`.\n*   [`.type()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/type) now accepts the following special character sequences: `{selectall}`, `{del}`, `{backspace}`, `{esc}`, `{{}`, `{enter}`, `{leftarrow}`, `{rightarrow}`.\n*   [`.type()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/type) implements `cursor` and `selection` and `range` accurately like a real keyboard.\n*   [`.type()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/type) now fires change events exactly like real browsers when `{enter}` is used.\n*   [`.type()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/type) will fire `textInput` and `input` events exactly like a real browser. Fixes [#7](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7).\n*   [`.type()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/type) now follows all of the spec in regards to `preventingDefault` on any event that would insert a character such as `keydown`, `keypress`, `textInput`.\n*   [`.type()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/type) events should be `100%` identical to real browser `KeyboardEvents` including `charCode`, `which`, `keyCode`, `data`, etc.\n*   [`.type()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/type) now inserts a small delay `10ms` between each keystroke to simulate a real user typing.\n*   `input` events are now correctly fired when [`.select()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/select) chooses an `<option>`.\n*   `change` events are now fired exactly how a browser does (when an input loses focus and its value has changed since its last focus event). You'll see these fire after you use [`.blur()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/blur) directly, or use another `action command` on another element.\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Using [`.type()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/type) in an `input[type=number]` will no longer prepend the value. Fixes [#26](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/26).\n*   `[contenteditable]` elements can now be focused and blurred.\n*   `aborting` during [`.click()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/click) / [`.dblclick()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/dblclick) now correctly cancels remaining queued click/dblclick events.\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   `console.groups` are now collapsed by default.\n*   [`.type()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/type) now validates the chars and will throw on anything other than a string or finite number.\n*   [`.type()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/type) now throws on empty strings.\n*   Removed several libs that used to handle typing simulation and rewrote typing from scratch.\n\n## 0.7.6[​](#0-7-6 \"Direct link to 0.7.6\")\n\n_Released 06/23/2015_\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Prevent infinite loop due to a trifecta of rare circumstances with [`.click()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/click). Clicking will now retry sync after it attempts to scroll past the element covering up the desired clickable element. Fixes [#46](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/46).\n\n## 0.7.5[​](#0-7-5 \"Direct link to 0.7.5\")\n\n_Released 06/19/2015_\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   [`.click()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/click) now takes into account being covered by a fixed positioned element and will increase the window's scroll offset to account for this. There are still more improvements to be made before this is bulletproof though.\n*   [`cy.contains()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/contains) could potentially resolve to a null subject if the matching content was split across multiple nested children elements. This has been fixed and contains will now return the first, deepest element which contains text potentially spread over multiple text nodes and/or children elements.\n\n## 0.7.4[​](#0-7-4 \"Direct link to 0.7.4\")\n\n_Released 06/18/2015_\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   Attempting to [`.click()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/click) a select element will now throw an error. The error guides you to using the [`.select()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/select) command, as that is the command you should use to change a `<select>` value.\n*   `cy.route()` responses are now validated. If responses are `null` or `undefined` Cypress will throw a very specific error message.\n*   Cypress will now display `cypress.json` parse errors when attempting to boot a project when there is a syntax error in `cypress.json`.\n\n## 0.7.3[​](#0-7-3 \"Direct link to 0.7.3\")\n\n_Released 06/17/2015_\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   [`.select()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/select) will now output a command log.\n*   [`.select()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/select) will now have `click` / `focus` events fired on itself and the selected options (as per the pec).\n*   [`.select()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/select) is now inline with the other `Action` commands and will retry until the element naturally becomes selectable.\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   `Action` command options are now properly formatted, instead of saying `Object{4}` they will display the overridden default options - ie: `force`, `timeout`, `interval`.\n*   Sending `{force: true}` to `Action` commands will no longer error out if the element is not visible. Forcing the action to take place now correctly removes all error checking prior to issuing the action and events.\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   Removed stack traces on `AssertionErrors` in the console since those come from `chai` and are basically useless.\n\n## 0.7.2[​](#0-7-2 \"Direct link to 0.7.2\")\n\n_Released 06/17/2015_\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Removed factoring in the total time a test has been running when determining when its command timeout. This fixes a bug where commands down he chain would timeout earlier than their specified `{timeout: num}` option.\n\n## 0.7.1[​](#0-7-1 \"Direct link to 0.7.1\")\n\n_Released 06/16/2015_\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   DOM commands which can retry now correctly support `{timeout: num}` options which will raise the timeout beyond the standard `commandTimeout` rom `cypress.json`.\n*   `<script>`, `<img>`, `<video>` commands or any other element which supports `crossorigin` attribute now are proxied correctly. The `crossorigin` attribute removes sending cookies with the HTTP request and now there is a fallback to figure out the `remoteHost` even in this situation.\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   Support for redirects with status code `303`.\n\n## 0.7.0[​](#0-7-0 \"Direct link to 0.7.0\")\n\n_Released 06/15/2015_\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   Cypress now has first class support for `fixtures` (official docs coming soon).\n*   Introduced new [`cy.fixture()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/fixture) command.\n*   Fixtures support `json`, `js`, and `coffee` files with image support coming soon.\n*   Fixtures are automatically validated, with error messages propagating up to the client.\n*   Fixtures are automatically formatted / indented for easy debugging.\n*   Example fixture is automatically created with every project.\n*   Example support files are now automatically created with every project.\n*   `cy.route()` now accepts an **alias** as its response.\n*   `cy.route()` additionally accepts a special `fixture:` or `fx:` keyword which automatically loads the fixture as the response.\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Clicking giant yellow CypressError now displays associated XHR error in the console.\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   RegExp arguments are now properly formatted in the Command Log.\n*   Update `bluebird` to `2.9.27`.\n*   Update `glob` to `5.0.10`.\n\n## 0.6.14[​](#0-6-14 \"Direct link to 0.6.14\")\n\n_Released 06/11/2015_\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   Command logging has been upgraded to support \"page events\", which are different than commands. Now events which happen (XHR/page load/url change/spies/stubs/mocks) log out visually differently and do not use a command number. This should be easier to parse what was a real command and what was a page event.\n*   When the url changes this is now logged as a page event, and its `onConsole` logs what caused it to change.\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   Internal refactor / improvements to support long lived runnable objects to work with page events.\n*   Request Commands (now page events) have now been renamed to 'XHR'.\n*   [`cy.document()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/document) now returns the raw document object instead of a jQuery wrapped document object.\n*   When [`.its()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/its) or [`.invoke()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/invoke) fails it will include the current subject n the `onConsole` log.\n*   [`cy.wait()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/wait) now logs out when its referenced aliases, and its `onConsole` output displays the XHR return values.\n*   [`cy.hash()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/hash) and [`cy.url()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/url) no longer pass the return value as the command log's `message`, which made no sense and was unlike every other command.\n\n## 0.6.13[​](#0-6-13 \"Direct link to 0.6.13\")\n\n_Released 06/09/2015_\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Traversal methods now correctly return their `$el` even when `{log: false}` option is passed.\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   [`.type()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/type) now works with `contenteditable` attributes.\n\n## 0.6.12[​](#0-6-12 \"Direct link to 0.6.12\")\n\n_Released 06/09/2015_\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   When Cypress detects a `page loading` event it will now clear out the subject so the next commands cannot reference previous page DOM elements.\n*   [`.check()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/check) and [`.uncheck()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/uncheck) will no longer output additional error'd commands when their associated `click` fails.\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   [`.type()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/type), [`.clear()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/clear), [`.check()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/check), [`.uncheck()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/uncheck) now all take `{force: true}` options to force the click to happen and skip additional clickable checks.\n*   Now when you click the giant yellow failure messages if the error is a `CypressError` instead of logging nothing it will now find the command associated to that error and display the same message as if you clicked the failed command.\n\n## 0.6.11[​](#0-6-11 \"Direct link to 0.6.11\")\n\n_Released 06/08/2015_\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   [`.clear()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/clear) and [`.type()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/type) no longer output additional error'd commands hen their associated `click` fails.\n*   Changed scrolling elements into view to use top strategy instead of bottom which fixes times where the middle of an element was not yet in he viewport. Fixes [#42](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/42).\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   [`.submit()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/submit) now errors if it's been called on >1 form element. Fixes [#41](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/41).\n*   Coordinates and hitboxes are now logged and displayed on [`.clear()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/clear) and [`.type()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/type).\n\n## 0.6.10[​](#0-6-10 \"Direct link to 0.6.10\")\n\n_Released 06/06/2015_\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Improved clicking algorithm to reduce edge cases where element could not be clicked but should have been able to be clicked.\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   [`.click()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/click) accepts `{force: true}` which will force it to issue the click event and bypass checking to ensure element is physically clickable.\n*   Elements which are children of a container with `overflow` are automatically scrolled prior to a click (which is an abstraction around real user behavior).\n*   Elements that are covering up an element you targeted for [`.click()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/click) are now logged out in the command console.\n*   All elements are now logged out as real DOM elements instead of jQuery wrapped elements. This has several upsides. Chrome will allow you to immediately interact with these elements, drilling into their contents, displaying the element box model on hover, etc. This prevents you from having to expand the jQuery elements and click \"Reveal in Elements Panel\".\n\n## 0.6.9[​](#0-6-9 \"Direct link to 0.6.9\")\n\n_Released 06/06/2015_\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Custom commands no longer error out if they are the very first `cy` command.\n\n## 0.6.8[​](#0-6-8 \"Direct link to 0.6.8\")\n\n_Released 06/05/2015_\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   [`cy.clearCookie()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/clearcookie) and [`cy.clearCookies()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/clearcookies) have been added as new commands.\n*   Cypress will automatically clear all cookies **before** each test run.\n*   Named the spec + app iframe so that inside of Chrome Dev Tools the iframe selector will clearly distinguish which iframe is your application versus Cypress.\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Hitbox is no longer covered up by element layers on DOM revert.\n*   Finally tracked down and fixed edge case causing empty view to display when tests were not empty. Fixes [#13](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/13)\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   [`cy.visit()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/visit) now accepts `{log: false}` to prevent logging out (useful in custom commands).\n*   [`cy.contains()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/contains) is now scoped by default to the `<body>` instead of `document` which prevents it from returning elements in the `head` like `title`.\n\n## 0.6.7[​](#0-6-7 \"Direct link to 0.6.7\")\n\n_Released 06/04/2015_\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   When reverting the DOM, associated command elements are now automatically scrolled into view.\n*   Hitboxes are now displayed on the screen based on the actual coordinates where an `action command` event took place.\n*   Click events now display event information about the `mousedown` / `mouseup` / `click` default action + propagation in the command console.\n*   Preventing default action on `mousedown` will no longer give focus as per the spec.\n*   Click events are now issued in the exact center of an element (taking into account 2d transforms) and provide the coordinates in the command console and in the actual event\n*   Click events now take into account whether the associated element is being covered up by another element, and will retry or fail with an exact error message if the click was unable to be issued due to this reason.\n*   Click events will now intelligently provide `focus` to the first focusable element on the stack at the click coordinates, or will give `focus` to the window.\n*   Click events will issue the click to the topmost element based on the click coordinates and not necessarily to the element you requested to e clicked (which simulates exactly how a real click works). If this happens it is noted in the command console and provides the `Actual Element Clicked`.\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   When hover over commands element layers (2d transforms like rotation) are now taken into account and displayed correctly.\n*   There was a bug when checking / unchecking `:checkbox` where it did not properly receive focus.\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   Click events are now replicated _almost_ identically to the W3C click spec. They should behave for all intents and purposes, identically to real clicks in the browser.\n\n## 0.6.6[​](#0-6-6 \"Direct link to 0.6.6\")\n\n_Released 05/31/2015_\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Fixed regression related to [`cy.visit()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/visit) not re-visiting when current match matches remote url.\n\n## 0.6.5[​](#0-6-5 \"Direct link to 0.6.5\")\n\n_Released 05/23/2015_\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   When Cypress detects a regular HTTP page loading event (where we're leaving the current page and requesting a new one) it will now insert a `loading` command which indicates to the user Cypress has stopped running commands until the new page loads.\n*   If for some reason this new page errors Cypress will display the initial 500 error messages just like [`cy.visit()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/visit).\n*   Cypress now waits `20s` (which matches [`cy.visit()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/visit)) for the new page to load instead of `4s` previously.\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   [`.submit()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/submit) will actually submit the form for real now, instead of just firing the submit event. Now it's been upgraded to be able to be canceled or have its returnValue set to false and will not submit the form. Don't ask how I missed this one. I as once a young naive programmer who trusted the DOM not to be the abomination it actually is.\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   No longer send back a 500 message when initial response status code is 4xx.\n\n## 0.6.4[​](#0-6-4 \"Direct link to 0.6.4\")\n\n_Released 05/21/2015_\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Host header HTTPS protocol handling fixed.\n*   Incorrectly handling query params on redirects fixed.\n*   Other header edge cases fixed.\n\n## 0.6.3[​](#0-6-3 \"Direct link to 0.6.3\")\n\n_Released 05/20/2015_\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   Cypress should work with self signed SSL certificates now.\n\n## 0.6.2[​](#0-6-2 \"Direct link to 0.6.2\")\n\n_Released 05/20/2015_\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Using the `length` option in `querying` or `traversal` commands now logs out in the Command Log. Fixes [#40](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/40).\n*   Other scenarios are fixed where command options would show incorrect number of object keys due to a bug in underscore's `reduce` with an object that has a `length` key. Fixes [#35](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/35).\n\n## 0.6.1[​](#0-6-1 \"Direct link to 0.6.1\")\n\n_Released 05/15/2015_\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Using the `length` option in traversal commands works properly now. Fixes [#38](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/38).\n*   Command logging now works even if no `cy` commands have been issued. Fixes [#37](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/37).\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   Removed cy proxy commands: `each`, `map`. These didn't really \"fit\" into the concept of a command, and with [`.invoke()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/invoke) or [`.its()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/its) they're accessible anyway, so nothing is really lost.\n\n## 0.6.0[​](#0-6-0 \"Direct link to 0.6.0\")\n\n_Released 05/14/2015_\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   Pushstate application routing now works 100% reliably with NO hacky overrides in all browsers.\n*   All incompatible `a` / `link` / `form` elements are transparently rewritten to be compatible including FQDN and protocol-less `href` / `src`.\n*   Cookies are automatically cleared between page refreshes, during app startup, and leaving the test page.\n*   3rd Party cookies are now additionally cleared. All cookies are now accessible to the client in preparation for [`cy.clearCookies()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/clearcookies).\n*   Manual navigation after tests run now works reliably.\n*   Navigating between full page refreshes during tests now works reliably.\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Server-side redirects are now completely transparently handled and supported.\n*   URLs are no longer altered in any weird way.\n*   Problematic `headers` are now automatically stripped from remote responses.\n*   3rd party `headers` are now properly proxied onto all responses.\n*   Custom headers and other headers \"of interest\" are rewritten for transparent compatibility.\n*   `gzip` compression now handled and proxied correctly.\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   Completely overhauled the URL and proxy system used to serve remote applications.\n*   Drastically simplified the architecture required for proxying.\n*   Improved reliability for displaying the remote url.\n*   Namespaced all cypress internal routes.\n*   Many internal development / debugging processes improved.\n*   Added 100+ new tests surrounding serving remote content and processing requests.\n*   Renamed all remaining old references to `eclectus`.\n*   All responses are now streamed using `content-encoding: chunked`.\n\n## 0.5.15[​](#0-5-15 \"Direct link to 0.5.15\")\n\n_Released 05/07/2015_\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Reverted `window.location` overrides. This broke things in unexpected ways and after further testing would not have worked on `Firefox` and `IE`. It's back to the drawing board (but I have some ideas). Apps using `pushState` routing are broken again.\n\n## 0.5.14[​](#0-5-14 \"Direct link to 0.5.14\")\n\n_Released 05/06/2015_\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   Cypress now works with JS applications that use `pushState` and `replaceState` routing (commonly known as `HTML5 History`) without having to change any application code.\n*   Cypress now always updates the remote URL whenever your application changes its URL through the vast variety of ways it can do this.\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Removed `iframe` and `link[rel=stylesheet]` elements during DOM revert.\n*   Server instrument now correctly displays the number of responses their corresponding routes have had.\n*   Spies/Stubs/Mocks instrument now correctly displays the number of calls their corresponding methods have had.\n*   When users navigate between pages with commands, like [`.click()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/click), Cypress now correctly waits until the age has finished loading before running more commands. Previously this waited for the `unload` event, which did not fire synchronously, and ow we bind to `beforeunload` which does. Additionally Cypress checks to ensure `beforeunload` did not return a non-undefined value.\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   More changes to prepare for server adapters,\n\n## 0.5.13[​](#0-5-13 \"Direct link to 0.5.13\")\n\n_Released 05/04/2015_\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   New `cy.message` and `cy.msg` commands in preparation for `cypress-ruby`, `cypress-node`, `cypress-*` packages/gem to talk directly to your back end.\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Using `querying` or `traversal` commands will no longer throw a 2nd command error when using improper sizzle selectors.\n*   Argument formatting display for command messages is fixed. There were instances of leading commas, or no commas on some commands.\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   Changed default port from `3000` to `2020` to avoid standard port conflicts with commonly used back ends. Afterall, using Cypress is testing with 2020 vision. ;-)\n*   Updated `bluebird` to `2.9.25`.\n*   Began implementation in preparation for **cross browser testing** coming sometime relatively soon.\n\n## 0.5.12[​](#0-5-12 \"Direct link to 0.5.12\")\n\n_Released 04/30/2015_\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   Introduced new **command option** `length` which cues Cypress into not resolving matched elements until their length matches the option provided.\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   `cy.respond` will not resolve until all of the queue'd XHR's have resolved.\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   Cypress now throws on [`.should()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/should) if any DOM member isn't in the DOM, except for `exist` assertions.\n*   Cypress now throws on `eventually.have.length` assertions. Use implicit `{length: n}` command options instead.\n*   Cypress overrides chai `exist` assertion to really mean: \"does this subject exist in the document?\"\n\n## 0.5.11[​](#0-5-11 \"Direct link to 0.5.11\")\n\n_Released 04/29/2015_\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Fixed missing `aliasType` from primitives and some DOM aliases, which prevent the background color from displaying in the UI.\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   Optimized performance for hovering / exiting commands. Heavily reduced the CPU on revert / restore the DOM.\n\n## 0.5.10[​](#0-5-10 \"Direct link to 0.5.10\")\n\n_Released 04/28/2015_\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   `cy.server()` now accepts a `delay` option which will delay all responses to requests (including 404) based on the value in ms\n*   `cy.server()` now accepts a `respond` option which can turn off automatic responding to requests.\n*   `cy.route()` now accepts a `delay` option which overrides the delay option set in `cy.server()` to just matched requests.\n*   `cy.route()` now accepts a `respond` option which will turn off automatic responding to just matched requests.\n*   Fixes [#14](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/14).\n*   [`cy.wait()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/wait) now accepts an alias property called `request`. Example: `cy.wait('@getUsers.request')` which ill resolve once the XHR is initially requested, before it is responded to. This allows you to test things when a request is in flight.\n*   Added `cy.respond` command which will respond to all pending requests when `{respond: false}` is set in the `server` or `route`.\n*   [`.debug()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/debug) now displays pending requests and completed requests.\n*   The command UI now displays pending requests as a `pending command`.\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   Updated `sinon` to `1.14.1`.\n\n## 0.5.9[​](#0-5-9 \"Direct link to 0.5.9\")\n\n_Released 04/26/2015_\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   Added [`.spread()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/spread) method which spreads an array as individual arguments to a callback function,like [`.then()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/then).\n*   During an update Cypress will now display the updating message in the same coordinates as when the app was open by clicking the tray icon.\n*   After an update Cypress will now open back up and show itself in these same coordinates.\n*   [`cy.wait()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/wait) can now accept an array of route aliases which will wait until all have completed. This array of resolved XHRs will become the next subject.\n*   Each time an alias in used with a [`cy.wait()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/wait), Cypress will not resolve until the Nth request matching the outing alias responds. Fixes [#4](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/4).\n*   [`cy.get()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/get) has been upgraded to accept a routing alias. By default it will yield the last matched request, but also supports special alias properties which return a different request or potentially an array of requests.\n\n## 0.5.8[​](#0-5-8 \"Direct link to 0.5.8\")\n\n_Released 04/24/2015_\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   [`.as()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/as) can now alias primitives and objects other than routes or DOM.\n*   [`.as()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/as) automatically assigns this alias to `runnable.ctx` which makes it available synchronously.\n*   [`.as()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/as) does not allow several reserved words and will throw if you attempt to alias as one of them.\n*   [`cy.get()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/get) can now accept all alias types and will display the labels in the UI differently based on the alias type.\n*   Cypress now displays a message when the Desktop App update is actually being applied instead of doing nothing and looking like it's crashed.\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   [`.as()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/as) now throws on empty strings or non string arguments.\n*   Desktop App debug logs no longer sort in the wrong direction.\n*   Permissions are now restored during a cypress update for the `logs` and `cache`.\n*   Prevent 3rd party windows from gaining focus over main window.\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   Removed `cy.assign`, this has been folded into [`.as()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/as).\n*   Updated `chokidar` to `1.0.1`.\n\n## 0.5.7[​](#0-5-7 \"Direct link to 0.5.7\")\n\n_Released 04/23/2015_\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   The insanity that is URL parsing to figure out absolute, relative, absolute-path-relative, http, sub domains, and local files should work in most cases. In other words, Cypress has implemented the vast majority of url parsing based on the [w3c URL spec](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/).\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Prevent reverting the DOM while tests are running. Fixes [#28](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/28).\n*   Fix edge case with forced focusing / blurring an element when document is not in focus and the element is no longer in the DOM.\n*   Visiting relative paths which are served from your file system works again.\n*   Visiting absolute paths in the iframe now displays the correct URL in the address bar again.\n\n## 0.5.6[​](#0-5-6 \"Direct link to 0.5.6\")\n\n_Released 04/22/2015_\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   Cypress now detects the difference between a forced async `done` test timeout vs a regular command timeout, and will throw the appropriate message indicating whether the user forgot to invoke `done` or whether the timeout happened due to a command.\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   [`cy.visit()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/visit) now properly times out when the `load` event does not occur within the time out window.\n*   If a page loads after a [`cy.visit()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/visit) times out it will no longer cause an exception in the `onBeforeLoad` handler.\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   Increased [`cy.visit()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/visit) timeout from **15s** to **20s**.\n*   [`cy.visit()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/visit) now throws a custom error message when it times out (instead of an incorrect / confusing default Mocha timeout message).\n*   Using a `debugger` while running a test will no longer always cause the test to time out (yay!).\n*   Override default Mocha timeout handling, replaced with custom logic. Removes many bizarre edge cases.\n\n## 0.5.5[​](#0-5-5 \"Direct link to 0.5.5\")\n\n_Released 04/20/2015_\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   When main app window comes into focus, it will automatically focus other peripheral windows.\n*   Added explicit error message when using child commands on a subject which has been detached or removed from the DOM.\n*   Cypress now detects when an async test is passed and not all commands have finished running. It will throw an explicit error message in this situation.\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   Error messages no longer break within words.\n\n## 0.5.4[​](#0-5-4 \"Direct link to 0.5.4\")\n\n_Released 04/20/2015_\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   Enhanced [`.should()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/should) to accept `eventually` flag to automatically retry assertions until timeout is reached.\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   Repurposed [`.and()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/and) to be an alias of [`.should()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/should) for chainability.\n*   Removed `cy.to`.\n\n## 0.5.3[​](#0-5-3 \"Direct link to 0.5.3\")\n\n_Released 04/19/2015_\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Handle relative path segments which walk up past the remote host `../../assets/app.css`.\n*   Throw explicit error for `null`, `undefined`, and `\"\"` arguments to [`cy.contains()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/contains). Fixes [#24](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/24).\n\nMisc\n\n*   Improved `onConsole` message for [`cy.focused()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/focused) when no element was returned.

The server and routes will apply to the next page which is visited. This allows you to stub requests which happen on page load. Suggested in [#17](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/17).\n*   [`cy.visit()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/visit) now takes an optional `onBeforeLoad` callback option which is invoked when your page begins to ender but prior to its load event.\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   Improved error message when attempting to use `cy.agents` or anything else which requires a remote sandbox. Fixes [#12](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/12).\n\n## 0.4.2[​](#0-4-2 \"Direct link to 0.4.2\")\n\n_Released 04/09/2015_\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Remove accidental `debugger` left in `uncaught` overloads (used only in Dev).\n*   Prevent memory leak with Cypress helper listeners on every re-run of the tests.\n*   Prevent memory leak with custom 3rd party Cypress listeners in spec windows on every re-run of the tests.\n*   Prevent error from being thrown when `.only`'s are switched in between active test runs.\n\n## 0.4.1[​](#0-4-1 \"Direct link to 0.4.1\")\n\n_Released 04/08/2015_\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   `javascripts` files can now utilize `snockets`, `browserify`, or `requirejs`.\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Handle `javascripts` and preprocess them as we do regular specs. Fixes: [#15](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/15).\n*   Fixed an edge case when writing a test with a `done` callback alongside `cy` commands. This situation would always cause a timeout after 30 seconds even though the test would pass.\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   Internally refactored Cypress for easier testability / debuggability.\n*   Organized files around in preparation for OS release.\n*   Added lightweight module system / optimized Cypress listeners to prevent duplicated events.\n*   Changed url strategy for sending down `spec` files.\n\n## 0.4.0[​](#0-4-0 \"Direct link to 0.4.0\")\n\n_Released 04/02/2015_\n\n**Features:**\n\n*   `sinon-as-promised` is now a bundled extension.\n*   tests without an `id` now run (with a random temporarily assigned id).\n*   tests with a duplicate `id` to another test will now run (with a random temporarily assigned id).\n*   tests or suites which are manually re-run from the UI now hide all of the other tests / suites.\n\n**Bugfixes:**\n\n*   Fixed hook failure associated to wrong failed current test when `grep` was set.\n*   Async tests which used a `cy` command and had a `done` callback was always undefined. Now it's back to real Mocha `function done(err)`.\n*   Fixed bug in Mocha where it incorrectly associates `hook.ctx.currentTest` to the wrong `test`. [Mocha Issue](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha/issues/1638).\n*   [`cy.title()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/title) no longer logs twice on a failure.\n*   Fixed putting an `.only` on a large list of tests that would sometimes not clear the previous runnables in the UI.\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   Optimized first test run after hard refresh.\n*   Performance improvements on successive runnable iterations.\n*   Aborting currently running tests performance improvement.\n*   Live reload performance improvements when tests are changed.\n*   Added 100+ tests covering Runner + Reporter behavior.\n*   Aggressively cleaned up listeners after each test completion + run.\n*   Added additional `Cypress` events for 3rd party custom handling.\n\n## 0.3.15[​](#0-3-15 \"Direct link to 0.3.15\")\n\n_Released 03/28/2015_\n\n**Misc:**\n\n*   Drastically improved file watching on large projects with many tests.

Read about [best practices](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/best-practices#Web-Servers) here.\n\ninfo\n\n**Why start a local development server?**\n\nYou may be wondering - why can't I just visit my application that's already in production?\n\nWhile you certainly _can_ test an application that's already deployed, that's not really the **sweet spot** of Cypress.\n\nCypress is built, and optimized around being a tool for your daily local development. In fact, after you start using Cypress for awhile, we believe that you may find it useful to even do **all of your development** in it.\n\nUltimately you'll not only be able to **test and develop** at the same time, but you'll actually be able to build your application **faster** while getting tests \"for free\".\n\nWhat's more - since Cypress enables you to do things like **stub network requests** you can build out your web application without even needing a server to provide valid JSON responses.\n\nLast but not least - trying to shoehorn tests to an already built application is much more difficult than building it as you write tests. You'll likely encounter a series of initial up front challenges / hurdles that would have otherwise been avoided writing tests from the start.\n\nThe last, and probably most important reason why you want to test against local servers, is the ability to **control them**. When your application is running in production you can't control it.\n\nWhen it's running in development you can:\n\n*   take shortcuts\n*   seed data by running executable scripts\n*   expose test environment specific routes\n*   disable security features which make automation difficult\n*   reset state on the server / database\n\nWith that said - you still have the option to have it **both ways**.\n\nMany of our users run the _majority_ of their integration tests against a local development server, but then reserve a smaller set of **smoke tests** that run only against a deployed production app.\n\n## Step 2: Visit your server[​](#Step-2-Visit-your-server \"Direct link to Step-2-Visit-your-server\")\n\nOnce your server is running, it's time to visit it.\n\nLet's delete the `spec.cy.js` file created in the previous tutorial now that it's no longer needed.\n\n```\nrm cypress/e2e/spec.cy.js\n```\n\nNow let's create our own spec file called `home_page.cy.js`.\n\n```\ntouch cypress/e2e/home_page.cy.js\n```\n\nOnce that file is created, you should see it in the list of spec files.\n\n![List of files including home_page.cy.js](https://docs.cypress.io/img/guides/getting-started/e2e/v10/testing-your-app-home-page-spec.png)\n\nNow you'll need to add in the following code in your test file to visit your server:\n\n```\ndescribe('The Home Page', () => {  it('successfully loads', () => {    cy.visit('http://localhost:8080') // change URL to match your dev URL  })})\n```\n\nNow click on the `home_page.cy.js` file and watch Cypress open your browser.\n\nIf you forgot to start your server you'll see the error below:\n\n![Error in Cypress showing cy.visit failed](https://docs.cypress.io/img/guides/getting-started/e2e/v10/testing-your-app-visit-fail.png)\n\nIf you've started your server, then you should see your application loaded and working.\n\n## Step 3: Configure Cypress[​](#Step-3-Configure-Cypress \"Direct link to Step-3-Configure-Cypress\")\n\nIf you think ahead, you'll quickly realize that you're going to be typing this URL a lot, since every test is going to need to visit some page of your application. Luckily, Cypress provides a [configuration option](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration) for this. Let's leverage that now.\n\nOpen up your [configuration file](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration). It starts out empty, but let's add the `baseUrl` option.\n\n*   cypress.config.js\n*   cypress.config.ts\n\n```\nconst { defineConfig } = require('cypress')module.exports = defineConfig({  e2e: {    baseUrl: 'http://localhost:8080',  },})\n```\n\nThis will automatically **prefix** [`cy.visit()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/visit) and [`cy.request()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/request) commands with this baseUrl.\n\ninfo\n\nWhenever you modify your configuration file, Cypress will automatically reboot itself and kill any open browsers. This is normal. Click on the spec file again to relaunch the browser.\n\nWe can now visit a relative path and omit the hostname and port.\n\n```\ndescribe('The Home Page', () => {  it('successfully loads', () => {    cy.visit('/')  })})\n```\n\nGreat! Everything should still be green.\n\ninfo\n\n**Configuration Options**\n\nCypress has many more configuration options you can use to customize its behavior. Things like where your tests live, default timeout periods, environment variables, which reporter to use, etc.\n\nCheck them out in [Configuration](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration)!\n\n## Testing strategies[​](#Testing-strategies \"Direct link to Testing strategies\")\n\nYou're about to embark on writing tests for your application, and only _you_ know your application, so we don't have a lot of specific advice to give you.\n\n**What to test, where the edge cases and seams are, what regressions you're likely to run into, etc. are entirely up to you, your application, and your team.**\n\nThat said, modern web testing has a few wrinkles that every team experiences, so here are some quick tips on common situations you're likely to run into.\n\n### Seeding data[​](#Seeding-data \"Direct link to Seeding data\")\n\nDepending on how your application is built - it's likely that your web application is going to be affected and controlled by the server.\n\nTypically these days servers communicate with front end apps via JSON, but you could also be running a traditional server-side rendered HTML web application.\n\nGenerally the server is responsible for sending responses that reflect some kind of **state** it holds - generally in a database.\n\nTraditionally when writing `e2e` tests using Selenium, before you automate the browser you do some kind of **set up and tear down** on the server.\n\nPerhaps you'll need to generate a user, and seed them with associations and records. You may be familiar with using things such as fixtures or factories.\n\nTo test various page states - like an empty view, or a pagination view, you'd need to seed the server so that this state can be tested.\n\n**While there is a lot more to this strategy, you generally have three ways to facilitate this with Cypress:**\n\n*   [`cy.exec()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/exec) - to run system commands\n*   [`cy.task()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/task) - to run code in Node via the [setupNodeEvents](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/tooling/plugins-guide#Using-a-plugin) function\n*   [`cy.request()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/request) - to make HTTP requests\n\nIf you're running `node.js` on your server, you might add a `before` or `beforeEach` hook that executes an `npm` task.\n\n```\ndescribe('The Home Page', () => {  beforeEach(() => {    // reset and seed the database prior to every test    cy.exec('npm run db:reset && npm run db:seed')  })  it('successfully loads', () => {    cy.visit('/')  })})\n```\n\nInstead of just executing a system command, you may want more flexibility and could expose a series of routes only when running in a test environment.\n\n**For instance, you could compose several requests together to tell your server exactly the state you want to create.**\n\n```\ndescribe('The Home Page', () => {  beforeEach(() => {    // reset and seed the database prior to every test    cy.exec('npm run db:reset && npm run db:seed')    // seed a post in the DB that we control from our tests    cy.request('POST', '/test/seed/post', {      title: 'First Post',      authorId: 1,      body: '...',    })    // seed a user in the DB that we can control from our tests    cy.request('POST', '/test/seed/user', { name: 'Jane' })      .its('body')      .as('currentUser')  })  it('successfully loads', () => {    // this.currentUser will now point to the response    // body of the cy.request() that we could use    // to log in or work with in some way    cy.visit('/')  })})\n```\n\nWhile there's nothing really _wrong_ with this approach, it does add a lot of complexity. You will be battling synchronizing the state between your server and your browser - and you'll always need to set up / tear down this state before tests (which is slow).\n\nThe good news is that we aren't Selenium, nor are we a traditional e2e testing tool. That means we're not bound to the same restrictions.\n\n**With Cypress, there are several other approaches that can offer an arguably better and faster experience.**\n\n### Stubbing the server[​](#Stubbing-the-server \"Direct link to Stubbing the server\")\n\nAnother valid approach opposed to seeding and talking to your server is to bypass it altogether.\n\nWhile you'll still receive all of the regular HTML / JS / CSS assets from your server and you'll continue to [`cy.visit()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/visit) it in the same way - you can instead **stub** the JSON responses coming from it.\n\nThis means that instead of resetting the database, or seeding it with the state we want, you can force the server to respond with **whatever** you want it to. In this way, we not only prevent needing to synchronize the state between the server and browser, but we also prevent mutating state from our tests. That means tests won't build up state that may affect other tests.\n\nAnother upside is that this enables you to **build out your application** without needing the _contract_ of the server to exist. You can build it the way you want the data to be structured, and even test all of the edge cases, without needing a server.\n\nHowever - there is likely still a balance here where **both** strategies are valid (and you should likely do them).\n\nWhile stubbing is great, it means that you don't have the guarantees that these response payloads actually match what the server will send. However, there are still many valid ways to get around this:\n\n#### Generate the fixture stubs ahead of time[​](#Generate-the-fixture-stubs-ahead-of-time \"Direct link to Generate the fixture stubs ahead of time\")\n\nYou could have the server generate all of the fixture stubs for you ahead of time. This means their data will reflect what the server will actually send.\n\n#### Write a single e2e test without stubs, and then stub the rest[​](#Write-a-single-e2e-test-without-stubs-and-then-stub-the-rest \"Direct link to Write a single e2e test without stubs, and then stub the rest\")\n\nAnother more balanced approach is to integrate both strategies. You likely want to have a **single test** that takes a true `e2e` approach and stubs nothing. It'll use the feature for real - including seeding the database and setting up state.\n\nOnce you've established it's working you can then use stubs to test all of the edge cases and additional scenarios. There are no benefits to using real data in the vast majority of cases. We recommend that the vast majority of tests use stub data. They will be orders of magnitude faster, and much less complex.\n\ninfo\n\n**Guide: Network Requests**\n\nPlease read our [Guide on Network Requests](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/network-requests) for a much more thorough analysis and approach to accomplishing this.\n\n### Logging in[​](#Logging-in \"Direct link to Logging in\")\n\nOne of the first (and arguably one of the hardest) hurdles you'll have to overcome in testing is logging into your application.\n\nNothing slows a test suite down like having to log in, but all the good parts of your application most likely require an authenticated user! Here are some tips.\n\n#### Fully test the login flow -- but only once![​](#Fully-test-the-login-flow----but-only-once \"Direct link to Fully test the login flow -- but only once!\")\n\nIt's a great idea to get your signup and login flow under test coverage since it is very important to all of your users and you never want it to break.\n\nLogging in is one of those features that are **mission critical** and should likely involve your server. We recommend you test signup and login using your UI as a real user would:\n\nHere's an example alongside seeding your database:\n\n```\ndescribe('The Login Page', () => {  beforeEach(() => {    // reset and seed the database prior to every test    cy.exec('npm run db:reset && npm run db:seed')    // seed a user in the DB that we can control from our tests    // assuming it generates a random password for us    cy.request('POST', '/test/seed/user', { username: 'jane.lane' })      .its('body')      .as('currentUser')  })  it('sets auth cookie when logging in via form submission', function () {    // destructuring assignment of the this.currentUser object    const { username, password } = this.currentUser    cy.visit('/login')    cy.get('input[name=username]').type(username)    // {enter} causes the form to submit    cy.get('input[name=password]').type(`${password}{enter}`)    // we should be redirected to /dashboard    cy.url().should('include', '/dashboard')    // our auth cookie should be present    cy.getCookie('your-session-cookie').should('exist')    // UI should reflect this user being logged in    cy.get('h1').should('contain', 'jane.lane')  })})\n```\n\nYou'll likely also want to test your login UI for:\n\n*   Invalid username / password\n*   Username taken\n*   Password complexity requirements\n*   Edge cases like locked / deleted accounts\n\nEach of these likely requires a full blown e2e test.\n\n#### Reusing the login code[​](#Reusing-the-login-code \"Direct link to Reusing the login code\")\n\nAt this point there's nothing stopping you copying and pasting the login code above into every one of your tests that needs an authenticated user. Or you could even put all your tests in one big spec file and put the login code in a `beforeEach` block. But neither of those approaches is particularly maintainable, and they're certainly not very elegant. A much better solution is to write a custom `cy.login()` [command](https://docs.cypress.io/api/cypress-api/custom-commands).\n\nCustom commands allow you to easily encapsulate and reuse Cypress test logic. They let you add your own functionality to your test suite and then use it with the same [chainable and asynchronous API](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/introduction-to-cypress#The-Cypress-Command-Queue) as the built-in Cypress commands. Lets make the above login example a custom command and add it to `cypress/support/commands.js` so it can be leveraged in any spec file:\n\n```\n// In cypress/support/commands.jsCypress.Commands.add('login', (username, password) => {  cy.visit('/login')  cy.get('input[name=username]').type(username)  // {enter} causes the form to submit  cy.get('input[name=password]').type(`${password}{enter}`, { log: false })  // we should be redirected to /dashboard  cy.url().should('include', '/dashboard')  // our auth cookie should be present  cy.getCookie('your-session-cookie').should('exist')  // UI should reflect this user being logged in  cy.get('h1').should('contain', username)})// In your spec fileit('does something on a secured page', function () {  const { username, password } = this.currentUser  cy.login(username, password)  // ...rest of test})\n```\n\n#### Improving performance[​](#Improving-performance \"Direct link to Improving performance\")\n\nYou're probably wondering what happened to our advice about logging in \"only once\". The custom command above will work just fine for testing your secured pages, but if you have more than a handful of tests, logging in before every test is going to increase the overall run time of your suite.\n\nLuckily, Cypress provides the [`cy.session()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/session) command, a powerful performance tool that lets you cache the browser context associated with your user and reuse it for multiple tests without going through multiple login flows! Let's modify the custom `cy.login()` command from our previous example to use `cy.session()`:\n\n```\nCypress.Commands.add('login', (username, password) => {  cy.session(    username,    () => {      cy.visit('/login')      cy.get('input[name=username]').type(username)      cy.get('input[name=password]').type(`${password}{enter}`, { log: false })      cy.url().should('include', '/dashboard')      cy.get('h1').should('contain', username)    },    {      validate: () => {        cy.getCookie('your-session-cookie').should('exist')      },    }  )})\n```\n\ninfo\n\n**Third-Party Login**\n\nIf your app implements login via a third-party authentication provider such as [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) or [Okta](https://www.okta.com/), you can use the [`cy.origin()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/origin) command to include their login pages as part of your authentication tests.\n\nThere's a lot going on here that's out of the scope for this introduction. Please check out the [`cy.session()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/session) documentation for a more in-depth explanation.\n\ninfo\n\n**Authentication Recipes**\n\nLogging in can be more complex than what we've just covered.\n\nWe've created several recipes covering additional scenarios like dealing with CSRF tokens or testing XHR based login forms.\n\nFeel free to [explore these additional logging in](https://docs.cypress.io/examples/recipes) recipes.\n\n## Get started[​](#Get-started \"Direct link to Get started\")\n\nOk, we're done talking.

    "markdown": "# Debugging | Cypress Documentation\n\ninfo\n\n## What you'll learn[​](#What-youll-learn \"Direct link to What-youll-learn\")\n\n*   How Cypress runs in the same event loop with your code, keeping debugging less demanding and more understandable\n*   How Cypress embraces the standard Developer Tools\n*   How and when to use `debugger` and the shorthand [`.debug()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/debug) command\n\n## Using `debugger`[​](#Using-debugger \"Direct link to Using-debugger\")\n\nYour Cypress test code runs in the same run loop as your application. This means you have access to the code running on the page, as well as the things the browser makes available to you, like `document`, `window`, and `debugger`.\n\n### Debug just like you always do[​](#Debug-just-like-you-always-do \"Direct link to Debug just like you always do\")\n\nBased on those statements, you might be tempted to throw a `debugger` into your test, like so:\n\n*   End-to-End Test\n*   Component Test\n\n```\nit('let me debug like a fiend', () => {  cy.visit('/my/page/path')  cy.get('[data-testid=\"selector-in-question\"]')  debugger // Doesn't work})\n```\n\nThis may not work exactly as you are expecting. As you may remember from the [Introduction to Cypress](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/introduction-to-cypress), `cy` commands enqueue an action to be taken later. Can you see what the test above will do given that perspective?\n\nBoth [`cy.visit()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/visit) and [`cy.get()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/get) will return immediately, having enqueued their work to be done later, and `debugger` will be executed before any of the commands have actually run. The same behavior is expected in Component Tests when using [`cy.mount()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/mount).\n\nLet's use [`.then()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/then) to tap into the Cypress command during execution and add a `debugger` at the appropriate time:\n\n*   End-to-End Test\n*   Component Test\n\n```\nit('let me debug when the after the command executes', () => {  cy.visit('/my/page/path')  cy.get('[data-testid=\"selector-in-question\"]').then(($selectedElement) => {    // Debugger is hit after the cy.visit    // and cy.get commands have completed    debugger  })})\n```\n\nNow we're in business! When you're visiting a page or mounting a component for the first time, (shown above with the [`cy.get()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/get)chain and its [`.then()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/then) attached) the commands are enqueued for Cypress to execute. The `it` block exits, and Cypress starts its work:\n\n1.  In an end-to-end test, the page is visited and Cypress waits for it to load. Alternatively, the component is mounted and rendered in a Component Test.\n2.  The element is queried, and Cypress automatically waits and retries for a few moments if it isn't found immediately.\n3.  The function passed to [`.then()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/then) is executed, with the found element yielded to it.\n4.  Within the context of the [`.then()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/then) function, the `debugger` is called, halting the browser and calling focus to the Developer Tools.\n5.  You're in! Inspect the state of your application like you normally would if you'd dropped the `debugger` into your application code.\n\n### Using [`.debug()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/debug)[​](#Using-debug \"Direct link to Using-debug\")\n\nCypress also exposes a shortcut for debugging commands, [`.debug()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/debug). Let's rewrite the test above using this helper method:\n\n*   End-to-End Test\n*   Component Test\n\n```\nit('let me debug like a fiend', () => {  cy.visit('/my/page/path')  cy.get('[data-testid=\"selector-in-question\"]').debug()})\n```\n\nThe current subject that is yielded by the [`cy.get()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/get) is exposed as the variable `subject` within your Developer Tools so that you can interact with it in the console.\n\n![Debugging Subject](https://docs.cypress.io/img/guides/debugging/debugging-subject.png)\n\nUse [`.debug()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/debug) to quickly inspect any (or many!) part(s) of your application during the test. You can attach it to any Cypress chain of commands to have a look at the system's state at that moment.\n\n## Step through test commands[​](#Step-through-test-commands \"Direct link to Step through test commands\")\n\nYou can run the test command by command using the [`.pause()`](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/pause) command.\n\n```\nit('adds items', () => {  cy.pause()  cy.get('[data-testid=\"new-todo\"]')  // more commands})\n```\n\nThis allows you to inspect the web application, the DOM, the network, and any storage after each command to make sure everything happens as expected.\n\nThough Cypress has built out [an excellent application](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/cypress-app) to help you understand what is happening in your application and your tests, there's no replacing all the amazing work browser teams have done on their built-in development tools. Once again, we see that Cypress goes _with_ the flow of the modern ecosystem, opting to leverage these tools wherever possible.\n\n### Get console logs for commands[​](#Get-console-logs-for-commands \"Direct link to Get console logs for commands\")\n\nAll of Cypress's commands, when clicked on within the [Command Log](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/cypress-app#Command-Log), print extra information about the command, its subject, and its yielded result. Try clicking around the Command Log with your Developer Tools open! You may find some useful information here.\n\n#### When clicking on `.type()` command, the Developer Tools console outputs the following:[​](#When-clicking-on-type-command-the-Developer-Tools-console-outputs-the-following \"Direct link to When-clicking-on-type-command-the-Developer-Tools-console-outputs-the-following\")\n\n![Console Log type](https://docs.cypress.io/img/api/type/console-log-of-typing-with-entire-key-events-table-for-each-character.png)\n\n## Errors[​](#Errors \"Direct link to Errors\")\n\nSometimes tests fail. Sometimes we want them to fail, just so we know they're testing the right thing when they pass. But other times, tests fail unintentionally and we need to figure out why. Cypress provides some tools to help make that process as easy as possible.\n\n### Anatomy of an error[​](#Anatomy-of-an-error \"Direct link to Anatomy of an error\")\n\nLet's take a look at the anatomy of an error and how it is displayed in Cypress, by way of a failing test.\n\n```\nit('reroutes on users page', () => {  cy.contains('Users').click()  cy.url().should('include', 'users')})\n```\n\nThe center of the `<li>Users</li>` element is hidden from view in our application under test, so the test above will fail.\n\nCypress prints several pieces of information when an error occurs during a Cypress test.\n\n1.  **Error name**: This is the type of error (e.g. `AssertionError`, `CypressError`)\n2.  **Error message**: This generally tells you what went wrong. It can vary in length. Some are short like in the example, while some are long, and may tell you exactly how to fix the error.\n3.  **Learn more:** Some error messages contain a **Learn more** link that will take you to relevant Cypress documentation.\n4.  **Code frame file**: This is usually the top line of the stack trace and it shows the file, line number, and column number that is highlighted in the code frame below. Clicking on this link will open the file in your [preferred file opener](https://on.cypress.io/IDE-integration#File-Opener-Preference) and highlight the line and column in editors that support it.\n5.  **Code frame**: This shows a snippet of code where the failure occurred, with the relevant line and column highlighted.\n6.  **View stack trace**: Clicking this toggles the visibility of the stack trace. Stack traces vary in length. Clicking on a blue file path will open the file in your [preferred file opener](https://on.cypress.io/IDE-integration#File-Opener-Preference).\n7.  **Print to console button**: Click this to print the full error to your DevTools console. This will usually allow you to click on lines in the stack trace and open files in your DevTools.\n\n![example command failure error](https://docs.cypress.io/img/guides/core-concepts/cypress-app/command-failure-error.png)\n\n### Source maps[​](#Source-maps \"Direct link to Source maps\")\n\nCypress utilizes source maps to enhance the error experience. Stack traces are translated so that your source files are shown instead of the generated file that is loaded by the browser. This also enables displaying code frames. Without inline source maps, you will not see code frames.\n\nBy default, Cypress will include an inline source map in your spec file, so you will get the most out of the error experience. If you [modify the preprocessor](https://docs.cypress.io/api/plugins/preprocessors-api), ensure that inline source maps are enabled to get the same experience. With webpack and the [webpack preprocessor](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/tree/develop/npm/webpack-preprocessor), for example, set [the `devtool` option](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/devtool/) to `inline-source-map`.\n\n## Debugging flake[​](#Debugging-flake \"Direct link to Debugging flake\")\n\nWhile Cypress is [flake-resistant](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/overview/key-differences#Flake-resistant), some users do experience flake, particularly when running in CI versus locally. Most often in cases of flaky tests, we see that there are not enough assertions surrounding test actions or network requests before moving on to the next assertion.\n\nIf there is any variation in the speed of the network requests or responses when run locally versus in CI, then there can be failures in one over the other.\n\nBecause of this, we recommend asserting on as many required steps as possible before moving forward with the test. This also helps later to isolate where the exact failure is when debugging.\n\nFlake can also occur when there are differences between your local and CI environments. You can use the following methods troubleshoot tests that pass locally but fail in CI.\n\n*   Review your CI build process to ensure nothing is changing with your application that would result in failing tests.\n*   Remove time-sensitive variability in your tests. For example, ensure a network request has finished before looking for the DOM element that relies on the data from that network request. You can leverage [aliasing](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/variables-and-aliases#Aliases) for this.\n\nCypress Cloud also offers [Analytics](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/cloud/analytics/overview) that illustrate trends in your tests and can help identify the tests that fail most often. This could help narrow down what is causing the flake -- for example, seeing increased failures after a change to the test environment could indicate issues with the new environment.\n\nFor more advice on dealing with flake read a [series of our blog posts](https://cypress.io/blog/tag/flake/) and [Identifying Code Smells in Cypress](https://codingitwrong.com/2020/10/09/identifying-code-smells-in-cypress.html) by [Cypress Ambassador](https://www.cypress.io/ambassadors/) Josh Justice.\n\n## Log Cypress events[​](#Log-Cypress-events \"Direct link to Log Cypress events\")\n\nCypress emits multiple events you can listen to as shown below. [Read more about logging events in the browser here](https://docs.cypress.io/api/cypress-api/catalog-of-events#Logging-All-Events).\n\n![console log events for debugging](https://docs.cypress.io/img/api/catalog-of-events/console-log-events-debug.png)\n\n## Troubleshooting Cypress[​](#Troubleshooting-Cypress \"Direct link to Troubleshooting Cypress\")\n\nThere are times when you will encounter errors or unexpected behavior with Cypress itself. In this situation, we recommend checking out our [Troubleshooting Guide](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/troubleshooting).\n\n## More info[​](#More-info \"Direct link to More info\")\n\nOften debugging a failing Cypress test means understanding better how your own application works, and how the application might race against the test commands. We recommend reading these blog posts where we show common error scenarios and how to solve them:\n\n*   [When Can The Test Start?](https://www.cypress.io/blog/2018/02/05/when-can-the-test-start/)\n*   [When Can The Test Stop?](https://www.cypress.io/blog/2020/01/16/when-can-the-test-stop/)\n*   [When Can The Test Click?](https://www.cypress.io/blog/2019/01/22/when-can-the-test-click/)\n*   [When Can The Test Log Out?](https://www.cypress.io/blog/2020/06/25/when-can-the-test-log-out/)\n*   [Do Not Get Too Detached](https://www.cypress.io/blog/2020/07/22/do-not-get-too-detached/)",
