    "markdown": "# Deployment Protection on Vercel\n\nDeployment Protection safeguards both your preview and production URLs across various environments. Configured at the project level through your settings, Deployment Protection provides detailed access control for different deployment types.\n\nVercel offers the following Deployment Protection features:\n\n*   [Vercel Authentication](https://vercel.com/docs/security/deployment-protection/methods-to-protect-deployments/vercel-authentication): Restricts access to your deployments to only Vercel users with suitable access rights. Vercel Authentication is available on all plans\n*   [Password Protection](https://vercel.com/docs/security/deployment-protection/methods-to-protect-deployments/password-protection): Restricts access to your deployments to only users with the correct password. Password Protection is available on the Enterprise plan, or as a paid add-on for Pro plans\n*   [Trusted IPs](https://vercel.com/docs/security/deployment-protection/methods-to-protect-deployments/trusted-ips): Restricts access to your deployments to only users with the correct IP address. Trusted IPs is available on the Enterprise plan\n\nDeployment Protection is managed through your project settings. To configure Deployment Protection:\n\n1.  From the [dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard), select the project you wish to set Deployment Protection on\n2.  Once selected, navigate to the Settings tab\n3.  From the list, select the Deployment Protection tab\n\nYou can configure the type of Deployment Protection for each environment in your project depending on your projects security needs. When choosing your protection method, you can select from three options:\n\n*   [Standard Protection](#protecting-preview-and-generated-urls-with-standard-protection): Protects all preview URLs and [production deployment URLs](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/generated-urls). All [up to date production URLs](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/generated-urls) are unprotected. Standard Protection is available on all plans\n*   [Only Preview Deployments](#protecting-only-preview-deployments): Protects only preview URLs. Protecting preview deployments is available on all plans\n*   [All Deployments](#protect-all-deployments): Protects all URLs. Protecting all deployments is available on Pro and Enterprise plans\n\nTo protect [only production URLs](#protecting-only-production-deployments), you can use [Trusted IPs](https://vercel.com/docs/security/deployment-protection/methods-to-protect-deployments/trusted-ips). Note that this option is only available on the Enterprise plan.\n\nThe Standard Protection option is the recommended way to secure all your domains, including both preview and [production deployment URLs](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/generated-urls), to limit public access.\n\nWith Standard Protection selected, `example.com` serves as your publicly-accessible production domain, while all other generated URLs would be protected.\n\nWhile generated deployment URLs are protected, up-to-date production domains remain accessible, including the branch domain\n\n![Selecting Standard Protection in the Vercel Dashboard.](https://vercel.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.vercel.com%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1698411837%2Ffront%2Fdocs%2Fsecurity%2Fstandard-protection-light.png&w=1920&q=75&dpl=dpl_6RGLzPaeBNhuWHRxN1xTYtAhKUa3)![Selecting Standard Protection in the Vercel Dashboard.](https://vercel.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.vercel.com%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1698411830%2Ffront%2Fdocs%2Fsecurity%2Fstandard-protection-dark.png&w=1920&q=75&dpl=dpl_6RGLzPaeBNhuWHRxN1xTYtAhKUa3)\n\nSelecting Standard Protection in the Vercel Dashboard.\n\nStandard Protection can be configured with the following Deployment Protection features:\n\nEnabling Standard Protection restricts public access to the production [generated deployment URL](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/generated-urls). This affects `VERCEL_URL` from [System Environment Variables](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables/system-environment-variables#system-environment-variables) and `VERCEL_URL` from [Framework Environment Variables](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables/system-environment-variables#framework-environment-variables), making them unsuitable for fetch requests.\n\nIf you are using `VERCEL_URL` to make fetch requests, you will need to update your requests to target the same domain the user has requested.\n\nThe Framework Environment Variable `VERCEL_URL` is prefixed with the name of the framework. For example, `VERCEL_URL` for Next.js is `NEXT_PUBLIC_VERCEL_URL`, and `VERCEL_URL` for Nuxt.js is `NUXT_ENV_VERCEL_URL`. See the [Framework Environment Variables](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables/system-environment-variables#framework-environment-variables) documentation for more information.\n\nFor client-side requests, use relative paths in the fetch call to target the current domain, automatically including the user's authentication cookie for protected URLs.\n\n```\n// Before\nfetch(`${process.env.VERCEL_URL}/some/path`);\n \n// After\nfetch('/some/path');\n// Note: For operations requiring fully qualified URLs, such as generating OG images,\n// replace '/some/path' with the actual domain (e.g. 'https://yourdomain.com/some/path').\n```\n\nFor server-side requests, use the origin from the incoming request and manually add request cookies to pass the user's authentication cookie.\n\n```\nconst headers = { cookie: <incoming request header cookies> };\nfetch('<incoming request origin>/some/path', { headers });\n```\n\nBypassing protection using [Protection Bypass for Automation](https://vercel.com/docs/security/deployment-protection/methods-to-bypass-deployment-protection/protection-bypass-automation) is an option but not required for requests targeting the same domain.\n\nWhen Only Preview Deployments is selected, preview URLs are protected, while the production environment remains publicly accessible. This allows for secure testing and review.\n\nFor example, Vercel generates a preview URL such as `my-preview-5678.vercel.app`, which will be protected. In contrast, all production URLs, including `example.com` and any past or current generated production branch URLs like `*-main.vercel.app`, remain accessible.\n\n![Selecting Only Preview Deployments in the Vercel Dashboard.](https://vercel.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.vercel.com%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1698413303%2Ffront%2Fdocs%2Fsecurity%2Fonly-preview-light.png&w=1920&q=75&dpl=dpl_6RGLzPaeBNhuWHRxN1xTYtAhKUa3)![Selecting Only Preview Deployments in the Vercel Dashboard.](https://vercel.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.vercel.com%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1698413299%2Ffront%2Fdocs%2Fsecurity%2Fonly-preview-dark.png&w=1920&q=75&dpl=dpl_6RGLzPaeBNhuWHRxN1xTYtAhKUa3)\n\nSelecting Only Preview Deployments in the Vercel Dashboard.\n\nProtecting only preview deployments can be configured with the following Deployment Protection features:\n\nWhen Production Deployments is selected, only your production domain, and all production deployments are secured. This is useful for restricting access to trusted IPs.\n\nFor example, if `example.com` is your production domain, it becomes secure under this setting, while preview URLs remain publicly accessible.\n\nTo protect only production deployments, use [Trusted IPs](https://vercel.com/docs/security/deployment-protection/methods-to-protect-deployments/trusted-ips).\n\n![Selecting All Deployments in the Vercel Dashboard.](https://vercel.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.vercel.com%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1698745795%2Ffront%2Fdocs%2Fsecurity%2Fprod-deployments-light.png&w=1920&q=75&dpl=dpl_6RGLzPaeBNhuWHRxN1xTYtAhKUa3)![Selecting All Deployments in the Vercel Dashboard.](https://vercel.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.vercel.com%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1698745793%2Ffront%2Fdocs%2Fsecurity%2Fprod-deployments-dark.png&w=1920&q=75&dpl=dpl_6RGLzPaeBNhuWHRxN1xTYtAhKUa3)\n\nSelecting All Deployments in the Vercel Dashboard.\n\nSelecting All Deployments secures all deployments, both preview and production, restricting public access entirely.\n\nWith this configuration, all URLs, including your production domain `example.com` and [generated URLs](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/generated-urls) like `my-project-1234.vercel.app`, are protected.\n\n![Selecting All Deployments in the Vercel Dashboard.](https://vercel.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.vercel.com%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1698412972%2Ffront%2Fdocs%2Fsecurity%2Fall-deployments-light.png&w=1920&q=75&dpl=dpl_6RGLzPaeBNhuWHRxN1xTYtAhKUa3)![Selecting All Deployments in the Vercel Dashboard.](https://vercel.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.vercel.com%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1698412976%2Ffront%2Fdocs%2Fsecurity%2Fall-deployments-dark.png&w=1920&q=75&dpl=dpl_6RGLzPaeBNhuWHRxN1xTYtAhKUa3)\n\nSelecting All Deployments in the Vercel Dashboard.\n\nProtecting all deployments can be configured with the following Deployment Protection features:\n\nAdvanced Deployment Protection features are available to Enterprise customers by default. Customers on the Pro plan can access these features for an additional $150 per month, including:\n\nTo opt-into Advanced Deployment Protection while on a Pro plan:\n\n1.  Navigate to your Project Settings and select the Deployment Protection tab\n2.  Then choose one of the above protection features\n3.  You will then be prompted to upgrade to the Advanced Deployment Protection add-on through an Enable and Pay button before you can use the feature\n\nWhen you enable Advanced Deployment Protection, you will be charged $150 per month for the add-on, and will have access to _all_ Advanced Deployment Protection features.\n\nTo opt out of Advanced Deployment Protection:\n\n1.  Navigate to your Team Settings, then the Billing page\n2.  Press Edit on the feature you want to disable and follow the instructions to disable the add-on\n\nIn order to disable Advanced Deployment Protection, you must have been using the feature for a minimum of thirty days. After this time, once cancelled, all Advanced Deployment Protection features will be disabled.",

    "markdown": "# DDoS Mitigation\n\nVercel provides automatic DDoS mitigation for all deployments, regardless of the plan that you are on. We block incoming traffic if we identify abnormal or suspicious levels of incoming requests. It works by:\n\n*   Monitoring traffic: Vercel Firewall continuously analyzes incoming traffic to detect signs of DDoS attacks. This helps to identify and mitigate threats in real-time\n*   Blocking traffic: Vercel Firewall filters out malicious traffic while allowing legitimate requests to pass through\n*   Scaling resources: During a DDoS attack, Vercel Firewall dynamically scales resources to absorb the increased traffic, preventing your applications or sites from being overwhelmed\n\nIf you need further control over incoming traffic, you can temporarily enable [Attack Challenge Mode](https://vercel.com/docs/security/attack-challenge-mode) to challenge all visitors to your site.\n\n**Note:** If you need dedicated DDoS support, contact us to discuss Enterprise.\n\n[Contact Sales](https://vercel.com/contact/sales)\n\nA Denial of Service (DoS) attack happens when one device attempts to exhaust the resources of a system by sending a large amount of data to a server or network. These attacks can often be mitigated by finding and closing off the connection to the source of the attack.\n\nA Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack happens when multiple connected devices are used to simultaneously overwhelm a site with targeted, fake traffic. The goal of DoS and DDoS attacks is to disrupt access to the servers hosting the site.\n\nThe OSI model is a concept that outlines the different communication steps of a networking system. Different attack types can target different layers of the [OSI model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model).\n\nDDoS attacks often target the [network](#layer-3-ddos) (layer 3), [transport](#layer-4-ddos) (layer 4), and [application](#layer-7-ddos) (layer 7) layers of the OSI model. Vercel mitigates against these attacks, and protects the entire platform and all customers from attacks that would otherwise affect reliability.\n\nThe goal of a layer 3 (L3) DDoS attack is to slow down and ultimately crash applications, servers, and entire networks. These attacks are often used to target specific IP addresses, but can also target entire networks.\n\nThe goal of a layer 4 (L4) DDoS attack is to crash and slow down applications. They target the 3-way-handshake performed on TCP connections. This is often called a SYN flood. Layer 4 DDoS attacks are used to target specific ports, but can also target entire protocols.\n\nThe goal of a Layer 7 (L7) DDoS attack is to crash and slow down software at the application layer by targeting protocols such as HTTP, GET, and POST requests. They are often silent and look to leverage vulnerabilities by sending many innocuous requests to a single page. Vercel provides sophisticated proprietary L7 mitigation and is constantly tuning and adjusting attack detection techniques.\n\nVercel mitigates against L3, L4, and L7 DDoS attacks regardless of the plan you are on. The Vercel Firewall uses hundreds of signals and detection factors to fingerprint request patterns, determining if they appear to be an attack, and challenging or blocking requests if they appear illegitimate.\n\nHowever, there are other steps you can take to protect your site during DDoS attacks:\n\n*   Enable [Attack Challenge Mode](https://vercel.com/docs/security/attack-challenge-mode) to challenge all visitors to your site. This is a temporary measure and provides another layer of security to ensure all traffic to your site is legitimate\n*   You can set up [IP Blocking](https://vercel.com/docs/security/vercel-waf/ip-blocking) to block specific IP addresses from accessing your projects. Enterprise teams can also receive dedicated DDoS support\n*   You can add [Custom Rules](https://vercel.com/docs/security/vercel-waf/custom-rules) to deny or challenge specific traffic to your site based on the conditions of the rules\n*   You can also use Edge Middleware to [block requests](https://github.com/vercel/examples/tree/main/edge-middleware/geolocation-country-block) based on specific criteria or to implement [rate limiting](https://vercel.com/guides/rate-limiting-edge-middleware-vercel-kv).\n\nPro teams can [set up Spend Management](https://vercel.com/docs/accounts/spend-management#managing-your-spend-amount) to get notified or to automatically take action, such as [using a webhook](https://vercel.com/docs/accounts/spend-management#configuring-a-webhook) or [pausing your projects](https://vercel.com/docs/accounts/spend-management#pausing-projects) when your usage hits a set spend amount.\n\n[Vercel automatically mitigates against L3, L4, and L7 DDoS attacks](https://vercel.com/docs/security/ddos-mitigation) at the platform level for all plans. Vercel does not charge customers for traffic that gets blocked by the Firewall.\n\nUsage will be incurred for requests that are successfully served prior to us automatically mitigating the event.

With the command-line interface (CLI) you can interact with the Vercel platform using a terminal, or through an automated system, enabling you to [retrieve logs](https://vercel.com/docs/cli/logs), manage [certificates](https://vercel.com/docs/cli/certs), replicate your deployment environment [locally](https://vercel.com/docs/cli/dev), manage Domain Name System (DNS) [records](https://vercel.com/docs/cli/dns), and more.\n\nIf you'd like to interface with the platform programmatically, check out the [REST API documentation](https://vercel.com/docs/rest-api).\n\nTo download and install Vercel CLI, run the following command:\n\nWhen there is a new release of Vercel CLI, running any command will show you a message letting you know that an update is available.\n\nIf you have installed our command-line interface through [npm](http://npmjs.org/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), the easiest way to update it is by running the installation command yet again.\n\nIf you see permission errors, please read npm's [official guide](https://docs.npmjs.com/resolving-eacces-permissions-errors-when-installing-packages-globally). Yarn depends on the same configuration as npm.\n\nThe `--version` option can be used to verify the version of Vercel CLI currently being used.\n\nUsing the `vercel` command with the `--version` option.\n\nVercel CLI requires you to log in and authenticate before accessing resources or performing administrative tasks. In a terminal environment, you can use [`vercel login`](https://vercel.com/docs/cli/login), which requires manual input. In a CI/CD environment where manual input is not possible, you can create a token on your [tokens page](https://vercel.com/account/tokens) and then use the [`--token` option](https://vercel.com/docs/cli/global-options#token) to authenticate.",

    "markdown": "# Incremental Migration to Vercel\n\nWhen migrating to Vercel you should use an incremental migration strategy. This allows your current site and your new site to operate simultaneously, enabling you to move different sections of your site at a pace that suits you.\n\nIn this guide, we'll explore incremental migration benefits and different [strategies](#incremental-migration-strategies).\n\nIncremental migrations offer several advantages:\n\n*   Reduced risk due to smaller migration steps\n*   A smoother rollback path in case of unexpected issues\n*   Earlier technical implementation and business value validation\n*   Downtime-free migration without maintenance windows\n\nOne-time migration involves developing the new site separately before switching traffic over. This approach has certain drawbacks:\n\n*   Late discovery of expensive product issues\n*   Difficulty in assessing migration success upfront\n*   Potential for reaching a point of no-return, even with major problem detection\n*   Possible business loss due to legacy system downtime during migration\n\nDespite requiring more effort to make the new and legacy sites work concurrently, incremental migration is beneficial if:\n\n*   Risk reduction and time-saving benefits outweigh the effort\n*   The extra effort needed for specific increments to interact with legacy data doesn't exceed the time saved\n\n![](https://vercel.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.vercel.com%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1689795055%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Fincremental-migration%2Fincremental-migration-steps-light.png&w=3840&q=75&dpl=dpl_6RGLzPaeBNhuWHRxN1xTYtAhKUa3)![](https://vercel.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.vercel.com%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1689795055%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Fincremental-migration%2Fincremental-migration-steps-dark.png&w=3840&q=75&dpl=dpl_6RGLzPaeBNhuWHRxN1xTYtAhKUa3)\n\nIncremental migration process\n\nWith incremental migration, legacy and new systems operate simultaneously. Depending on your strategy, you'll select a system aspect, like a feature or user group, to migrate incrementally.\n\nThis strategy targets system features with the following process:\n\n1.  Identify all legacy system features\n2.  Choose key features for the initial migration\n3.  Repeat until all features have been migrated\n\nThroughout, both systems operate in parallel with migrated features routed to the new system.\n\nThis strategy focuses on system users with the following process:\n\n1.  Identify all user groups\n2.  Select a user group for initial migration to the new system\n3.  Repeat until all users have been migrated\n\nDuring migration, a subset of users accesses the new system while others continue using the legacy system.\n\nA blend of vertical and horizontal strategies. For each feature subset, migrate by user group before moving to the next feature subset.",

    "markdown": "# Vercel REST API\n\nVercel REST API allows developers to interact programmatically with their Vercel account and services using HTTP requests.\n\nWith the API, developers can deploy new versions of web applications, manage custom domains, retrieve information about deployments, and manage secrets and environment variables for projects.\n\nThe API supports any programming language or framework that can send HTTP requests.\n\nYou can use the commands listed below with `curl` by providing your [token](https://vercel.com/account/tokens).\n\nOur API is exposed as an HTTP/1 and HTTP/2 service over SSL. All endpoints live under the URL `https://api.vercel.com` and then generally follow the REST architecture.\n\nThe API supports HTTP versions 1, 1.1, and 2, although HTTP/2 is preferred.\n\nTLS versions 1.2 and 1.3 are supported, with resumption.\n\nFor more information on TLS support, refer to the [SSL Labs report](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=api.vercel.com&hideResults=on&latest).\n\nAll requests must be encoded as JSON with the `Content-Type: application/json` header. If not otherwise specified, responses from the Vercel API, including errors, are encoded exclusively as JSON as well.\n\nVercel Access Tokens are required to authenticate and use the Vercel API.\n\n```\n  Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>\n```\n\nThe `Authorization` header with an access token.\n\nAccess Tokens can be created and managed from inside your [account settings](https://vercel.com/account/tokens).\n\n![Create a new Access Token.](https://vercel.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.vercel.com%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1701697368%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Frest-api%2Fcreate-token-light.png&w=1920&q=75&dpl=dpl_6RGLzPaeBNhuWHRxN1xTYtAhKUa3)![Create a new Access Token.](https://vercel.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.vercel.com%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1701697369%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Frest-api%2Fcreate-token-dark.png&w=1920&q=75&dpl=dpl_6RGLzPaeBNhuWHRxN1xTYtAhKUa3)\n\nCreate a new Access Token.\n\n1.  In the upper-right corner of your [dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard), click your profile picture, then select Settings\n2.  Select Tokens from the sidebar\n3.  Enter a descriptive name for the token\n4.  Choose the scope from the list of Teams in the drop-down menu. The scope ensures that only your specified Team(s) can use an Access Token\n5.  From the drop-down, select an expiration date for the Token\n6.  Click Create Token\n7.  Once you've created an Access Token, securely store the value as it will not be shown again.\n\nSetting an expiration date on an Access Token is highly recommended and is considered one of the standard security practices that helps keep your information secure. You can select from a default list of expiration dates ranging from 1 day to 1 year. You can view the expiration date of your Access Tokens on the [tokens page.](https://vercel.com/account/tokens)\n\nBy default, you can access resources contained within your own user account (personal).\n\nTo access resources owned by a team, or create a project for a _specific_ team, you must first find the [Team ID](https://vercel.com/docs/teams-and-accounts/create-or-join-a-team#find-your-team-id).\n\nAfter you obtained the Team ID, append it as a query string at the end of the API endpoint URL:\n\n```\nhttps://api.vercel.com/v6/deployments?teamId=[teamID]\n```\n\nReplace `[teamID]` with the Team ID you obtained.\n\nYou still need to provide an API token through the `Authorization` header.\n\nIf authentication is unsuccessful for a request, the [error status code](#errors) 403 is returned.\n\nWhen the API response includes an array of records, a pagination object is returned when the total number of records present is greater than the limit per request. The default value of this limit is 20 but it can be changed by passing a value to the query parameter `limit` when the request is made. The maximum possible value of `limit` is 100.\n\nYou can then use the pagination object to make additional requests and obtain all the records.\n\nThe pagination object is structured as shown in the example below:\n\n```\n{\n  \"pagination\": {\n    \"count\": 20, //Amount of items in the current page.\n    \"next\": 1555072968396, //Timestamp that must be used to request the next page.\n    \"prev\": 1555413045188 //Timestamp that must be used to request the previous page.\n  }\n}\n```\n\nPagination object returned with response\n\nIn order to obtain the records for the next batch, perform the following actions:\n\n1.  Send a request to the same API endpoint\n2.  Include the query parameter `until` with a value equal to the timestamp value of `next` returned in the previous request\n3.  Repeat this sequence until the pagination object has a `next` value of `null`\n\nThis is an example of applying this sequence with `Node.js` to save all the projects in your personal account to a `json` file:\n\n```\nconst axios = require('axios');\nconst fs = require('fs');\nconst vercelToken = 'yourtokenvalue'; //Replace with your token\nconst apiEndPt = 'https://api.vercel.com/v9/projects';\n \nlet config = {\n  method: 'get',\n  url: apiEndPt,\n  headers: {\n    Authorization: 'Bearer ' + vercelToken,\n  },\n};\nlet results = [];\n \n(function loop() {\n  axios(config)\n    .then(function (response) {\n      results.push(...response.data.projects);\n      if (response.data.pagination.next !== null) {\n        config.url = `${apiEndPt}?until=${response.data.pagination.next}`;\n        loop();\n      } else {\n        //you can use the final results object and for example save it to a json file\n        fs.writeFileSync('projects.json', JSON.stringify(results));\n      }\n    })\n    .catch(function (error) {\n      console.log(error);\n    });\n})();\n```\n\nSave all the Projects in your Vercel personal account to `projects.json`\n\nAll API endpoints contain a `code` and `message` within the error responses, though some API endpoints extend the `error` object to contain other information. Each endpoint that does this will be documented in their appropriate section.\n\nWhile we recommend that you write error messages that fit your needs and provide your users with the best experience, our `message` fields are designed to be neutral, not contain sensitive information, and can be safely passed down to user interfaces.\n\n```\n{\n  \"error\": {\n    \"code\": \"forbidden\",\n    \"message\": \"Not authorized\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAn example of an unauthorized request error.\n\nWe limit the number of calls you can make over a certain period of time. Rate limits vary and are specified by the following header in all responses:\n\n| Header | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `X-RateLimit-Limit` | The maximum number of requests that the consumer is permitted to make. |\n| `X-RateLimit-Remaining` | The number of requests remaining in the current rate limit window. |\n| `X-RateLimit-Reset` | The time at which the current rate limit window resets in UTC epoch seconds. |\n\nWhen the rate limit is exceeded, an error is returned with the status \"429 Too Many Requests\":\n\n```\n{\n  \"error\": {\n    \"code\": \"too_many_requests\",\n    \"message\": \"Rate limit exceeded\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAn example of a rate limit exceeded error.\n\nAll endpoints and examples are designated with a specific version. Versions vary per endpoint and are not global.\n\nThe response shape of a certain endpoint is not guaranteed to be fixed over time. In particular, we might add new keys to responses without bumping a version endpoint, which will be noted in the changelog.\n\nTo ensure the security and correctness of your application, make sure to only read the keys from the response that your application needs. Don't proxy entire responses to third-parties without validation.\n\nOld versions of each endpoint are supported for as long as possible. When we intend to deprecate, we will notify users in the changelog section.\n\nEndpoint versions follow the base URL and come before the endpoint. For example:\n\n```\nhttps://api.vercel.com/v6/deployments`\n```\n\nUsing version `6` of the [deployments endpoint](#endpoints/deployments).\n\nThe following is a list of the types of data used within the Vercel API:\n\n| Name | Definition | Example |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ID  | A unique value used to identify resources. | `\"V0fra8eEgQwEpFhYG2vTzC3K\"` |\n| String | A string is a sequence of characters used to represent text. | `\"value\"` |\n| Integer | An integer is a number without decimals. | `1234` |\n| Float | A float is a number with decimals. | `12.34` |\n| Map | A data structure with a list of values assigned to a unique key. | `{ \"key\": \"value\" }` |\n| List | A data structure with only a list of values separated by a comma. | `[\"value\", 1234, 12.34]` |\n| Enum | An Enum is a String with only a few possible valid values. | `A \\| B` |\n| Date | An Integer representing a date in milliseconds since the UNIX epoch. | `1540095775941` |\n| Boolean | A Boolean is a type of two possible values representing true or false. | `true` |\n\nChecks are tests and assertions that run after each deployment has been built. They are powered by [Integrations](https://vercel.com/docs/integrations), which allow you to connect any third-party service of your choice with Vercel. Learn more about [Checks](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/checks) for deployments.\n\nPlease update the Check `status` to `running` once you have begun performing the respective action within your service. Updating the Check with a `conclusion` will automatically set the Check `status` to `completed`.\n\nBased on the `conclusion`, a deployment may fail:\n\n| Conclusion | `blocking` equals to true |\n| --- | --- |\n| cancelled | Yes |\n| failed | Yes |\n| neutral | No  |\n| succeeded | No  |\n| skipped | No  |\n\nThe output of a check can contain arbitrary data, or can contain Web Vitals and a Virtual Experience Score.\n\nTo include Web Vitals and a Virtual Experience Score, the following can be passed to `output` under a `metrics` field:\n\nEach of these has the following properties:\n\n| Key | [Type](#api-basics/types) | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| value | [Float](#api-basics/types) | The value measured for the particular metric, in milliseconds. For virtualExperienceScore this value is the percentage between 0 and 1 |\n| previousValue | [Float](#api-basics/types) | A previous value for comparison purposes. |\n| source | [Enum](#api-basics/types) | `web-vitals` |\n\nLog Drains allow you to collect logs from your deployments. To enable Log Drains, you must provide a destination URL to send the logs to.\n\nWe send logs to destination URLs over `HTTPS`, `HTTP`, `TLS`, or `TCP` every time logs are generated.\n\nWe support 3 types of Log Drains:\n\n*   JSON\n*   NDJSON\n*   Syslog\n\nFor more information, review [Format and Transport](https://vercel.com/docs/log-drains#format-and-transport).\n\nWhen you choose the `json` type, the URL receives a HTTPS or HTTP POST request with a JSON array on the `POST` body.\n\nIf the response of the request returns an HTTP `statusCode` with a value of `-1`, that means there was no response returned and the lambda crashed. In the same response, if the value of `proxy.statusCode` is returned with `-1`, that means the revalidation occurred in the background.\n\nThe logs are buffered and submitted as batches with the following formats:\n\n```\n[\n  {\n    \"id\": <identifier>,\n    \"message\": <text>,\n    \"timestamp\": <timestamp>,\n    \"type\": <\"stdout\" or \"stderr\">,\n    \"source\": <\"build\", \"static\", \"external\", or \"lambda\">,\n    \"projectId\": <identifier of project>,\n    \"deploymentId\": <identifier of deployment>,\n    \"buildId\": <identifier of build>,\n    \"host\": <hostname>,\n    \"entrypoint\": <entrypoint>\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": <identifier>,\n    \"message\": <text>,\n    \"timestamp\": <timestamp>,\n    \"requestId\": <identifier of request>,\n    \"statusCode\": <HTTP status code of request>,\n    \"source\": <\"build\", \"static\", \"external\", or \"lambda\">,\n    \"projectId\": <identifier of project>,\n    \"deploymentId\": <identifier of deployment>,\n    \"executionRegion\": <region where the request is executed>,\n    \"buildId\": <identifier of build only on build logs>,\n    \"destination\": <origin of external content only on external logs>,\n    \"host\": <hostname>,\n    \"path\": <path>,\n    \"level\": <\"error\", \"warning\", or \"info\">,\n    \"proxy\": {\n      \"timestamp\": <timestamp of proxy request>,\n      \"method\": <method of request>,\n      \"scheme\": <protocol of request>,\n      \"host\": <hostname>,\n      \"path\": <path of proxy request>,\n      \"userAgent\": <user agent>,\n      \"referer\": <referer>,\n      \"statusCode\": <HTTP status code of proxy request>,\n      \"clientIp\": <client IP>,\n      \"region\": <region request is processed>,\n      \"cacheId\": <original request id when request is served from cache>,\n      \"errorCode\": <error code happened on proxy request>,\n    }\n  }\n]\n```\n\nThe requests are posted with an [`x-vercel-signature`](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/headers#x-vercel-signature) header which contains a hash signature you can use to validate the request body. See the [Securing your Log Drains](https://vercel.com/docs/rest-api#introduction/api-basics/securing-your-log-drains) section to learn how to verify requests.\n\nWhen you choose the `ndjson` type, the URL receives a HTTPS or HTTP POST request with JSON objects delimited by newline (`\\\\n`) on the `POST` body. See [ndjson.org](http://ndjson.org/) for more information on the structure.\n\nEach request receives HTTP headers including [`x-vercel-signature`](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/headers#x-vercel-signature).\n\nThe following are two example `POST` bodies:\n\n```\n{\n  \"id\": \"1573817187330377061717300000\",\n  \"message\": \"done\",\n  \"timestamp\": 1573817187330,\n  \"type\": \"stdout\",\n  \"source\": \"build\",\n  \"projectId\": \"abcdefgdufoJxB6b9b1fEqr1jUtFkyavUURbnDCFCnZxgs\",\n  \"deploymentId\": \"dpl_233NRGRjVZX1caZrXWtz5g1TAksD\",\n  \"buildId\": \"bld_cotnkcr76\",\n  \"host\": \"*.vercel.app\",\n  \"entrypoint\": \"api/index.js\"\n}\n```\n\n```\n{\n  \"id\": \"1573817250283254651097202070\",\n  \"message\": \"START RequestId: 643af4e3-975a-4cc7-9e7a-1eda11539d90 Version: $LATEST\\\\n2019-11-15T11:27:30.721Z\\\\t643af4e3-975a-4cc7-9e7a-1eda11539d90\\\\tINFO\\\\thello\\\\nEND RequestId: 643af4e3-975a-4cc7-9e7a-1eda11539d90\\\\nREPORT RequestId: 643af4e3-975a-4cc7-9e7a-1eda11539d90\\\\tDuration: 16.76 ms\\\\tBilled Duration: 100 ms\\\\tMemory Size: 1024 MB\\\\tMax Memory Used: 78 MB\\\\tInit Duration: 186.49 ms\\\\t\\\\n\",\n  \"timestamp\": 1573817250283,\n  \"source\": \"lambda\",\n  \"requestId\": \"894xj-1573817250172-7847d20a4939\",\n  \"statusCode\": 200,\n  \"proxy\": {\n    \"timestamp\": 1573817250172,\n    \"path\": \"/api\",\n    \"userAgent\": [\n      \"Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_14_6) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/78.0.3904.97 Safari/537.36\"\n    ],\n    \"referer\": \"*.vercel.app\",\n    \"method\": \"GET\",\n    \"scheme\": \"https\",\n    \"host\": \"*.vercel.app\",\n    \"statusCode\": 200,\n    \"clientIp\": \"120.75.16.101\",\n    \"region\": \"sfo1\"\n  },\n  \"projectId\": \"abcdefgdufoJxB6b9b1fEqr1jUtFkyavUURbnDCFCnZxgs\",\n  \"deploymentId\": \"dpl_233NRGRjVZX1caZrXWtz5g1TAksD\",\n  \"host\": \"*.vercel.app\",\n  \"path\": \"api/index.js\"\n}\n```\n\nWhen you choose the `syslog` type, the URL is connected with TLS or TCP.

On syslog drains, the signature is computed using an OAuth2 secret and the `MSG` section of the syslog format.\n\nAll drains support transport-level encryption using `HTTPS` or `TLS` protocols, and we strongly recommend using them on production and use others only for development and testing.\n\nWhen your server starts receiving payloads, it could be a third party sending log messages to your server if they know the URL. Therefore, it is recommended to use HTTP Basic Authentication, or verify messages are sent from Vercel using an OAuth2 secret and hash signature.\n\nFor example, if you have a basic HTTP server subscribing to Log Drains, the payload can be validated like so:\n\n```\nconst http = require('http');\nconst crypto = require('crypto');\nhttp\n  .createServer((req, res) => {\n    var body = '';\n    req.on('data', function (chunk) {\n      body += chunk;\n    });\n    req.on('end', function () {\n      if (!verifySignature(req, body)) {\n        res.statusCode = 403;\n        res.end(\"signature didn't match\");\n        return;\n      }\n      res.end('ok');\n    });\n  })\n  .listen(3000);\nfunction verifySignature(req, body) {\n  const signature = crypto\n    .createHmac('sha1', process.env.OAUTH2_SECRET)\n    .update(body)\n    .digest('hex');\n  return signature === req.headers['x-vercel-signature'];\n}\n```\n\nYou can compute the signature using an HMAC hexdigest from the `secret` token of the OAuth2 app and request body, then compare it with the value of the `x-vercel-signature` header to validate the payload.",

You can build your web applications with anything from Astro to SvelteKit, and in many cases deploy them without having to do any upfront configuration. Learn how to [get started with Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/getting-started-with-vercel) or clone one of our example repos to your favorite git provider and deploy it on Vercel using one of the templates below:\n\n## Deploy a Template\n\nVercel deployments can [integrate with your git provider](https://vercel.com/docs/git) to [generate preview URLs](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/preview-deployments) for each pull request you make to your project.\n\nDeploying on Vercel with one of our [supported frameworks](https://vercel.com/docs/frameworks/more-frameworks) gives you access to many features, such as:\n\n*   [Serverless Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/functions) enable developers to write functions that scale based on traffic demands, preventing failures during peak hours and reducing costs during low activity.\n*   [Edge Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/functions) are a fast, scalable solution for delivering dynamic content quickly and globally. By default, Edge Functions are deployed near your site's visitors in one of Vercel's Edge regions.\n*   [Edge Middleware](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/edge-middleware) is code that executes before a request is processed on a site, enabling you to modify the response. Because it runs before the cache, Edge Middleware is an effective way to personalize statically generated content.\n*   [Multi-runtime Support](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/runtimes) allows the use of various runtimes for your functions, each with unique libraries, APIs, and features tailored to different technical requirements.\n*   [Incremental Static Regeneration](https://vercel.com/docs/incremental-static-regeneration) enables content updates without redeployment. Vercel caches the page to serve it statically and rebuilds it on a specified interval.\n*   [Speed Insights](https://vercel.com/docs/speed-insights) provide data on your project's Core Web Vitals performance in the Vercel dashboard, helping you improve loading speed, responsiveness, and visual stability.\n*   [Analytics](https://vercel.com/docs/analytics) offer detailed insights into your website's performance over time, including metrics like top pages, top referrers, and user demographics.\n*   [Skew Protection](https://vercel.com/deployments/skew-protection) uses version locking to ensure that the client and server use the same version of your application, preventing version skew and related errors.\n\nThe following table shows which features are supported by each framework on Vercel. The framework list represents the most popular frameworks deployed on Vercel.\n\nSupported\n\nNot Supported\n\nNot Applicable\n\nThe [Build Output API](https://vercel.com/docs/build-output-api/v3) is a file-system-based specification for a directory structure that produces a Vercel deployment. It is primarily targeted at framework authors who want to integrate their frameworks with Vercel's platform features. By implementing this directory structure as the output of their build command, framework authors can utilize all Vercel platform features, such as Serverless Functions, Edge Functions, Routing, and Caching.\n\nIf you are not using a framework, you can still use these features by manually creating and populating the `.vercel/output` directory according to this specification. Complete examples of Build Output API directories can be found in [vercel/examples](https://github.com/vercel/examples/tree/main/build-output-api), and you can read our [blog post](https://vercel.com/blog/build-your-own-web-framework) on using the Build Output API to build your own framework with Vercel.\n\nLearn more about deploying your preferred framework on Vercel with the following resources:",

See [our project dashboard docs](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/project-dashboard) to learn more.\n\nIn Project Settings, you can make changes about all areas relating to your project, including domains, log drains, integrations, Git, caching, environment variables, deployment protection, and security.\n\nTo edit project settings:\n\n1.  Ensure you have selected your Team from the [scope selector](https://vercel.com/docs/dashboard-features#scope-selector)\n2.  Choose a project from the [dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)\n3.  Select the Settings tab\n4.  Find the settings you need and make changes\n\nProject names can be up to 100 characters long and must be lowercase. They can include letters, digits, and the following characters: '.', '\\_', '-'. However, they cannot contain the sequence '---'.\n\nYou can edit settings regarding the build and development settings, root directory, and the [install command](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/configure-a-build#install-command). See the [Configure a build documentation](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/configure-a-build) to learn more.\n\nThe changes you make to these settings will only be applied starting from your next deployment.\n\nNone of your existing deployments will be affected when you toggle this setting. If you’d like to make the source code or logs private on your existing deployments, the only option is to delete these deployments.\n\nLearn more about how to customize the Node.js version of your project in the [Runtimes](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/serverless-functions/runtimes/node-js#node.js-version) documentation.\n\nTo locate your Project ID:\n\n1.

Choose your project from the [dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)\n3.  Select the Settings tab\n4.  Under General, scroll down until you find Project ID. The ID should start `prj_`\n5.  Copy the Project ID to use as needed\n\nLearn more about using Comments on preview deployments in the [Comments](https://vercel.com/docs/workflow-collaboration/comments) docs.\n\nYou can configure Environment Variables directly from Project Settings. Check out [the Environment Variables documentation](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables) to learn more.\n\nYou can [add custom domains](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/domains/add-a-domain) for each project. See the [Domains documentation](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/domains) to learn more.\n\nOnce you have [connected a Git repository](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/git#deploying-a-git-repository), select the Git menu item from your project settings page to edit your project’s Git settings. These settings include:\n\n*   Specifying the production branch name\n*   Managing Git Large File Storage (LFS)\n*   Creating Deploy Hooks\n*   Ignoring the build step when a commit is pushed to the Git repository\n\nTo disconnect your Git repository from your Vercel project:\n\n1.  Choose a project from the [dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)\n2.  Select the Settings tab and then select the Git menu item\n3.  Under Connected Git Repository, select the Disconnect button.\n\nIf you have [LFS objects](https://git-lfs.com/) in your repository, you can enable or disable support for them from the [project settings](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/project-dashboard#settings). When support is enabled, Vercel will pull the LFS objects that are used in your repository.\n\nBy default, Vercel creates a new [deployment](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/overview) and build (unless the Build Step is [skipped](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/configure-a-build#skip-build-step)) for every commit pushed to your connected Git repository.\n\nEach commit in Git is assigned a unique hash value commonly referred to as SHA. If the SHA of the commit was already deployed in the past, no new Deployment is created. In that case, the last Deployment matching that SHA is returned instead.\n\nTo ignore the build step:\n\n1.  Choose a project from the [dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)\n2.  Select the Settings tab and then select the Git menu item\n3.  In the Ignored Build Step section, select the behavior you would like. This behavior provides a command that outputs a code, which tells Vercel whether to issue a new build or not. The command is executed within the [Root Directory](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/configure-a-build#root-directory) and can access all [System Environment Variables](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables/system-environment-variables):\n    *   Automatic: Each commit will issue a new build\n    *   Only build production: When the `VERCEL_ENV` is production, a new build will be issued\n    *   Only build preview: When the `VERCEL_ENV` is preview, a new build will be issued\n    *   Only build if there are changes: A new build will be issued only when the Git diff contains changes\n    *   Only build if there are changes in a folder: A new build will be issued only when the Git diff contains changes in a folder that you specify\n    *   Only build Turborepo app if there are changes: automatically detect if your project or one of its dependencies has changed and needs to be built and deployed. See the [`turbo-ignore` docs](https://vercel.com/docs/monorepos/turborepo#using-turbo-ignore) to learn more.\n    *   Don't build anything: A new build will never be issued\n    *   Run my Bash script: [Run a Bash script](https://vercel.com/guides/how-do-i-use-the-ignored-build-step-field-on-vercel#with-a-script) from a location that you specify\n    *   Run my Node script: [Run a Node script](https://vercel.com/guides/how-do-i-use-the-ignored-build-step-field-on-vercel#with-a-script) from a location that you specify\n    *   Custom: You can enter any other command here, for example, only building an Nx app ([`npx nx-ignore <project-name>`](https://github.com/nrwl/nx-labs/tree/main/packages/nx-ignore#usage))\n4.  When your deployment enters the `BUILDING` state, the command you've entered in the Ignored Build Step section will be run. The command will always exit with either code `1` or `0`:\n    *   If the command exits with code `1`, the build continues as normal\n    *   If the command exits with code `0`, the build is immediately aborted, and the deployment state is set to `CANCELED`\n\nCanceled builds are counted as full deployments as they execute a build command in the build step. This means that any canceled builds initiated using the ignore build step will still count towards your deployment quota.\n\nTo learn about more advanced usage see the [\"How do I use the Ignored Build Step field on Vercel?\"](https://vercel.com/guides/how-do-i-use-the-ignored-build-step-field-on-vercel) guide.\n\nIf you have set an ignore build step command or [script](https://vercel.com/guides/how-do-i-use-the-ignored-build-step-field-on-vercel), you can also skip the build step when redeploying your app:\n\n1.  From the Vercel dashboard, select your project\n2.  Select the Deployments tab and find your deployment\n3.  Click the ellipses (...) and from the context menu, select Redeploy\n4.  Uncheck the Use project's Ignore Build Step checkbox\n\nVercel supports deploy hooks, which are unique URLs that accept HTTP POST requests and trigger deployments. Check out [our Deploy Hooks documentation](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/deploy-hooks) to learn more.\n\nProtect your project deployments with [Vercel Authentication](https://vercel.com/docs/security/deployment-protection/methods-to-protect-deployments/vercel-authentication) and [Password Protection](https://vercel.com/docs/security/deployment-protection/methods-to-protect-deployments/password-protection). See [Deployment Protection](https://vercel.com/docs/security/deployment-protection) to learn more.\n\nTo adjust your project's security settings:\n\n1.  Select your project from your [dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)\n2.  Select the Settings tab\n3.  Choose the Security menu item\n\nFrom here you can enable or disable [Attack Challenge Mode](https://vercel.com/docs/security/attack-challenge-mode), [Logs and Source Protection](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/overview#logs-and-source-protection), and [Git Fork Protection](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/overview#git-fork-protection).\n\nBy default, the following paths mentioned below can only be accessed by you and authenticated members of your Vercel team:\n\n*   `/_src`: Displays the source code and build output.\n*   `/_logs`: Displays the build logs.\n\nDisabling Logs and Source Protection will make your source code and logs publicly accessible. Do not edit this setting if you don't want them to be publicly accessible.\n\nThis setting is overwritten when a deployment is created using Vercel CLI with the [`--public` option](https://vercel.com/docs/cli/deploy#public) or the [`public` property](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/project-configuration#public) is used in `vercel.json`.\n\nFor deployments created before July 9th, 2020 at 7:05 AM (UTC), only the Project Settings is considered for determining whether the deployment's Logs and Source are publicly accessible or not. It doesn't matter if the `--public` flag was passed when creating those Deployments.\n\nIf you receive a pull request from a fork of your repository that includes a change to the [`vercel.json`](https://vercel.com/docs/cli) file or the Project has [Environment Variables](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables), Vercel will require authorization from you or a [Team Member](https://vercel.com/docs/accounts/team-members-and-roles/managing-team-members) to deploy the pull request.\n\nThis behavior protects you from leaking sensitive Project information.\n\nYou can disable this protection in the Security section of your Project Settings.\n\nDo not disable this setting until you review Environment Variables in your Project as well as `vercel.json` in your source code.\n\nYou can choose to temporarily pause a project to ensure that you do not incur usage from [metered resources](https://vercel.com/docs/limits/overview#additional-resources) on your production deployment.\n\nTo [pause your project when you reach your spend amount](https://vercel.com/docs/accounts/spend-management#pausing-projects), select the Pause all production deployments in the Spend Management section of your team's settings. To pause a project manually or with a webhook you can use the [REST API](https://vercel.com/docs/rest-api/endpoints#pause-a-project):\n\n1.  Ensure you have [access token](https://vercel.com/docs/rest-api#creating-an-access-token) scoped to your team to authenticate the API\n2.  Create a webhook that calls the pause project [endpoint](https://vercel.com/docs/rest-api/endpoints#pause-a-project):\n    *   You'll need to pass a path parameter of the [Project ID](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/overview#project-id) and query string of [Team ID](https://vercel.com/docs/accounts/create-a-team#find-your-team-id):\n        \n        ```\n        https://api.vercel.com/v1/projects/<prj_ID>/pause?teamId=<team_ID>\n        ```\n        \n    *   Use your access token as the bearer token, to enable you to carry out actions through the API on behalf of your team\n    *   Ensure that your `Content-Type` header is set to `application/json`\n\nWhen you pause your project, any users accessing your production deployment will see a [503 DEPLOYMENT\\_PAUSED error](https://vercel.com/docs/errors/DEPLOYMENT_PAUSED).\n\nResuming a project can either be done through the [REST API](https://vercel.com/docs/rest-api/endpoints/projects#unpause-a-project) or your project settings:\n\n1.  Go to your team's [dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard) and select your project. When you select it, you should notice it has a paused icon in the scope selector\n2.  Select the Settings tab\n3.  You'll be presented with a banner notifying you that your project is paused and your production deployment is unavailable\n4.  Select the Resume Service button\n5.  In the dialog that appears, confirm that you want to resume service of your project's production deployment by selecting the Resume button\n\nYour production deployment will resume service within a few minutes. You do not need to redeploy it.\n\nDeleting your project will also delete the deployments and domains within it. If you have any deployments that are assigned to a custom domain and do not want them to be removed, make sure to deploy and assign them to the custom domain under a different project first.\n\nTo delete a project, choose a project from the [dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard), then select the Settings tab.\n\nAt the bottom of the General page, you’ll see the Delete Project section.

    "markdown": "# Builds\n\nWhen you create a new project or push a new commit to a project on Vercel, you initiate a deployment. A deployment is made up of a few steps:\n\nThis guide is focused on the build step, where Vercel validates and builds your source code, outputting all assets into storage.\n\nFor any of the [supported frameworks](https://vercel.com/docs/frameworks/more-frameworks), Vercel will [automatically configure](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/configure-a-build#framework-preset) the build settings with the most common configurations for the framework. If you have specific settings, you can [configure](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/configure-a-build) the [build](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/configure-a-build#build-command), [output](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/configure-a-build#output-directory), and environment variables when you create a new Vercel project or within your project's settings.\n\nIf your project does not require building, for example, a website with only static source files, you can choose to [skip the build step](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/configure-a-build#skip-build-step).\n\nYou can initiate a Vercel deployment in two ways: with [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/docs/cli) or by pushing changes to a connected [Git repository](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/git) on GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket. It's also possible for deployments to be initiated through an integration using [Vercel REST API](https://vercel.com/docs/rest-api).\n\nDepending on how you initiate the build, Vercel may put it in a queue to ensure we build things in the right order and only build the most recent deployment.\n\n![](https://vercel.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.vercel.com%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1689795055%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Fconcepts%2Fdeployments%2Fbuild-step%2Finfra-light.png&w=3840&q=75&dpl=dpl_6RGLzPaeBNhuWHRxN1xTYtAhKUa3)![](https://vercel.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.vercel.com%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1689795055%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Fconcepts%2Fdeployments%2Fbuild-step%2Finfra-dark.png&w=3840&q=75&dpl=dpl_6RGLzPaeBNhuWHRxN1xTYtAhKUa3)\n\nA deployment from CLI triggers a build in the build container which provisions resources and updates the deployment's status\n\n1.  Once you trigger a deployment, the build container will receive a request that there is a job available. The build container is a [Docker container](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container/) that uses an Amazon Linux based image and includes some [pre-installed packages](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/build-image#pre-installed-packages). The build container runs in a few [regions](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/regions) on our Edge Network⁠—you can determine which one by viewing your build logs.\n    \n2.  Vercel first authenticates and inspects the request to confirm its authenticity and your permission to create the deployment to protect against unauthorized access and loss of integrity. At this point, Vercel also validates the Vercel configuration in the [vercel.json](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/project-configuration) file.\n    \n3.  Depending on whether your [plan](https://vercel.com/pricing) allows for [concurrent builds](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/concurrent-builds#usage-and-limits), Vercel may queue your build until other builds from your team have been completed.\n    \n4.  If you use Git to initiate your deployment, Vercel performs a shallow clone on your Git repository to fetch the most recent Git commit history. CLI deployments won't do this step—they'll follow the flow in the next step.\n    \n5.  If you use Vercel CLI to initiate your deployment, the following flow will happen. Git deployments won't go through this flow:\n    \n    *   A POST request is made containing the project’s files to be uploaded (without [these ignored files](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/build-features#ignored-files-and-folders)) to a scalable, secure, and highly durable data storage service\n    *   Once the source files have been uploaded, another POST request is made to start the build and deployment process.\n6.  Vercel will check for an existing build cache key. If it finds one, it will restore the previous build cache. For more information on the build cache, see the \"[Caching process](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/troubleshoot-a-build#caching-process)\" docs.\n    \n7.  Now that the build container has your source files, it [installs any necessary tools](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/configure-a-build#install-command) and then will do the actual build by [running the build command](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/configure-a-build#build-command).\n    \n    During this phase, the build step transforms the project into a Vercel deployment by executing a builder (or multiple builders, depending on the frameworks) on the source code. The builder can be an internal one provided by Vercel (for example, [Next.js builder](https://github.com/vercel/vercel/tree/main/packages/next)) or a [custom builder](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/project-configuration#functions) that requires installation from an npm registry. If this npm registry is private, see \"[Private npm packages](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/build-features#private-npm-packages)\".\n    \n8.  Concurrently, while the build container processes the file, it pings an API endpoint that keeps track of the deployment’s status. Vercel will then use this endpoint to update you on the dashboard, in the CLI, or in your pull request about the live status of the build.\n    \n9.  The build container creates a [build output](https://vercel.com/docs/build-output-api/v3) that runs on one of Vercel's [supported runtimes](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/serverless-functions/runtimes) and provisions resources such as:\n    \n    *   [Serverless Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/serverless-functions) for handling API routes and server-side rendered pages\n    *   [Edge Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/edge-functions) for Middleware and other functions using the edge runtime\n    *   [Optimized Images](https://vercel.com/docs/image-optimization)\n    *   Static output\n    \n    You can check the detailed output from your build on the [deployment summary](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/overview#deployment-summary).\n    \n10.  Finally, once the resources have been created and provisioned, Vercel uploads them to a dedicated static storage, along with metadata that is used to route the user to the correct location on the network. To learn more about what happens when a user requests these resources, see \"[Behind the scenes of Vercel's infrastructure - Request phase](https://vercel.com/blog/behind-the-scenes-of-vercels-infrastructure#request-phase)\".\n    \n\nThe maximum duration of the build is 45 minutes. When the limit is reached, the build will be interrupted and the deployment will fail. For more information, see \"[Cancelled Builds due to limits](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/troubleshoot-a-build#cancelled-builds-due-to-limits)\".\n\nThe build container is created with a specific amount of [resources](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/troubleshoot-a-build#build-container-resources) that cannot be increased.\n\nEach build's cache can be a maximum of 1 GB and applies at the level of each [build cache key](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/troubleshoot-a-build#caching-process). The build cache is retained for one month and currently you cannot configure [which files are cached](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/troubleshoot-a-build#what-is-cached).\n\nThis section details our [improved infrastructure pricing](https://vercel.com/blog/improved-infrastructure-pricing). On April 25, 2024, these changes will apply to all new Pro customers. Starting May 25, 2024, current Pro customers will see these changes take effect on their next billing cycle.

    "markdown": "# Deploying to Vercel\n\nA Vercel Deployment results from a successful build of your [Project](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/overview).\n\nWhen you create a deployment, Vercel automatically adds a new and unique [Generated URL](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/generated-urls). You can visit this URL to preview your changes in a live environment.\n\nYou can also enable visitors to leave feedback on your Deployments with by adding [the Vercel Toolbar package](https://vercel.com/docs/workflow-collaboration/comments/in-production-and-localhost) to your projects. Learn more about the Vercel Toolbar below.\n\nYou can deploy your projects to Vercel in four different ways:\n\n*   [Git](#git)\n*   [Vercel CLI](#vercel-cli)\n*   [Deploy Hooks](#deploy-hooks)\n*   [Vercel REST API](#vercel-rest-api)\n\nThe most common way to create a Deployment on Vercel is through pushing code to [Git](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/git) repositories.\n\nCreating an automatic Deployment begins by [importing a Git repository on Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/git#deploying-a-git-repository). This repository can either be private or public. To setup a Git repository, click the [New Project](https://vercel.com/new) button from the Vercel dashboard and select one of the following Git providers:\n\nDeploying your application using Vercel's Git integration gives you:\n\n*   Simplified collaboration through pull requests or merge requests\n*   The ability to test new features and changes using [Preview Deployments](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/preview-deployments) before merging to the `main` branch to automatically create a [Production Deployment](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/environments#production)\n*   The ability to [receive live feedback in preview environments with the Comments feature](https://vercel.com/docs/workflow-collaboration/comments) (on supported Git providers).\n\nYou can also [create deployments from a Git reference](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/git#creating-a-deployment-from-a-git-reference) directly from the Vercel Dashboard. This is useful when you need to deploy specific commits or the latest changes from a branch, especially during times when automatic deployments might be disrupted.\n\nLearn more with our [Deploying a Git repository guide](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/git#deploying-a-git-repository).\n\nIf you want to initiate Deployments based on external events in your Git repo, you can use [Deploy Hooks](#deploy-hooks).\n\n[Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/docs/cli) allows you to deploy your [Projects](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/overview) directly from the Command Line Interface (CLI). You can use this deployment method whether your project is connected to a Git repository or not.\n\nFor a new Project, the first deploy will ask to [link](https://vercel.com/docs/cli/project-linking) your local directory to the Vercel Project. This is done by running the `vercel` command in your local project directory.\n\nMaking an initial deployment with the `vercel` command.\n\nUpon creating the first Deployment for a Project, the `vercel` command creates a [Production Deployment](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/environments#production).\n\nAfter running this command, a `.vercel` directory is added at the root of your project folder. It contains both the organization and project `ID`. Vercel CLI automatically [detects the framework](https://vercel.com/docs/cli/project-linking#framework-detection) your project is using.\n\nAfter the initial step, you can run the `vercel` command again to create a [Preview Deployment](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/preview-deployments). To create a Production Deployment, use the `vercel --prod` command.\n\nMaking a Production Deployment with the `vercel` command.\n\nYou can use the Vercel CLI to create [custom CI/CD workflows](https://vercel.com/guides/how-can-i-use-github-actions-with-vercel) and integrate into your existing pipelines.\n\nFurther, when using `vercel build` and `vercel deploy --prebuilt`, you can prevent giving access to source code by only uploading the generated build outputs to Vercel.\n\nSee the [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/docs/cli) documentation for other configuration options and more information.\n\n[Deploy Hooks](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/deploy-hooks) are another way of creating Deployments on Vercel. However, a connection to a [Git](#git) repository is still necessary in order to use Deploy Hooks.\n\nThe Deploy Hooks method is useful when the changes in an application depend on external events. If these changes are related to content and are made directly in a [Headless Content Management System (CMS)](https://vercel.com/guides/using-a-headless-cms-with-vercel) or database, you may want to trigger Deployments without touching code. For example, you may want to trigger a deployment when a new blog post is published or when an existing blog post is updated.\n\nTo use this deployment method, you have to generate a URL that accepts HTTP `GET` or `POST` requests to trigger Deployments and re-run the Build Step without needing to push a new git commit. The URL generated is unique for every project.\n\nSee the [Deploy Hooks documentation](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/deploy-hooks) for more information.\n\nThe Vercel REST API is used to create Deployments by making an HTTP `POST` request to the relevant endpoint. The request's body will include all the files you want to deploy. You will have to [generate a `SHA` for each file](https://vercel.com/guides/how-do-i-generate-an-sha-for-uploading-a-file-to-the-vercel-api) and upload using the Vercel REST API.\n\nThis deployment method is helpful for projects that use a custom workflow and add custom domains to a [multi-tenant application](https://vercel.com/guides/nextjs-multi-tenant-application#6.-add-custom-domains-with-the-vercel-api) or integrate a third-party service that is not currently supported by the Vercel platform.\n\nFind more information about the Vercel REST API endpoint in the [API reference](https://vercel.com/docs/rest-api/endpoints#create-a-new-deployment).\n\nWhen you deploy your website to Vercel, the platform generates multiple outputs as a result of your [build](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/builds#build-process). Those outputs could be:\n\n*   [Edge Middleware](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/edge-middleware)\n*   Static Assets (e.g. HTML, CSS, JavaScript files)\n*   Functions ([Serverless Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/serverless-functions) or [Edge Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/edge-functions))\n*   [ISR Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/incremental-static-regeneration)\n\nThe deployment summary provides a detailed overview of all these outputs, organized by the type. You can use this summary to understand the output of your build and determine what's being deployed.\n\nTo access the deployment summary, select your deployment from your project's Deployment tab. Under Deployment Status, expand the Deployment Summary tab.\n\n![Example of an open deployment summary.](https://vercel.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.vercel.com%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1689795055%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Fconcepts%2Fdeployments%2Fdeploy-outputs-light.png&w=3840&q=75&dpl=dpl_6RGLzPaeBNhuWHRxN1xTYtAhKUa3)![Example of an open deployment summary.](https://vercel.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.vercel.com%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1689795055%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Fconcepts%2Fdeployments%2Fdeploy-outputs-dark.png&w=3840&q=75&dpl=dpl_6RGLzPaeBNhuWHRxN1xTYtAhKUa3)\n\nExample of an open deployment summary.\n\nIn the deployment summary, you can see a list of all the artifacts generated from your build and specific information about them.\n\n*   Edge Middleware: [matcher](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/edge-middleware/middleware-api#match-paths-based-on-custom-matcher-config)\n*   Static Assets: name and size\n*   Functions: type, name, runtime, size and region\n*   ISR Functions: name, runtime, size and region.

This shows information on all projects that you have on Vercel, regardless of status.\n\nDepending on the scope that has been selected, you'll be able to view all projects belonging to either your Personal Account or a Team account.\n\nIntegrations allow you to extend the capabilities of Vercel and connect with third-party platforms or services. Users and Teams on all plans can use or create Integrations.\n\nThrough the Integrations section on the dashboard, you can [view and manage a list of all integrations](https://vercel.com/docs/integrations/install-an-integration#manage-integrations) on your account, browse the marketplace to [install integrations](https://vercel.com/docs/integrations/create-integration), or go to the [Integrations Console](https://vercel.com/dashboard/integrations/console) to [create your own Integration](https://vercel.com/docs/integrations/create-integration).\n\nThe Activity Log provides a list of all events on a Hobby account or Team, chronologically organized since its creation. The [events](https://vercel.com/docs/observability/activity-log#events-logged) that you will see are dependant on the type of account and [role within a Team](https://vercel.com/docs/accounts/team-members-and-roles).\n\nThe recent previews panel gives you a quick way to access recently deployed and viewed previews within your teams. It's scoped to the team you are actively viewing.\n\nEach listed preview shows the latest deployment ID and status. Any associated pull request to your git provider is also shown or the relevant git branch.\n\nSelecting a preview from the list will navigate to the live preview.\n\nYou can also navigate to related items for a preview deployment:\n\n*   The associated pull request or code repository page by clicking the label that will have the word \"Code\" or the pull request ID\n*   The deployment details by clicking the label with the deployment ID and status icon\n\nEach preview deployment item also has a context menu where you can see further details and also remove the listing.\n\nBy default, all deployments are assigned a domain with the suffix: `.vercel.app`. This domain can be replaced with a Custom Domain of your choice.\n\nThe Domains section of the dashboard lets you view all domains related to your account or Team, and allows you to Buy, Add, or Transfer In a custom domain.\n\nThe Usage tab on the Dashboard provides detailed insight into the actual resource usage of all projects relating to your account or Team.\n\nFrom the dashboard, you can filter the usage by billing cycle, date, project, or function.\n\nThere are two different types of settings pages:\n\n*   Personal Account / Team Settings - These settings allow you to manage account details, billing, invoicing, membership, security, and tokens. The options you see will depend on the your scope and permissions.\n*   Project Settings - You can view this by selecting a project in the dashboard and then selecting its settings. From there you can manage project details, domains, integrations, Git, functions, environment variables, and security.\n\nVercel provides a Command Menu that enables you to navigate through the dashboard and perform common actions using only the keyboard.\n\nYou can access the menu using by pressing ⌘ + K on macOS or Ctrl + K on Windows and Linux.

    "markdown": "# Domains Overview\n\nA domain is a user-friendly way of referring to the address access a website on the internet. For example, the domain you're reading this on is `vercel.com`. Domains can be analogous to the address where your house is. When someone sends a letter to your house, they don't need to know exactly _where_ it is, they just need the address and the relevant post office handles routing the letter.\n\nThe system that manages the details about where a site is located on the internet, is known as DNS or the Domain Name System. At its most basic, DNS maps human-readable domain names to computer-friendly IP addresses. When you request a site in your browser, the first step is converting the domain address to an IP address. That process is handled by DNS and called DNS Resolution. Understanding how DNS works is important to ensure that you are configuring your domain correctly.\n\n![](https://vercel.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.vercel.com%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1689795055%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Fconcepts%2Fprojects%2Fcustom-domains%2Fdns-request.png&w=3840&q=75&dpl=dpl_6RGLzPaeBNhuWHRxN1xTYtAhKUa3)\n\nDiagram showing the a basic DNS query.\n\n1.  You enter `vercel.com` in your browser. Your browser will first check its local DNS cache to see if it knows the IP address of `vercel.com`. If it does, it will request the site from that address.\n    \n2.  Your browser initiates a DNS query through a server known as a recursive resolver, usually provided by your ISP or a third-party. The recursive resolver acts as a middleman between the browser and DNS server and is used to increase the speed and efficiency of the resolution process. The resolver will check its cache first to see if it already has the IP address. If it doesn't, it'll request the IP address from a DNS server.\n    \n3.  There is a network of DNS servers, in a hierarchy, located all around the world. The recursive resolver will query in the following pattern:\n    \n    *   At the entrance to the network are 13 root nameservers. These are the servers that will be contacted first. The root server will look at the domain name, and based on the TLD or top-level domain (.com, .co.uk, etc.), will direct the resolver to the correct TLD server.\n    *   The TLD nameservers store information about domain names that belong to the same TLD. For example, when searching for `vercel.com`, once the recursive resolver receives a response from the root nameserver, it will query the `.com` TLD nameserver.\n    *   This TLD server will then respond resolver with details about the authoritative nameserver that has the IP address mapping for `vercel.com` stored in an A record. The authoritative nameserver returns this record to the recursive resolver, which will cache the result and return it to your browser.\n4.  Once your browser has the IP address, an HTTP request is made by the browser to the web server located at that IP address.\n    \n\nThis list is just a general overview and doesn't happen every time. Most of us tend to visit the same sites over and over. Therefore, the request will first check the cache from your browser and then from the recursive resolver, allowing for quicker load times. In addition, this example describes a basic unicast DNS network. In reality, when using Vercel, you're using anycast servers on the Edge Network.\n\nThis overview shows a point of view of a user visiting your site. But what does this look like when you're the developer creating a site?\n\nWhen you've created a Project and deployed it on Vercel, your site lives on Vercel's web servers, which we know to be at the IP address `76.76.21.21`. However, your user's browser doesn't know that. For this reason, the browser will perform a DNS Lookup to retrieve the correct IP mapping to `yoursiteaddress.com` from a DNS server.\n\n![](https://vercel.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.vercel.com%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1689795055%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Fconcepts%2Fprojects%2Fcustom-domains%2Fvercel-dns-request.png&w=3840&q=75&dpl=dpl_6RGLzPaeBNhuWHRxN1xTYtAhKUa3)\n\nDiagram showing the Vercel-hosted query.\n\nThis is where, as a developer, you may have to configure the DNS settings to tell the authoritative server exactly where your site lives. Vercel [guides you through](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/domains/add-a-domain) exactly what information you need to set, within your Dashboard. There are a number of different settings that you should be aware of:\n\n*   DNS records: DNS records are an entry in a database that maps the domain with the IP address, which is then stored on the authoritative server. Some of the most common record types are: CNAME (Canonical name), A (Address), NS (nameserver), and MX (mail exchange). These are all described in more detail in [Working with DNS](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/domains/working-with-dns).\n*   Nameserver: Nameservers are an important part of the DNS. They refer to the _actual_ server that maintains and manages the DNS records. There are three types of nameservers: root nameserver, TLD nameserver, and the authoritative server. You can learn more about using a nameserver with Vercel in [Working with nameservers](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/domains/working-with-nameservers).\n*   SSL Certificates: SSL Certificates are a way to show that there is a secure connection from your domain to your website. These are described in more detail in [Working with SSL certificates](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/domains/working-with-ssl).\n\n### Interested in the Enterprise plan?\n\nContact our sales team to learn more about the Enterprise plan and how it can benefit your team.",

The typical monthly usage guidelines above are still applicable, while extra usage will be automatically charged at the following rates:\n\nTo learn more about Managed Infrastructure on the Pro plan, and how to understand your invoices, see [understanding my invoice.](https://vercel.com/docs/pricing/understanding-my-invoice)\n\nSee the [Pro trial limitations](https://vercel.com/docs/accounts/plans/pro/trials#trial-limitations) section for information on the limits that apply to Pro trials.\n\nThe limit of \"Routes created per Deployment\" encapsulates several options that can be configured on Vercel:\n\n*   If you are using a `vercel.json` configuration file, each [rewrite](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/project-configuration#rewrites), [redirect](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/project-configuration#redirects), or [header](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/project-configuration#headers) is counted as a Route\n*   If you are using the [Build Output API](https://vercel.com/docs/build-output-api/v3), you might configure [routes](https://vercel.com/docs/build-output-api/v3/configuration#routes) for your deployments\n\nNote that most frameworks will create Routes automatically for you. For example, Next.js will create a set of Routes corresponding to your use of [dynamic routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/dynamic-routes), [redirects](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next.config.js/redirects), [rewrites](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next.config.js/rewrites) and [custom headers](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next.config.js/headers).\n\nThe maximum duration of the [Build Step](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/configure-a-build) is 45 minutes. When the limit is reached, the Build Step will be interrupted and the Deployment will fail.\n\nEvery Build is provided with the following resources:\n\n|     | Hobby | Pro | Enterprise |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Memory | 8192 MB | 8192 MB | Custom |\n| Disk space | 23 GB | 23 GB | Custom |\n| CPUs | 2   | 4   | Custom |\n\nEnterprise customers can purchase enhanced builds with larger memory and storage.\n\nFor more information on troubleshooting these, see [Build container resources](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/troubleshoot-a-build#build-container-resources).\n\nThe maximum size of the Build's cache is 1 GB. It is retained for one month and it applies at the level of each [Build cache key](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/troubleshoot-a-build#caching-process).\n\nCheck out [the limits and pricing section](https://vercel.com/docs/observability/monitoring/limits-and-pricing) for more details about the limits of the [Monitoring](https://vercel.com/docs/observability/monitoring) feature on Vercel.\n\nThere are two types of logs: build logs and runtime logs. Both have different behaviors when storing logs.\n\n[Build logs](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/logs) are stored indefinitely for each deployment.\n\n[Runtime logs](https://vercel.com/docs/observability/runtime-logs) are stored for 1 hour on Hobby, 1 day on Pro, and for 3 days on Enterprise accounts. To learn more about these log limits, [read here](https://vercel.com/docs/observability/runtime-logs#limits).\n\nThe maximum number of [Environment Variables](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables) per environment per [Project](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/overview) is `1000`. For example, you cannot have more than `1000` Production Environment Variables.\n\nThe total size of your Environment Variables, names and values, is limited to 64KB for projects using Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go, Java, and .NET runtimes. This limit is the total allowed for each deployment, and is also the maximum size of any single Environment Variable. For more information, see the [Environment Variables](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables#environment-variable-size) documentation.\n\nIf you are using [System Environment Variables](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables/system-environment-variables), the framework-specific ones (i.e. those prefixed by the framework name) are exposed only during the Build Step, but not at runtime. However, the non-framework-specific ones are exposed at runtime. Only the Environment Variables that are exposed at runtime are counted towards the size limit.\n\n|     | Hobby | Pro |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Domains per Project | 50  | Unlimited |\n\nThe maximum number of files that can be uploaded when creating a CLI [Deployment](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/overview) is `15,000` for source files. Deployments that contain more files than the limit will fail at the [build step](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/configure-a-build).\n\nAlthough there is no upper limit for output files created during a build, you can expect longer build times as a result of having many thousands of output files (100,000 or more, for example). If the build time exceeds 45 minutes then the build will fail.\n\nWe recommend using [Incremental Static Regeneration](https://vercel.com/docs/incremental-static-regeneration) (ISR) to help reduce build time. Using ISR will allow you pre-render a subset of the total number of pages at build time, giving you faster builds and the ability to generate pages on-demand.\n\nThe amount of time (in seconds) that a proxied request (`rewrites` or `routes` with an external destination) is allowed to process an HTTP request. The maximum timeout is 30 seconds. If the external server does not reply until the maximum timeout is reached, an error with the message `ROUTER_EXTERNAL_TARGET_ERROR` will be returned.\n\n[Edge Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/serverless-functions) and [Serverless Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/serverless-functions) do not support acting as a WebSocket server.\n\nWe recommend third-party [solutions](https://vercel.com/guides/publish-and-subscribe-to-realtime-data-on-vercel#providers) to enable realtime communication for [Deployments](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/overview).\n\nCheck out the [Limits and Pricing section](https://vercel.com/docs/analytics/limits-and-pricing) for more details about the limits of Vercel Web Analytics.\n\nCheck out the [Limits and Pricing](https://vercel.com/docs/speed-insights/limits-and-pricing) doc for more details about the limits of the Speed Insights feature on Vercel.\n\nCheck out the Cron Jobs [limits](https://vercel.com/docs/cron-jobs/usage-and-pricing) section for more information about the limits of Cron Jobs on Vercel.\n\nThe limits of Vercel functions are based on the [runtime](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/serverless-functions/runtimes) that you use.\n\nFor example, different runtimes allow for different [bundle sizes](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/serverless-functions/runtimes#bundle-size-limits), [maximum duration](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/serverless-functions/runtimes#max-execution-time), and [memory](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/serverless-functions/runtimes#memory-size-limits).\n\n​Vercel does not support connecting your Personal Account's Projects to Git repositories owned by Git organizations. You can either switch to an existing Team or create a new one.\n\nThe same limitation applies in the Project creation flow when importing an existing Git repository or when cloning a Vercel template to a new Git repository as part of your Git organization.\n\nSee the [Reserved Environment Variables](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables/reserved-environment-variables) docs for more information.\n\nRate limits are hard limits that apply to the platform when performing actions that require a response from our [API](https://vercel.com/docs/rest-api#api-basics).\n\nThe rate limits table consists of the following four columns:\n\n*   Description - A brief summary of the limit which, where relevant, will advise what type of plan it applies to.\n*   Limit - The amount of actions permitted within the amount of time (Duration) specified.\n*   Duration - The amount of time (seconds) in which you can perform the specified amount of actions. Once a rate limit is hit, it will be reset after the Duration has expired.\n*   Scope - Who the limit applies to: `owner` refers to the [Personal Account](https://vercel.com/docs/accounts/create-an-account#creating-a-hobby-account) Owner or [Team](https://vercel.com/docs/accounts/create-a-team) Owner, `user` refers to a [Team Member](https://vercel.com/docs/accounts/team-members-and-roles).\n\nBelow are five examples that provide further information on how rate limits work.\n\nYou are able to delete up to `60` domains every `60` seconds (1 minute). Should you hit the rate limit, you will need to wait another minute before you can delete another domain.\n\nYou are able to delete up to `20` teams every `3600` seconds (1 hour). Should you hit the rate limit, you will need to wait another hour before you can delete another team.\n\nYou are able to change your username up to `6` times every `604800` seconds (1 week). Should you hit the rate limit, you will need to wait another week before you can change your username again.\n\nYou are able to build `32` [Deployments](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/overview) every `3600` seconds (1 hour). Should you hit the rate limit, you will need to wait another hour before you can build a deployment again.\n\nUsing Next.js or any similar framework to build your deployment is classed as a build. Each Serverless Function is also classed as a build. Hosting static files such as an index.html file is not classed as a build.\n\nYou are able to deploy `100` times every `86400` seconds (1 day). Should you hit the rate limit, you will need to wait another day before you can deploy again.\n\n* * *",

    "markdown": "# Pricing on Vercel\n\nThis section details our [improved infrastructure pricing](https://vercel.com/blog/improved-infrastructure-pricing). On April 25, 2024, these changes will apply to all new Pro customers. Starting May 25, 2024, current Pro customers will see these changes take effect on their next billing cycle. The Hobby tier remains free.\n\nThis page provides an overview of Vercel's pricing model and outlines all billable metrics and their pricing models.\n\nFor a full breakdown of Vercel's pricing by plan, see the [pricing page](https://vercel.com/pricing/coming-soon).\n\nTo learn how resources are triggered through a real-world app scenario, see the [calculating resource usage](https://vercel.com/docs/pricing/how-does-vercel-calculate-usage-of-resources) guide.\n\nVercel provides [Managed Infrastructure](https://vercel.com/products/managed-infrastructure) to deploy, scale, and secure your applications.\n\nThis includes our [Edge Network](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/overview), [Vercel Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/introduction), and more. These resources are usage based, and billed based on the amount of data transferred, the number of requests made, and the duration of compute resources used.\n\nEach product's usage breaks down into resources, with each one billed based on the usage of a specific metric. For example, within the Edge Network, [Fast Data Transfer](https://vercel.com/docs/pricing/networking#fast-data-transfer) incurs charges based on the data transferred between the user's device and the Vercel Edge Network.\n\nSimilarly, [Function Duration](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/configuring-functions/duration) generates bills based on the total execution time of a Serverless Function.\n\nThe below table lists the billable Managed Infrastructure resources for the following products:\n\nPricing begins at the stated rate for [Pro](https://vercel.com/docs/accounts/plans/pro). The Pro plan add-on badge indicates resources available at an extra cost. For [Enterprise](https://vercel.com/docs/accounts/plans/enterprise) pricing, contact our [sales team](https://vercel.com/contact/sales).\n\nTo learn more about Managed Infrastructure on the Pro plan, and how to understand your invoices, see [understanding my invoice.](https://vercel.com/docs/pricing/understanding-my-invoice)\n\nThe following table lists the pricing for each resource in Managed Infrastructure. Resources that depend on the region of your Vercel project are priced differently based on the cost of resources in that region.\n\nUse the dropdown to select the regional prices.\n\nVercel's Developer Experience Platform [(DX Platform)](https://vercel.com/products/dx-platform) offers a monthly billed suite of tools and services focused on building, deploying, and optimizing web applications.\n\nThe below table lists the billable DX Platform resources for the following products and services:\n\nPricing begins at the stated rate for [Pro](https://vercel.com/docs/accounts/plans/pro). For Pro plan add-ons, a badge indicates which resources can be purchased at additional cost. For [Enterprise](https://vercel.com/docs/accounts/plans/enterprise) pricing, contact our [sales team](https://vercel.com/contact/sales).\n\n### Interested in the Enterprise plan?\n\nContact our sales team to learn more about the Enterprise plan and how it can benefit your team.\n\nFor more information on Vercel's pricing, guidance on optimizing consumption, and invoices, see the following resources:",

    "url": "https://vercel.com/docs/errors/error-list",
    "markdown": "# Error List\n\nThe [build step](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/configure-a-build) will result in an error if the output directory is missing, empty, or invalid (for example, it is not a directory). To resolve this error, you can try the following steps:\n\n*   Make sure the [output directory](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/configure-a-build#output-directory) is specified correctly in project settings\n*   If the output directory is correct, check the build command ([documentation](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/configure-a-build#build-command)) or the [root directory](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/configure-a-build#root-directory))\n*   Try running the build command locally and make sure that the files are correctly generated in the specified output directory\n\nThis is only relevant if you’re using Vercel CLI 16.7.3 or older.\n\nSuppose your project contains a `package.json` file, no `api` directory, and no `vercel.json` configuration. In that case, it is expected to provide a `build` [script](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts) that performs a static build of your frontend and outputs it to a `public` directory at the root of your project.\n\nWhen properly configured, your `package.json` file would look similar to this:\n\n```\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"build\": \"[my-framework] build --output public\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAn example `build` script in a `package.json` file that specifies the output directory.\n\nOnce you have defined the `build` [script](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts), this error will disappear. Furthermore, it will not be displayed if you are using `package.json` purely to provide dependencies for your Serverless Functions located inside the `api` directory.\n\nThe maximum amount of open requests to join a team is 10. In order to allow for more requests, the existing requests need to be approved or declined by a [Team Owner](https://vercel.com/docs/accounts/team-members-and-roles/access-roles#owner-role).\n\nThis ensures the list always remains manageable and protected against spam.\n\nIf a user has already requested access to a team, it's impossible to invite them. Instead, their request must be approved by a [Team Owner](https://vercel.com/docs/accounts/team-members-and-roles/access-roles#owner-role) for the user to gain access.\n\nThis ensures no team invites are accidentally accepted.\n\nWhen the deployment for a commit fails with the message \"Team access required to deploy.\", the Git account of the commit author is not connected to a Hobby account that is a member of the team.\n\nThe link attached to the error allows someone to connect their Hobby account to the Git account of the commit author. If the Hobby account is connected to a different Git account, it will fail stating that a different Git account must be used to request access to the team.\n\nOnce the Git account is connected to the Hobby account on Vercel, it is possible to request access to the team. A [Team Owner](https://vercel.com/docs/accounts/team-members-and-roles/access-roles#owner-role) can then approve or decline this access request. If the request was approved, the failed commit would be retried, and the following commits would not fail due to missing team access.\n\nA Hobby or team on Vercel can be blocked if it violates our [fair use guidelines](https://vercel.com/docs/limits/fair-use-guidelines) or [Terms of Service](https://vercel.com/legal/terms).\n\nBlocked Hobby accounts or teams cannot create new deployments, or be invited to new teams. Please [contact Vercel Support](https://vercel.com/help#issues) if you need help.\n\nA [Project](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/overview) has several settings that can be found in the dashboard. One of those sections, Build & Development Settings, is used to change the way a Project is built.\n\nHowever, the Build & Development Settings are only applied to [zero-configuration](https://vercel.com/guides/upgrade-to-zero-configuration) deployments.\n\nIf a deployment defines the [`builds`](https://vercel.com/docs/cli#project-configuration/builds) configuration property, the Build & Development Settings are ignored.\n\nA [Project](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/overview) has several settings that can be found in the dashboard. One of those settings, Serverless Function Region, is used to select the [region](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/regions) where your Serverless Functions execute.\n\nIf a deployment defines the [`regions`](https://vercel.com/docs/cli#project-configuration/regions) configuration property in `vercel.json`, the Serverless Function Region setting is ignored.\n\nIf a CLI Deployment defines the [`--regions`](https://vercel.com/docs/cli/deploy#regions) option, the Serverless Function Region setting is ignored.\n\nThe `source` property follows the syntax from [path-to-regexp](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/tree/v6.1.0), not the `RegExp` syntax.\n\nFor example, negative lookaheads must be wrapped in a group.\n\nBefore\n\n```\n{\n  \"source\": \"/feedback/(?!general)\",\n  \"destination\": \"/api/feedback/general\"\n}\n```\n\nAfter\n\n```\n{\n  \"source\": \"/feedback/((?!general).*)\",\n  \"destination\": \"/api/feedback/general\"\n}\n```\n\nThe `source` property follows the syntax from [path-to-regexp](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/tree/v6.1.0).\n\nA colon (`:`) defines the start of a [named segment parameter](https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/tree/v6.1.0#named-parameters).\n\nA named segment parameter defined in the `destination` property must also be defined in the `source` property.\n\nBefore\n\n```\n{\n  \"source\": \"/feedback/:type\",\n  \"destination\": \"/api/feedback/:id\"\n}\n```\n\nAfter\n\n```\n{\n  \"source\": \"/feedback/:id\",\n  \"destination\": \"/api/feedback/:id\"\n}\n```\n\nWhen running the `vercel build` or `vercel dev` commands, `npm install` errors can be encountered if `npm` was invoked to install Builders that are defined in your `vercel.json` file.\n\n`npm install` may fail if:\n\n*   [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) is not installed\n*   Your internet connection is unavailable\n*   The Builder that is defined in your configuration is not published to the npm registry\n\nDouble-check that the name and version of the Builder you are requesting is correct.\n\nIf you have [`rewrites`](https://vercel.com/docs/cli#project-configuration/rewrites), [`redirects`](https://vercel.com/docs/cli#project-configuration/redirects), [`headers`](https://vercel.com/docs/cli#project-configuration/headers), [`cleanUrls`](https://vercel.com/docs/cli#project-configuration/clean-urls) or [`trailingSlash`](https://vercel.com/docs/cli#project-configuration/trailing-slash) defined in your [configuration](https://vercel.com/docs/project-configuration) file, then [`routes`](https://vercel.com/docs/cli#project-configuration/routes) cannot be defined.\n\nThis is a necessary limitation because `routes` is a lower-level primitive that contains all of the other types. Therefore, it cannot be merged safely with the new properties.\n\nSee the [Upgrading Routes](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/project-configuration#upgrading-legacy-routes) section for examples of `routes` compared to the new properties.\n\nFor backward compatibility purposes, there are two naming conventions for configuration files used by Vercel CLI (for example `vercel.json` and `now.json`). Both naming conventions are supported, however only _one_ may be defined at a time. Vercel CLI will output an error message if both naming conventions are used at the same time.\n\nThese conflicting configuration errors occur if:\n\n*   Both `vercel.json` and `now.json` exist in your project.  \n    Solution: Delete the `now.json` file\n*   Both `.vercel` and `.now` directories exist in your project.  \n    Solution: Delete the `.now` directory\n*   Both `.vercelignore` and `.nowignore` files exist in your project.  \n    Solution: Delete the `.nowignore` file\n*   Environment Variables that begin with `VERCEL_` have a conflicting Environment Variable that begins with `NOW_`.  \n    Solution: Only define the `VERCEL_` prefixed Environment Variable\n\nThere are two ways to configure Serverless Functions in your project: [functions](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/project-configuration#functions) _or_ [`builds`](https://vercel.com/docs/cli#project-configuration/builds). However, only one of them may be used at a time - they cannot be used in conjunction.\n\nFor most cases, it is recommended to use the `functions` property because it supports more features, such as:\n\n*   Allows configuration of the amount of memory that the Serverless Function is provided with\n*   More reliable because it requires a specific npm package version for the `runtime` property\n*   Supports \"clean URLs\" by default, which means that the Serverless Functions are automatically accessible without their file extension in the URL\n\nHowever, the [`builds`](https://vercel.com/docs/cli#project-configuration/builds) property will remain supported for backward compatibility purposes.\n\nWhen using Next.js, only `memory` and `maxDuration` can be configured within the [functions](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/project-configuration#functions) property. Next.js automatically handles the other configuration values for you.\n\nIt's possible to deploy Serverless Functions to multiple regions. This functionality is only available to [Enterprise teams](https://vercel.com/docs/accounts/plans/enterprise).\n\nOn the [Pro plan](https://vercel.com/docs/accounts/plans/pro), the limitation has existed since the [launch](https://vercel.com/blog/simpler-pricing) of the current pricing model but was applied on July 10, 2020. For Projects created on or after the date, it's no longer possible to deploy to multiple regions.\n\nTo select the region closest to you, read our [guide](https://vercel.com/guides/choosing-deployment-regions) on choosing deployment regions for Serverless Functions.\n\nThe [functions](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/project-configuration#functions) property uses a glob pattern for each key. This pattern must match Serverless Function source files within the `api` directory.\n\nIf you are using Next.js, Serverless Functions source files can be created in the following:\n\n*   `pages/api` directory\n*   `src/pages/api` directory\n*   `pages` directory when the module exports [getServerSideProps](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/get-server-side-props)\n*   `src/pages` directory when the module exports [getServerSideProps](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/get-server-side-props)\n\nAdditionally, if you'd like to use a Serverless Function that isn't written with Node.js, and in combination with Next.js, you can place it in the `api` directory (provided by the platform), since `pages/api` (provided by Next.js) only supports JavaScript.\n\nNot Allowed\n\n```\n{\n  \"functions\": {\n    \"users/**/*.js\": {\n      \"maxDuration\": 30\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAllowed\n\n```\n{\n  \"functions\": {\n    \"api/users/**/*.js\": {\n      \"maxDuration\": 30\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAllowed (Next.js)\n\n```\n{\n  \"functions\": {\n    \"pages/api/users/**/*.js\": {\n      \"maxDuration\": 30\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIf the Project configuration in `.vercel` belongs to a team you are not a member of, attempting to deploy the project will result in an error.\n\nThis can occur if you clone a Git repository that includes the `.vercel` directory, or you are logged in to the wrong Vercel account.\n\nTo fix, remove the `.vercel` directory and redeploy to link the project again by running these commands.\n\nOn macOS and Linux:\n\nOn Windows:\n\nrmdir /s /q .vercel\n\nvercel\n\nProject names can only consist of up to one hundred alphanumeric lowercase characters. Hyphens can be used in between words in the name, but never at the start or end.\n\nThe amount of Vercel Projects that can be connected with the same Git repository is [limited depending on your plan](https://vercel.com/docs/limits/overview#general-limits).\n\nIf you have reached the limitation and would like to connect a new project to the repository, you will need to disconnect an existing project from the same Git repository.\n\nTo increase this limit, please [contact our Sales Team](https://vercel.com/contact/sales).\n\nTo verify your domain, point the domain to Vercel by configuring our nameservers or a DNS Record. You can learn more about what to do for your Domain by running `vercel domains inspect <domain>`, where `<domain>` is the domain you're interested in.\n\nAlternatively, if you already added the domain to a project, read [the configuring a domain section](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/custom-domains#step-4:-configuring-the-domain) of the custom domain documentation.\n\nYou cannot leave a team if you are the last remaining [Owner](https://vercel.com/docs/accounts/team-members-and-roles/access-roles#owner-role) or the last confirmed [Member](https://vercel.com/docs/accounts/team-members-and-roles/access-roles#member-role). In order to leave the Team, first designate a different confirmed [Member](https://vercel.com/docs/accounts/team-members-and-roles/access-roles#member-role) to be an [Team Owner](https://vercel.com/docs/accounts/team-members-and-roles/access-roles#owner-role).\n\nIf you are the only remaining [Member](https://vercel.com/docs/accounts/team-members-and-roles/access-roles#member-role), you should instead delete the Team.\n\nDeployments created using Vercel CLI will automatically [ignore several files](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/build-features#ignored-files-and-folders) for security and performance reasons.\n\nHowever, these files are _not_ ignored for deployments created using [Git](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/git) and a warning is printed instead. This is because `.gitignore` determines which files should be ignored.\n\nIf the file was intentionally committed to Git, you can ignore the warning.\n\nIf the file was accidentally committed to Git, you can remove it using the following commands:\n\n```\ngit rm file.txt                   # remove the file\necho 'file.txt' >> .gitignore     # append file to .gitignore\ngit add .gitignore                # stage the change\ngit commit -m \"Removed file.txt\"  # commit the change\ngit push                          # deploy the change\n```\n\nIn some cases, signing up with GitHub fails due to GitHub's database inconsistencies.\n\nWhen you connected your Hobby account with your GitHub account, the [Vercel GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/vercel) was installed on your GitHub account and then GitHub notified Vercel that the app was successfully installed.\n\nHowever, Vercel was unable to retrieve the app installation from GitHub, which made it appear as if the [Vercel GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/vercel) was never installed.\n\nIn order to solve this issue, wait a couple of minutes and try connecting to GitHub again. If you are still unable to connect, please contact [GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact) to determine why the [Vercel GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/vercel) was not able to be installed.\n\nIf you have configured a custom Git branch for a domain or an environment variable, it is considered a preview domain and a preview environment variable. Because of this, the Git branch configured for it is considered a [preview branch](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/git#preview-branches).\n\nWhen configuring the production branch in the project settings, it is not possible to use a preview branch.\n\nIf you still want to use this particular Git branch as a production branch, please follow these steps:\n\n1.  Assign your affected domains to the production environment (clear out the Git branch you've defined for them)\n2.  Assign your affected environment variables to the production environment (clear out the Git branch you've defined for them)\n\nAfterwards, you can use the Git branch you originally wanted to use as a production branch.\n\nIn order for Vercel to be able to deploy commits to your Git repository, a Project on Vercel has to be connected to it.\n\nThis connection is interrupted if the Git repository is deleted, archived, or if the Vercel App was uninstalled from the corresponding Git account or Git organization. Make sure none of these things apply.\n\nAdditionally, when using GitHub, the connection is also interrupted if you or a [Team Member](https://vercel.com/docs/accounts/team-members-and-roles/access-roles#member-role) modifies the access permissions of the Vercel GitHub App installed on the respective personal GitHub account or GitHub organization.\n\nTo verify the access permissions of the Vercel GitHub App installed on your personal GitHub account, navigate to the [Applications page](https://github.com/settings/installations) and select Vercel under Installed GitHub Apps. You will see a list of Git repositories that the GitHub App has access to. Make sure that the Git repository you're looking to connect to a Vercel Project is listed there.\n\nTo verify the access permissions of the Vercel GitHub App installed on your GitHub organization, select Vercel under Installed GitHub Apps in the organization settings. You will see a list of Git repositories that the GitHub App has access to. Make sure that the Git repository you're looking to connect to a Vercel Project is listed there.\n\nYou cannot redeploy a production deployment if a more recent one exists.\n\nThe reason is that redeploying an old production deployment would result in overwriting the most recent source code you have deployed to production.\n\nTo force an explicit overwrite of the current production deployment, select Promote instead.\n\nCertain SSL Certificates associated with your Hobby account or team (i.e. Wildcard SSL Certificates for your Vercel Project's staging domains) are automatically generated by the Vercel platform.\n\nBecause these SSL Certificates are managed by the Vercel platform, they cannot be manually deleted on the Vercel Dashboard – nor through Vercel CLI.\n\nCustom SSL Certificates may be uploaded to teams on the [Enteprise plan](https://vercel.com/docs/accounts/plans/enterprise), which are allowed to be manually deleted.\n\nThe Git branch that is configured using the [production branch](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/git#production-branch) field in the project settings, is considered the branch that contains the code served to your visitors.\n\nIf you'd like to assign a domain or environment variable to that particular Git branch, there's no need to manually fill it in.\n\nBy default, if no custom Git branch is defined for them, domains are already assigned to the production branch. The same is true for environment variables: If no custom Git branch is defined for them and Production is selected as an environment, they're already assigned to the production branch.\n\nIf you still want to enter a specific Git branch for a domain or an environment variable, it has to be a [preview branch](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/git#preview-branches).\n\nThe _\"Command not found\"_ error message happens when a sub-process that `vercel dev` is attempting to create is not installed on your local machine. You need to install the particular program onto your operating system before `vercel dev` will work correctly.\n\nFor example, you may see the error _\"Command not found: go\"_ if you are writing a Serverless Function in Go, but do not have the `go` binary installed. In this case you need to [install `go`](https://golang.org/doc/install) first, and then try invoking your Serverless Function again.\n\nYou have configured one of the following for your Project:\n\n*   The [Build Command](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/configure-a-build#build-command) defined in the Project Settings invokes `vercel build`\n*   The [Development Command](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/configure-a-build#development-command) defined in the Project Settings invokes `vercel dev`\n\nBecause the Build Command is invoked by `vercel build` when deploying, it cannot invoke `vercel build` itself, as that would cause an infinite recursion.\n\nThe same applies to the Development Command: When developing locally, `vercel dev` invokes the Development Command, so it cannot invoke `vercel dev` itself.\n\nAdjust the Build and Development Commands defined for your Project to not invoke `vercel build` or `vercel dev`.\n\nInstead, they should invoke the Build Command provided by your framework.\n\nIf you are unsure about which value to provide, disable the Override option in order to default to the preferred settings for the [Framework Preset](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/configure-a-build#framework-preset) you have selected.\n\n`ERR_PNPM_UNSUPPORTED_ENGINE` occurs when `package.json#engines.pnpm` does not match the currently running version of `pnpm`.\n\nTo fix, do one of the following:\n\n*   [Set the env var `ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_COREPACK` to 1](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/configure-a-build#corepack), and make sure the `packageManager` value is set correctly in your `package.json`\n\n```\n{\n  \"engines\": {\n    \"pnpm\": \"^7.5.1\"\n  },\n  \"packageManager\": \"pnpm@7.5.1\"\n}\n```\n\n*   Remove the [`engines.pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/package_json#engines) value from your `package.json`\n\nYou cannot use [`engine-strict`](https://pnpm.io/npmrc#engine-strict) to solve this error. `engine-strict` only handles dependencies.\n\nThis error occurs when attempting to create a deployment where at least one of its environment variables contains an outdated Edge Config connection string. A connection string can be outdated if either the Edge Config itself was deleted or if the token used in the connection string is invalid or has been deleted.\n\nTo resolve this error, delete or update the environment variable that contains the connection string. In most cases, the environment variable is named `EDGE_CONFIG`.\n\nYou must reference `@vercel/speed-insights` or `@vercel/analytics` packages in your application's `package.json` file. This error occurs when you deploy your application with these packages globally available, but not referenced in your `package.json` file, like in a monorepo.\n\nTo fix this error, add the packages to your `package.json` file as a dependency.",

These docs will teach how to optimize your apps and deployment configuration to get the best performance for your use-case.\n\n![An overview of how items relate to the Edge Network](https://vercel.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.vercel.com%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1712323807%2Ffront%2Fdocs%2Fpricing%2Fpricing-blog-light.png&w=3840&q=75&dpl=dpl_6RGLzPaeBNhuWHRxN1xTYtAhKUa3)![An overview of how items relate to the Edge Network](https://vercel.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.vercel.com%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1712323806%2Ffront%2Fdocs%2Fpricing%2Fpricing-infradark.png&w=3840&q=75&dpl=dpl_6RGLzPaeBNhuWHRxN1xTYtAhKUa3)\n\nAn overview of how items relate to the Edge Network\n\nVercel's Edge Network uses routing rules to determine how to handle incoming requests, set headers, and cache responses. The following can be configured through [Vercel Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/functions) or the [`vercel.json`](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/project-configuration) configuration file:\n\n*   [Redirects](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/redirects): Redirects are used to tell the client to make a new request to a different URL, useful for enforcing HTTPS, redirecting users, and directing traffic\n*   [Rewrites](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/rewrites): Rewrites internally change the URL the server uses to fetch the requested resource, allowing for dynamic content and improved routing\n*   [Headers](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/headers): Headers are used to modify the request and response headers, allowing for improved security, performance, and functionality\n\nVercel's Edge Network stores content and runs compute in many regions around the world for optimal performance.\n\nVercel's Edge Network caches your content at the edge in order to serve data to your users as fast as possible.\n\nVercel's Edge Network supports streaming API responses with Edge and Serverless Functions. Streaming data enables you to improve your users' perception of your app's speed and performance.\n\nAside from routing your requests to the correct destination, the Edge Network also takes care of a few other important aspects of a working Deployment:\n\nAll of these actions are performed automatically with careful attention to performance (ensured by our choices of technology). In turn, we highly recommend not implementing SSL termination or compression in your own code, as it would be unnecessary.\n\nThe Edge Network supports the following protocols (negotiated with [ALPN](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7301)):\n\nVercel supports of 35 [frontend frameworks](https://vercel.com/docs/frameworks). These frameworks provide a local development environment used to test your app before deploying to Vercel.\n\nThrough [framework-defined infrastructure](https://vercel.com/blog/framework-defined-infrastructure), Vercel then transforms your framework build outputs into globally [managed infrastructure](https://vercel.com/products/managed-infrastructure) for production.\n\nIf you are using [Vercel Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/serverless-functions) or other compute on Vercel _without_ a framework, you can use the [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/docs/cli) to test your code locally with [`vercel dev`](https://vercel.com/docs/cli/dev).\n\nWhile sometimes necessary, proceed with caution when you place another CDN in front of Vercel:\n\n*   Vercel's Edge Network is designed to deploy new releases of your site without downtime by purging the Edge Network cache globally and replacing the current deployment\n*   If you use an additional CDN in front of Vercel, it can cause issues because Vercel has no control over the other provider, leading to the serving of stale content or returning 404 errors\n*   To avoid these problems while still using another CDN, we recommend you either configure a short cache time or disabling the cache entirely. Check the documentation for your preferred CDN to learn how to do either option\n\nThis section details our [improved infrastructure pricing](https://vercel.com/blog/improved-infrastructure-pricing). On April 25, 2024, these changes will apply to all new Pro customers. Starting May 25, 2024, current Pro customers will see these changes take effect on their next billing cycle.

    "url": "https://vercel.com/docs/vercel-platform/private-registry",
    "markdown": "# Working with Vercel's private registry\n\nVercel distributes packages with the `@vercel-private` scope through our private npm registry, requiring authentication through a Vercel account for each user.\n\nAccess to `@vercel-private` packages is linked to access to products. If you have trouble accessing a package, please check that you have access to the corresponding Vercel product.\n\n1.  If you're the first person on your team to use Vercel's private registry, you'll need to set up your workspace to fetch packages from the private registry.\n    \n    Execute the following command to configure your package manager to fetch packages with the `@vercel-private` scope from the private registry. Note that you can run this command with any package manager, such as `npm`, `yarn`, or `pnpm`. If you're using modern Yarn (v2 or newer) see the [Using modern versions of Yarn](#setting-registry-server-using-modern-versions-of-yarn) section below.\n    \n    ```\n    npm config set --location=project @vercel-private:registry \"https://vercel-private-registry.vercel.sh/registry\"\n    ```\n    \n    This command creates an `.npmrc` file (or updates one if it exists) at the root of your workspace. We recommend committing this file to your repository, as it will help other engineers get on board faster.\n    \n    Yarn version 2 or newer ignores the `.npmrc` config file so you will need to use this command instead to add the registry to your project's `.yarnrc.yml` file:\n    \n    ```\n    yarn config set npmScopes.vercel-private.npmRegistryServer \"https://vercel-private-registry.vercel.sh/registry\"\n    ```\n    \n2.  Each team member will need to complete this step. It may be helpful to summarize this step in your team's onboarding documentation.\n    \n    To log in, use the following command and follow the prompts:\n    \n    ```\n    npm login --scope=@vercel-private\n    ```\n    \n    The minimum required version of npm to log into the registry is 8.14.0\n    \n    During this process, you will be asked to log in to your Vercel account. Ensure that the account that you log in to has access to the Vercel product(s) that you're trying to install.\n    \n    You should now have a `.npmrc` file in your home directory that contains the authentication token for the private registry.\n    \n    Yarn version 2 or newer requires the authentication token to be saved in a `.yarnrc.yml` file. After running the above command, you can copy the token from the `.npmrc` file with:\n    \n    ```\n    auth_token=$(awk -F'=' '/vercel-private-registry.vercel.sh\\/:_authToken/ {print $2}' $(npm config get userconfig)) \\\n    && yarn config set --home 'npmRegistries[\"https://vercel-private-registry.vercel.sh/registry\"].npmAuthToken' $auth_token\n    ```\n    \n    Note the `--home` flag, which ensures the token is saved in the global `.yarnrc.yml` rather then in your project so that it isn't committed.\n    \n3.  Verify your login status by executing:\n    \n    The Yarn command only works with Yarn version 2 or newer, use the npm command if using Yarn v1.\n    \n    You should see your Vercel username returned if everything is set up correctly.\n    \n4.  When a user tries to install a package from the private registry without first logging in, the error message might be unclear. To help, we suggest adding a pre-install message that provides instructions to those unauthenticated users.\n    \n    Create a `preinstall.mjs` file with your error message:\n    \n    ```\n    import { exec } from 'node:child_process';\n    import { promisify } from 'node:util';\n     \n    const execPromise = promisify(exec);\n     \n    try {\n      await execPromise(\n        `npm whoami --registry=https://vercel-private-registry.vercel.sh/registry`,\n      );\n    } catch (error) {\n      throw new Error(\n        `Please log in to the Vercel private registry to install \\`@vercel-private\\`-scoped packages:\\n\\`npm login --scope=@vercel-private\\``,\n      );\n    }\n    ```\n    \n    Then add the following script to the `scripts` field in your `package.json`:\n    \n    ```\n    {\n      \"scripts\": {\n        \"pnpm:devPreinstall\": \"node preinstall.mjs\"\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n    \n\nNow that your local environment is set up, you can configure Vercel to use the private registry.\n\n1.  Create a [Vercel authentication token](https://vercel.com/docs/rest-api#creating-an-access-token) on the [Tokens](https://vercel.com/account/tokens) page\n2.  To set the newly created token in Vercel, navigate to the [Environment Variables](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables) settings for your Project\n3.  Add a new environment variable with the name `VERCEL_TOKEN`, and set the value to the token you created above. We recommend using a [Sensitive Environmental Variable](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables/sensitive-environment-variables) for storing this token\n4.  Add a new environment variable with the name `NPM_RC`, and set the value to the following:\n\n```\n@vercel-private:registry=https://vercel-private-registry.vercel.sh/registry\n//vercel-private-registry.vercel.sh/:_authToken=${VERCEL_TOKEN}\n```\n\nIf you already have an `NPM_RC` environment variable, you can append the above to that existing value.\n\nVercel should now be able to install packages from the private registry when building your Project.\n\nThe instructions below are for [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), but configuring other CI providers should be similar:\n\n1.  Create a [Vercel authentication token](https://vercel.com/docs/rest-api#creating-an-access-token) on the [Tokens](https://vercel.com/account/tokens) page. For security reasons, you should use a different token from the one you created for Vercel in the previous step\n2.  Once you have a new token, add it as a secret named `VERCEL_TOKEN` to your GitHub repository or organization. To learn more about how to add secrets, [Using secrets in GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions)\n3.  Finally, create a [workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows) for the product you're setting up. The example workflow below is for [Conformance](https://vercel.com/docs/workflow-collaboration/conformance) and assumes that you're using [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as your package manager. In this example we also pass the token to the Conformance CLI, as the same token can be used for CLI authentication\n\n```\nname: Conformance\n \non:\n  pull_request:\n    branches:\n      - main\n \njobs:\n  conformance:\n    name: 'Run Conformance'\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout\n        uses: actions/checkout@v3\n \n      - name: Set up Node.js\n        uses: actions/setup-node@v4\n        with:\n          node-version-file: '.node-version'\n \n      - name: Set up pnpm\n        uses: pnpm/action-setup@v3\n \n      - name: Set up Vercel private registry\n        run: npm config set //vercel-private-registry.vercel.sh/:_authToken $VERCEL_TOKEN\n        env:\n          VERCEL_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}\n \n      - name: Install dependencies\n        run: pnpm install\n \n      - name: Run Conformance\n        run: pnpm conformance\n        env:\n          VERCEL_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}\n```\n\nBy default, GitHub workflows are not required. To require the workflow in your repository, [create a branch protection rule on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/managing-a-branch-protection-rule#creating-a-branch-protection-rule) to Require status checks to pass before merging.",

    "markdown": "# Release Phases for Vercel\n\nThis page outlines the different phases of the Vercel product release cycle. Each phase has a different set of requirements that a product must meet before being assigned to a phase.\n\nAlthough a product doesn't have to pass through each stage in sequential order, there is a default flow to how products are released:\n\n*   Alpha\n*   Beta\n*   General Availability (GA).\n\nThe Alpha phase is the first phase of the release cycle. A product in the Alpha phase lacks the essential features that are required to be ready for GA. The product is considered to still be under development, and is being built to be ready for Beta phase.\n\nThe product is under development.\n\nA Beta state generally means that the feature does not yet meet our quality standards for GA or limited availability. An example of this is when there is a need for more information or feedback from external customers to validate that this feature solves a specific pain point.\n\nReleases in the Beta state have a committed timeline for getting to GA and are actively worked on.\n\nProducts in a Beta state, are **not** covered under the [Service Level Agreement](https://vercel.com/legal/sla) (SLA) for Enterprise plans. Vercel **does not** recommend using Beta products in a full production environment.\n\nWhen a product is in Private Beta, it is still considered to be under development. While some customers may have access, this access sometimes includes a Non-disclosure agreement (NDA)\n\nThe product is under active development with limited customer access - may include an NDA.\n\nA Limited Beta is still under active development, but has been publicly announced, and is potentially available to a limited number of customers.\n\nThis phase is generally used when there is a need to control adoption of a feature. For example, when underlying capacity is limited, if there are known severe caveats then additional guidance may be required.\n\nThe product is under active development, and has been publicly announced. Limited customer access - may include an NDA.\n\nOnce a product has been publicly announced, optionally tested in the field by selected customers, and meets Vercel's quality standards, it is considered to be in the Public Beta phase.\n\nPublic Beta is the final phase of the release cycle before a product goes GA. At this stage the product can be used by a wider audience for load testing, and onboarding.\n\nFor a product to move from Public Beta to GA, the following requirements must be met. Note that these are general requirements, and that each feature may have it's own set of requirements to meet:\n\n*   Fully load tested\n*   All bugs resolved\n*   Security analysis completed\n*   At least 10 customers have been on-boarded\n\nThe product is under active development, and has been publicly announced. Available to the public without special invitation.\n\nWhen the product reaches the General Availability (GA) phase, it is considered to be battle tested, and ready for use by the community.\n\nPublicly available with full support and guaranteed uptime.\n\nA Deprecated state means that the product team is in the process of removing a product or feature. Deprecated states are accompanied by documentation instructing existing users of remediation next steps, and information on when to expect the feature to be in a Sunset state.\n\nThe ultimate state after Deprecation is Sunset. Sunset implies that there should be no customers using the Product and any artifacts within, but not limited to, code, documentation, and marketing have been removed.",

    "markdown": "# Vercel Functions\n\nVercel Functions enable server-side code execution on Vercel's [Managed Infrastructure](https://vercel.com/blog/behind-the-scenes-of-vercels-infrastructure), removing the need for server management or resource provisioning. These functions scale automatically with user demand and can interact with APIs, databases, and other resources as part of your project's deployment.\n\nWhen deployed, Vercel's [Framework defined infrastructure](https://vercel.com/blog/framework-defined-infrastructure), automatically sets up the necessary environment, tools, and patterns as required by your chosen framework. This ensures optimal configuration for your functions, whether they run on the [edge](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/overview) for reduced latency or in a specific [region](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/configuring-functions/region).\n\nVercel Functions can be written with, or without, a [framework](https://vercel.com/docs/frameworks), and handle tasks such as:\n\n*   Streaming data: Process data in real-time, such as chat messages, AI data, or financial transactions\n*   Authentication: Implement authentication and authorization logic\n*   Data Processing: Manage intensive tasks, such as image/video manipulation, without impeding client-side performance\n\n![Functions location within Vercel's managed infrastructure](https://vercel.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.vercel.com%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1706106025%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Fconcepts%2Ffunctions%2Ffunctions-overview-light.png&w=3840&q=75&dpl=dpl_6RGLzPaeBNhuWHRxN1xTYtAhKUa3)![Functions location within Vercel's managed infrastructure](https://vercel.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.vercel.com%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1706106025%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Fconcepts%2Ffunctions%2Ffunctions-overview-dark.png&w=3840&q=75&dpl=dpl_6RGLzPaeBNhuWHRxN1xTYtAhKUa3)\n\nFunctions location within Vercel's managed infrastructure\n\nThe infrastructure and abilities of your Vercel Function is determined by the runtime you choose:\n\n*   [Node.js runtime](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/runtimes#node.js) (Serverless Functions): Gives you access to all the Node.js APIs that you would expect for writing on the web, with the ability to configure machine resources and dependencies\n*   [Edge runtime](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/edge-functions/edge-runtime) (Edge Functions): Opt for this cost-effective choice when you need lightweight JavaScript functions that execute close to the user\n\nTo learn more, see [choosing a runtime](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/runtimes).\n\nTo get started with creating your first function, copy the code below:\n\n```\nexport const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'; // static by default, unless reading the request\n \nexport function GET(request: Request) {\n  return new Response(`Hello from ${process.env.VERCEL_REGION}`);\n}\n```\n\nTo learn more, see the [quickstart](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/quickstart) or deploy a template from the options below:\n\n## Deploy a Vercel Function Template\n\nTo learn more about the limitations for Vercel Functions, see the [Runtimes](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/runtimes) reference. This highlights common limits such as size, memory, [concurrency](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/runtimes#automatic-concurrency-scaling), payload size limit, duration, and pricing.\n\nFunctions have full support for the [`console`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Console) API, including `time`, `debug`, `timeEnd`, etc.\n\n[Runtime logs](https://vercel.com/docs/observability/runtime-logs#what-are-runtime-logs) for all functions can be found in [the Logs tab](https://vercel.com/docs/observability/runtime-logs#view-runtime-logs). You can use the various filters and options to find specific log information. These logs are held for an [amount of time based on your plan](https://vercel.com/docs/observability/runtime-logs#limits).\n\nWhen a Function on a specific path receives a user request, you _may_ see more than one log when the application renders or regenerates the page.\n\nThis can occur in the following situations:\n\n1.  When a new page is rendered\n2.  When you are using [Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)](https://vercel.com/docs/incremental-static-regeneration)\n\nIn the case of ISR, multiple logs are the result of:\n\n*   A [stale](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/caching#cache-invalidation) page having to be regenerated. For stale pages, both HTML (for direct browser navigation) and JSON (for Single Page App (SPA) transitions) are rendered simultaneously to maintain consistency\n*   On-demand ISR happening with `fallback` set as [`blocking`](https://vercel.com/docs/incremental-static-regeneration/quickstart). During on-demand ISR, the page synchronously renders (e.g., HTML) upon request, followed by a background revalidation of both HTML and JSON versions\n\nIn Next.js projects, logged functions include API Routes (those defined in `pages/api/**/*.ts` or `app/**/route.ts`).\n\nPages that use SSR, such as those that call `getServerSideProps` or export [`revalidate`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/revalidating), will also be available both in the filter dropdown and the real time logs.\n\nFor more information on what to do next, we recommend the following articles:",

Based on the request, you can modify the response. Because it runs before the cache, using Middleware is an effective way of [providing personalization](https://vercel.com/resources/edge-middleware-experiments-personalization-performance) to statically generated content. Depending on the incoming request, you can execute custom logic, rewrite, redirect, add headers and more, before returning a response.\n\n![Edge Middleware location within Vercel infrastructure.](https://vercel.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.vercel.com%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1689795055%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Fconcepts%2Ffunctions%2Fedge-middleware-light.png&w=3840&q=75&dpl=dpl_6RGLzPaeBNhuWHRxN1xTYtAhKUa3)![Edge Middleware location within Vercel infrastructure.](https://vercel.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.vercel.com%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1689795055%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Fconcepts%2Ffunctions%2Fedge-middleware-dark.png&w=3840&q=75&dpl=dpl_6RGLzPaeBNhuWHRxN1xTYtAhKUa3)\n\nEdge Middleware location within Vercel infrastructure.\n\nMiddleware uses the [Edge runtime](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/edge-functions/edge-runtime), which exposes and extends a subset of Web Standard APIs such `FetchEvent`, `Response`, and `Request`. To learn more about writing Middleware, see the [Middleware API](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/edge-middleware/middleware-api) docs.\n\nYou can use Edge Middleware with any framework. To add Middleware to your app, you need to create a `middleware.ts` file at your project's root directory.\n\nThe `middleware.ts` file should be at the same level as your `app` or `pages` directory (even if you're using a `src` directory). See the [Quickstart](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/edge-middleware/quickstart) guide for more information.\n\n## Deploy an Edge Middleware Template\n\nEdge Middleware has full support for the [`console`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Console) API, including `time`, `debug`, `timeEnd`, etc. Logs will appear inside your Vercel project by clicking View Functions Logs next to the deployment.\n\nIf your Edge Middleware depends on a database far away from one of [our Edge regions](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/regions), the overall latency of API requests could be slower than expected. To avoid this issue, use a global database. Vercel has multiple global storage products, including [Edge Config](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/edge-config), [Vercel KV](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-kv), and [Vercel Blob](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-blob).

It helps to manage files by grouping them into a hierarchical structure of directories and subdirectories.\n\nIn programming and scripting, \"directory\" is often abbreviated to \"dir\".\n\nIn version control systems like Git, a repository is a location where files, including source code, are stored and managed. It not only houses the current version of every file but also maintains a history of all changes made to these files over time. This history is crucial for tracking modifications, collaborating on code, and reverting to previous versions if necessary.\n\nA monorepo, short for \"monolithic repository\", is a version control strategy in which many packages or modules are stored in a single repository. This approach stands in contrast to a [multi-repo](#multi-repo) approach, where each package or module has its own separate repository.\n\nMonorepos facilitate easier code sharing and collaboration across the different parts of a codebase, and are not limited to a specific package manager or programming language.\n\nA multi-repo, short for \"multi-repository\" and also known as \"polyrepo\", is a version control strategy where each package or module has its own separate repository. This approach stands in contrast to a [monorepo](#monorepo) approach, where multiple packages or modules are stored in a single repository.\n\nIn JavaScript, a workspace refers to a specific entity in a repository that can be either be a [single package](#single-package-workspace) or a [collection of packages](#multi-package-workspace).\n\nThe package manager's root lockfile (i.e. `pnpm-lock.yaml`) is located at the workspace root, along with any additional configuration, such as the paths where packages are located when working in a [multi-package workspace](#multi-package-workspace).\n\nA workspace is often located at the root of a [repository](#repository), but this is not a requirement. For example, some [monorepos](#monorepo) may have multiple workspaces, each located in a subdirectory of the repository.\n\nA workspace that represents a standalone package with a single `package.json` file at the workspace root.\n\nA workspace that contains multiple packages.\n\nA multi-package workspace contains multiple `package.json` files, including one at the workspace root for global configuration, and one in each package directory.\n\nThe configuration for these packages is stored at the root of the workspace. For pnpm, this configuration is in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`. npm and Yarn use the `workspaces` key in `package.json`.\n\nThis type of workspace is often associated with a [monorepo](#monorepo).\n\nA package is a collection of files and directories that are grouped together based on a common purpose. Types of packages include libraries, applications, services, and development tools.\n\nPackages enable complex code bases to be decomposed into smaller, manageable, and independent components. This modular approach is essential to [monorepos](#monorepo), a repository structure that houses multiple interconnected packages, facilitating streamlined management and development of large-scale projects.\n\nIn JavaScript, each package has a `package.json` file at its root, which contains metadata about the package, including its name, version, and any dependencies. Versioning of JavaScript packages generally follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/), and JavaScript packages are often managed and distributed through npm.\n\nSome package managers, including npm, refer to packages as \"workspaces\" in the context of a [multi-package workspace](#multi-package-workspace).",

For security and compliance reasons, you may not be permitted to publicly expose your backend cloud. Even if authentication is required, exposing data sources to the world can be unsafe.\n\nBy enabling Secure Compute on your [Project](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/overview), your deployments and build container will be placed in a private network with dedicated IP addresses in a [region](#specific-region) of your choice and logically separated from other containers.\n\n**Note:** If you would like to use Secure Compute to increase your level of security, compliance, and privacy, contact us to discuss upgrading to Enterprise.\n\n[Contact Sales](https://vercel.com/contact/sales)\n\nWhen you enable Secure Compute on a Project, Vercel places your project's [build container](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/builds#build-process) and subsequent deployment inside a private network with a specific IP address pair (dedicated IP). You can choose to [exclude the build container](#exclude-the-build-container) from the private network.\n\nSecure Compute is managed through the Dashboard as private networks with automatic IP pair assignment. When you [request access](https://vercel.com/contact/sales) to Secure Compute, one private network is created in a [Serverless Function region](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/serverless-functions/regions) of your choice. You can have multiple private networks in the same Team by requesting it from the Dashboard.\n\nTo learn how to attach your Project to your private network, see the [Add a Project to your private network](#add-a-project-to-your-private-network) section.\n\nVercel Secure Compute is applied to [Serverless Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/serverless-functions) only. Edge services like Edge Middleware and Edge Functions will **not** use the provided dedicated IP addresses.\n\nEach private network is deployed in a [Serverless Function region](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/serverless-functions/regions). For the best performance, we recommend that the private network's region is in the same [region](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/serverless-functions/regions) as your backend cloud.\n\nWhen using Secure Compute, you can specify a failover region using the [`functionFailoverRegions`](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/project-configuration#functionfailoverregions) property in your project's `vercel.json`.\n\nFor your failover region to use Secure Compute, you need to [contact sales](https://vercel.com/contact/sales) to create an additional private network in that region. Once created, you can [set that region as your failover region](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/configuring-functions/region#serverless-functions-failover).\n\nOnce the IP pair is ready, you can use it to create an access control list to your backend. In addition to using the IP addresses to authenticate your requests, it is required to use a user/password combination or an authentication key.\n\nUnder a specific Team, you can connect a private network with your Project's [deployment's environment](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/environments), namely [Serverless Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/serverless-functions) and [Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)](https://vercel.com/docs/incremental-static-regeneration).\n\nYou can use one private network with multiple Projects in the same Team. In this case, the same IP pair is shared across multiple Projects.\n\nIf you require additional security or have a large team, you can have one private network for each Project so that each Project will have its own dedicated IP pair.\n\nIf your Serverless Functions are deployed in [multiple regions](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/serverless-functions/regions#set-multiple-serverless-regions), you can use multiple private networks to have different IP pairs in each region.\n\nIn this case, you can allocate different IP addresses to test projects, internal tools and public facing platforms for improved manageability and security.\n\nIf your current security and compliance obligations require more than dedicated IP addresses, contact us for guidance related to your specific needs.\n\n**Note:** If you require support for VPC peering or VPN connections\n\n[Contact Sales](https://vercel.com/contact/sales)\n\nYou can add multiple [Projects](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/overview) to one private network from the Team Settings page of your Vercel Dashboard.

    "markdown": "# Image Optimization with Vercel\n\nVercel streamlines the image optimization process and manages the infrastructure for uploading, optimizing, and delivering images based on factors like pixel density, format, size, and quality. These optimized images are cached on the Vercel Edge Network, ensuring swift delivery to users.\n\nSome popular frameworks, including Next.js, Astro, and Nuxt seamlessly integrate with Vercel's Image Optimization, enabling you to optimize images using built-in components.\n\nFor a live example which demonstrates usage with the [`next/image`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/components/image) component, see the [Image Optimization demo](https://image-component.nextjs.gallery/).\n\nTo start using Image Optimization with Next.js, Astro, or Nuxt, follow the [quickstart](https://vercel.com/docs/image-optimization/quickstart).\n\nIf you are building a custom web framework, you can also use the [Build Output API](https://vercel.com/docs/build-output-api/v3/configuration#images) to implement Image Optimization. To learn how to do this, see the [Build your own web framework](https://vercel.com/blog/build-your-own-web-framework#automatic-image-optimization) blog post.\n\nWhen you use the Images component in common frameworks and deploy your project on Vercel, the Image Optimization feature automatically adjusts your images for different device screen sizes. The `src` prop you provided in your code is dynamically replaced with an optimized image URL. For example:\n\n*   Next.js: `/_next/image?url={link/to/my/image}&w=3840&q=75`\n*   Nuxt.js or Astro: `/_vercel/image?url={link/to/my/image}&w=3840&q=75`\n*   Build Output API: `/_vercel/image?url={link/to/my/image}&w=3840&q=75`\n\nOptimized images are automatically cached on the [Vercel Edge Network](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/overview) and subsequent requests to the same image will be served from the cache. The caching behavior is different for local images compared to remote images:\n\nA local image is imported from your file system and analyzed at build time. The import is added to the `src` prop: `src={myImage}`\n\n*   Cache Key:\n    *   Query string parameters:\n        *   `q`: The quality of the optimized image, between 1 (lowest quality) and 100 (highest quality).\n        *   `w`: The width (in pixels) of the optimized image\n        *   `url`: The URL of the optimized image is keyed by content hash e.g. `/assets/me.png` is converted to `3399d02f49253deb9f5b5d1159292099`\n    *   `Accept` HTTP header (normalized)\n*   Local image cache invalidation:\n    *   Redeploying your app doesn't invalidate the image cache\n    *   To invalidate, replace the image of the same name with different content, then redeploy\n*   Local image cache expiration:\n    *   [Cached](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/caching#static-files-caching) for up to 31 days on the Edge Network\n\nA remote image requires the `src` property to be a URL string, which can be relative or absolute. As Next.js doesn't have access to remote files during the build process, the `width` and `height` props are needed.\n\n*   Cache key:\n    *   Query string parameters:\n        *   `q`: The quality of the optimized image, between 1 (lowest quality) and 100 (highest quality).\n        *   `w`: The width (in pixels) of the optimized image\n        *   `url`: The URL of the optimized image e.g. `https://example.com/assets/me.png`\n    *   `Accept` HTTP header (normalized)\n*   Remote image cache invalidation:\n    *   Redeploying your app doesn't invalidate the image cache\n    *   To invalidate, add a query string to the `src` property (e.g., `?v=2`), then redeploy\n    *   Alternatively, you can configure the cache to expire more frequently\n*   Remote image cache expiration:\n    *   TTL is determined by the [`Cache-Control`](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/headers#cache-control-header) `max-age` header from the upstream image or [`minimumCacheTTL`](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/image#minimum-cache-ttl) config (default: `60` seconds), whichever is larger\n    *   If your image content changes frequently, it's best to keep this TTL short\n\nRefer to the [Limits and Pricing](https://vercel.com/docs/image-optimization/limits-and-pricing) page for more information. Measure real-world performance using [Speed Insights](https://vercel.com/docs/speed-insights) before and after adopting Image Optimization.\n\nOptimizing images on Vercel provides several advantages for your application:\n\n*   Enhanced website performance, user experience, and [Fast Data Transfer](https://vercel.com/docs/pricing/networking#fast-data-transfer) savings\n*   Improved [Core Web Vitals](https://web.dev/vitals/), reduced bounce rates, and faster page loads\n*   Properly sized images for different devices and support for modern formats like [WebP](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Image_types#webp_image) and [AVIF](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Image_types#avif_image)\n*   When [source images](https://vercel.com/docs/image-optimization/limits-and-pricing#source-images) cannot be optimized, Vercel will fall back to serving the original image\n*   Vercel manages the infrastructure for generating and caching optimized images at the Edge for quick responses\n\nFor more information on what to do next, we recommend the following articles:",

Postgres ensures high consistency and concurrency, making it well-suited for applications that require reliable, real-time data management\n\nRich data types and extensibility – Choose Postgres for handling diverse data formats or custom data types, such as JSON, arrays, or user-generated content\n\nVercel Blob offers optimized storage for images, videos, and other files.\n\nYou should use Vercel Blob if you need to:\n\nStore images – For example, storing user avatars or product images\n\nStore videos – For example, storing user-generated video content\n\nAn Edge Config is a global data store that enables you to read data at the edge without querying an external database or hitting upstream servers. Most lookups return in less than 1ms, and 99% of reads will return under 10ms.\n\nYou should use Edge Config if you need to:\n\nFetch data at ultra-low latency – For example, you should store feature flags in an Edge Config store\n\nStore data that is read often but changes rarely – For example, you should store critical redirect URLs in an Edge Config store\n\nRead data in every region – Edge Config data is actively replicated to all regions in the Vercel Edge Network\n\nWhen choosing a storage option, we recommend considering these best practices:\n\nTo ensure low-latency responses, it's crucial to have compute close to your databases. Always deploy your databases in [regions](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/regions) closest to your Functions to avoid long network roundtrips.\n\n*   [Serverless Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/serverless-functions): Defaults to `iad1`, but can be deployed to any region\n    *   If using Vercel Postgres, ensure your database is in the same region as your Function\n    *   If using Vercel KV and replicated regions, place your stores in the same regions as your Functions\n*   [Edge Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/edge-functions): Global by default, opt-into single-region\n    *   If using Vercel Postgres, ensure your database is in the same region as your Function\n    *   If using Vercel KV and replicated regions, place your stores in the same regions as your Functions\n*   [Edge Middleware](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/edge-middleware): Global only; always executed in the region nearest the user\n    *   Since Edge Middleware as part of request processing, it is best suited for extremely fast and globally replicated data like [Edge Config](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/edge-config)\n\nVercel's Edge Network provides caching in every region globally. To ensure the fastest response times, ensure data fetched from your data store is properly [cached](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/edge-network/caching) at the Edge.\n\n[Incremental Static Regeneration](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/incremental-static-regeneration/overview) automates properly setting up caching headers and globally storing generated assets for you. This ensures the highest availability for your traffic and prevents accidental misconfiguration of cache-control headers.\n\nYou can manually configure cache-control headers when using [Vercel Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/caching#using-vercel-functions) to cache the response data in every Edge region. Edge Middleware runs before the Edge Network cache layer and cannot use cache-control headers.\n\nYou can bring your KV or Postgres Database along with your account as you upgrade from Hobby to Pro, or downgrade from Pro to Hobby. To do so:\n\n1.  Navigate to the [dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard) and select the Storage tab\n2.  Select Settings, then select Transfer Database or Transfer Store\n3.  Select a destination account or team. If you're upgrading to Pro, select your new Pro team. If downgrading, select your Hobby account\n\nWhen successful, you'll be taken to the Storage tab of the account or team you transferred the database or store to.\n\nYour pricing and available features will change based on the plan your database is under.

    "markdown": "# Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)\n\nIncremental Static Regeneration (ISR) allows you to create or update content on your site without redeploying. ISR's main benefits for developers include:\n\n1.  Better Performance: Static pages can be consistently fast because ISR allows Vercel to cache generated pages in every region on [our global Edge Network](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/overview) and persist files into durable storage\n2.  Reduced Backend Load: ISR helps reduce backend load by using cached content to make fewer requests to your data sources\n3.  Faster Builds: Pages can be generated when requested by a visitor or through an API instead of during the build, speeding up build times as your application grows\n\nISR is available to applications built with:\n\n*   [Next.js](#using-isr-with-next.js)\n*   [SvelteKit](https://vercel.com/docs/frameworks/sveltekit#incremental-static-regeneration-isr)\n*   [Nuxt](https://vercel.com/docs/frameworks/nuxt#incremental-static-regeneration-isr)\n*   [Astro](https://vercel.com/docs/frameworks/astro#incremental-static-regeneration-isr)\n*   [Gatsby](https://vercel.com/docs/frameworks/gatsby#incremental-static-regeneration-isr)\n*   Or any custom framework solution that implements the [Build Output API](https://vercel.com/docs/build-output-api/v3)\n\n## Explore ISR with a project template\n\n### Interested in the Enterprise plan?\n\nContact our sales team to learn more about the Enterprise plan and how it can benefit your team.\n\nNext.js will automatically create a Serverless Vercel Function that can revalidate when you add `next: { revalidate: 10 }` to the options object passed to a `fetch` request.\n\nThe following example demonstrates a Next.js page that uses ISR to render a list of blog posts:\n\n```\ninterface Post {\n  title: string;\n  id: number;\n}\n \nexport default async function Page() {\n  const res = await fetch('https://api.vercel.app/blog', {\n    next: { revalidate: 10 },\n  });\n  const posts = (await res.json()) as Post[];\n  return (\n    <ul>\n      {posts.map((post: Post) => {\n        return <li key={post.id}>{post.title}</li>;\n      })}\n    </ul>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nTo learn more about using ISR with Next.js in the App router, such as enabling on-demand revalidation, see [the official Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/revalidating).\n\n*   See [our dedicated SvelteKit docs](https://vercel.com/docs/frameworks/sveltekit#incremental-static-regeneration-isr) to learn how to use ISR with your SvelteKit projects on Vercel\n*   See [our dedicated Nuxt docs](https://vercel.com/docs/frameworks/nuxt#incremental-static-regeneration-isr) to use ISR with Nuxt\n\nWhen using the Build Output API, the Serverless Vercel Functions generated for your ISR routes are called [Prerender Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/build-output-api/v3#vercel-primitives/prerender-functions).\n\nBuild Output API Prerender Functions are [Serverless Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/serverless-functions) with accompanying JSON files that describe the Function's cache invalidation rules. See [our Prerender configuration file docs](https://vercel.com/docs/build-output-api/v3/primitives#prerender-configuration-file) to learn more.\n\nBoth ISR and `Cache-Control` headers help reduce backend load by using cached content to make fewer requests to your data source. However, there are key architectural differences between the two.\n\n*   Shared Global Cache: ISR has cache shielding built-in automatically, which helps improve the cache `HIT` ratio. The cache for your ISR route's Vercel Function output is distributed globally. In the case of a cache `MISS`, it looks up the value in a single, global bucket. With only [`cache-control` headers](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/caching), caches expire (by design) and are not shared across [regions](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/regions)\n*   300ms Global Purges: When revalidating (either on-demand or in the background), your ISR route's Vercel Function is re-run, and the cache is brought up to date with the newest content within 300ms in all regions globally\n*   Instant Rollbacks: ISR allows you to roll back instantly and not lose your previously generated pages by persisting them between deployments\n*   Simplified Caching Experience: ISR abstracts common issues with HTTP-based caching implementations, adds additional features for availability and global performance, and provides a better developer experience for implementation\n\nSee [our Cache control options docs](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/caching#cache-control-options) to learn more about `Cache-Control` headers.\n\nOn-demand revalidation is scoped to the domain and deployment where it occurs, and doesn't affect sub domains or other deployments.\n\nFor example, if you trigger on-demand revalidation for `example-domain.com/example-page`, it won't revalidate the same page served by sub domains on the same deployment, such as `sub.example-domain.com/example-page`.\n\nSee [Revalidating across domains](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/caching#revalidating-across-domains) to learn how to get around this limitation.\n\nWhen using ISR with a framework on Vercel, a Function is created based on your framework code. This means that using ISR incurs both Function usage as well as [Fast Origin Transfer](https://vercel.com/docs/pricing/networking#fast-origin-transfer):\n\n*   Incur usage when invoked – ISR functions are invoked whenever they revalidate in the background or through [on-demand revalidation](https://vercel.com/docs/incremental-static-regeneration/quickstart#on-demand-revalidation)\n*   Add to your [Fast Origin Transfer](https://vercel.com/docs/pricing/networking#fast-origin-transfer) usage\n\nExplore your [usage top paths](https://vercel.com/docs/limits/usage#top-paths) to better understand ISR usage and pricing.",

    "markdown": "# Vercel Blob\n\n[Vercel Blob](https://vercel.com/storage/blob) is a great solution for storing [blobs](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Blob) that need to be frequently read. Here are some examples suitable for Vercel Blob:\n\n*   Files that are programmatically uploaded or generated at build time, for display and download such as avatars, screenshots, cover images and videos\n*   Large files such as videos and audios to take advantage of the global network\n*   Files that you would normally store in an external file storage solution like Amazon S3. With your project hosted on Vercel, you can readily access and manage these files with Vercel Blob\n\nYou can create and manage your Vercel Blob stores from your [account dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard). You can scope your Vercel Blob stores to your Hobby account or [team](https://vercel.com/docs/accounts/create-a-team), and connect them to as many projects as you want.\n\nTo get started, see the [server-side](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-blob/server-upload), or [client-side](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-blob/client-upload) quickstart guides.\n\nIf you'd like to know whether or not Vercel Blob can be integrated into your workflow, it's worth knowing the following:\n\n*   You can have one or more Vercel Blob stores per Vercel account\n*   You can use multiple Vercel Blob stores in one Vercel project\n*   Each Vercel Blob store can be accessed by multiple Vercel projects\n*   Vercel Blob URLs are publicly accessible, created with an unguessable random id, and immutable\n*   To add to or remove from the content of a Blob store, a valid [token](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-blob/using-blob-sdk#read-write-token) is required\n*   Making a blob private is planned in an upcoming release\n\nThere are two ways to upload files to Vercel Blob:\n\n1.  [Server uploads](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-blob/server-upload): This is the most common way to upload files. The file is first sent to your server and then to Vercel Blob. It's straightforward to implement, but you are limited to the request body your server can handle. Which in case of a Vercel-hosted website is 4.5 MB. This means you can't upload files larger than 4.5 MB on Vercel when using this method.\n2.  [Client uploads](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-blob/client-upload): This is a more advanced solution for when you need to upload larger files. The file is securely sent directly from the client (a browser for example) to Vercel Blob. This requires a bit more work to implement, but it allows you to upload files up to 5 TB (5,000 GB).\n\nYou can also upload files larger than 4.5 MB directly from a script or server code, as long as the file isn't received from a Vercel-hosted website. An example of that would be a server-side `fetch()` request streaming the response to Vercel Blob.\n\nVercel Blob URLs, although publicly accessible, are unique and hard to guess. They are composed of a unique store id, a pathname and a unique random blob id generated when the blob is created.\n\nThis is similar to [Share a file publicly](https://support.google.com/drive/answer/2494822?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop#zippy=%2Cshare-a-file-publicly) in Google Docs. You should ensure that the URLs are only shared to authorized users\n\nHeaders that enhance security by preventing unauthorized downloads, blocking external content from being embedded, and protecting against malicious file type manipulation, are enforced on each blob. They are:\n\n*   `content-security-policy`: `default-src \"none\"`\n*   `x-frame-options`: `DENY`\n*   `x-content-type-options`: `nosniff`\n*   `content-disposition`: `attachment/inline; filename=\"filename.extension\"`\n\nAll files stored on Vercel Blob are secured using AES-256 encryption. This encryption process is applied at rest and is transparent, ensuring that files are encrypted before being saved to the disk and decrypted upon retrieval.\n\nEach Blob is served with a `content-disposition` header. Based on the MIME type of the uploaded file, it is either set to `attachment` (force file download) or `inline` (can render in a browser tab). This is done to prevent hosting specific files on `@vercel/blob` like HTML web pages. Your browser will automatically download the file instead of displaying it for these cases.\n\nCurrently `text/plain`, `text/xml`, `application/json`, `application/pdf`, `image/*`, `audio/*` and `video/*` resolve to a `content-disposition: inline` header.\n\nAll other MIME types default to `content-disposition: attachment`.\n\nIf you need a blob URL that always forces a download you can use the `downloadUrl` property on the blob object. This URL always has the `content-disposition: attachment` header no matter its MIME type.\n\n```\nimport { list } from '@vercel/blob';\n \nexport default async function Page() {\n  const response = await list();\n \n  return (\n    <>\n      {response.blobs.map((blob) => (\n        <a key={blob.pathname} href={blob.downloadUrl}>\n          {blob.pathname}\n        </a>\n      ))}\n    </>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nAlternatively the SDK exposes a helper function called `getDownloadUrl` that returns the same URL.\n\nVercel Blobs have two levels of caching:\n\n1.  In browsers: Blobs are cached for one year.\n2.  In Vercel's [edge network](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/caching): Blobs are cached for 5 minutes.\n\nThe 5-minute \\[edge cache\\[(/docs/edge-network/caching) is important when you're updating or deleting blobs:\n\n*   If you override (update) a blob, it may take up to 5 minutes for the changes to be visible.\n*   If you delete a blob, it may still be accessible for up to 5 minutes.\n\nHowever, when you create a new blob, it's available immediately without any caching delay, as it doesn't exist in the cache yet.\n\nYou can configure this caching behavior by using the `cacheControlMaxAge` option on the [`put()`](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-blob/using-blob-sdk#put) method.\n\nThe minimum value is 0 second for browser and edge cache. The maximum value is 5 minutes (300 seconds) for edge cache and unlimited for browser cache.\n\nThe query string on the blob URL is not part of the cache key, meaning you cannot bypass the cache by adding a unique query string to the URL. To bypass the cache, upload a new version of your file with a different pathname.\n\nNote: when serving blobs from the edge cache, we do no not increment the number of basic operations, we only bill for the used bandwidth.\n\nVercel Blob has folders support to organize your files:\n\n```\nconst blob = await put('folder/file.txt', 'Hello World!', { access: 'public' });\n```\n\nThe path `folder/file.txt` creates a folder named `folder` and a blob file named `file.txt`. To list all blobs within a folder, use the [`list`](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-blob/using-blob-sdk#list-blobs) function:\n\n```\nconst listOfBlobs = await list({\n  cursor,\n  limit: 1000,\n  prefix: 'folder/',\n});\n```\n\nYou don't need to create folders. Upload a file with a path containing a slash `/`, and Vercel Blob will interpret the slashes as folder delimiters.\n\nIn the Vercel Blob file browser on the Vercel dashboard, any pathname with a slash `/` is treated as a folder. However, these are not actual folders like in a traditional file system; they are used for organizing blobs in listings and the file browser.\n\nVercel Blob supports [range requests](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Range_requests) for partial downloads. This means you can download only a portion of a blob, here are examples:\n\n```\ncurl https://1sxstfwepd7zn41q.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/range-requests.txt\n# 0123456789\n \n# First 5 bytes\ncurl -r 0-4 https://1sxstfwepd7zn41q.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/range-requests.txt\n# 01234\n \n# Last 5 bytes\ncurl -r -5 https://1sxstfwepd7zn41q.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/range-requests.txt\n# 56789\n \n# Bytes 3-6\ncurl -r 3-6 https://1sxstfwepd7zn41q.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/range-requests.txt\n# 3456\n```\n\nEvery Vercel Blob operation can be canceled, just like a fetch call. This is useful when you want to abort an ongoing operation, for example, when a user navigates away from a page or when the request takes too long.\n\n```\nconst abortController = new AbortController();\n \ntry {\n  const blobPromise = vercelBlob.put('hello.txt', 'Hello World!', {\n    access: 'public',\n    abortSignal: abortController.signal,\n  });\n \n  const timeout = setTimeout(() => {\n    // Abort the request after 1 second\n    abortController.abort();\n  }, 1000);\n \n  const blob = await blobPromise;\n \n  console.info('blob put request completed', blob);\n \n  clearTimeout(timeout);\n \n  return blob.url;\n} catch (error) {\n  if (error instanceof vercelBlob.BlobRequestAbortedError) {\n    // Handle the abort\n    console.info('canceled put request');\n  }\n \n  // Handle other errors\n}\n```\n\nIf, for some reason, you want to delete all the blobs in your store, do this:\n\n```\nimport { list, del } from '@vercel/blob';\n \nasync function deleteAllBlobs() {\n  let cursor;\n \n  do {\n    const listResult = await list({\n      cursor,\n      limit: 1000,\n    });\n \n    if (listResult.blobs.length > 0) {\n      await del(listResult.blobs.map((blob) => blob.url));\n    }\n \n    cursor = listResult.cursor;\n  } while (cursor);\n \n  console.log('All blobs were deleted');\n}\n \ndeleteAllBlobs().catch((error) => {\n  console.error('An error occurred:', error);\n});\n```",

    "markdown": "# Caching on Vercel's Edge Network\n\nVercel's [Edge Network](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/overview) caches your content at the edge in order to serve data to your users as fast as possible. Vercel's caching is available for all deployments and domains on your account, regardless of the [pricing plan](https://vercel.com/pricing).\n\nVercel uses the Edge Network to cache your content globally and serve data to your users as quickly as possible. There are two ways to cache content:\n\n*   [Static file caching](#static-files-caching) is automatic for all deployments, requiring no manual configuration\n*   To cache dynamic content, including SSR content, you can use `Cache-Control` [headers](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/headers#cache-control-header)\n\nYou can cache responses on Vercel with `Cache-Control` headers defined in:\n\n1.  Responses from [Vercel Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/serverless-functions)\n2.  Route definitions in `vercel.json` or `next.config.js`\n\nYou can use any combination of the above options, but if you return `Cache-Control` headers in a Vercel Function, it will override the headers defined for the same route in `vercel.json` or `next.config.js`.\n\nTo cache the response of Serverless and Edge Functions on Vercel's Edge Network, you must include [`Cache-Control`](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/headers#cache-control-header) headers with any of the following directives:\n\n*   `s-maxage=N`\n*   `s-maxage=N, stale-while-revalidate=Z`\n\n`proxy-revalidate` and `stale-if-error` are not currently supported.\n\nThe following example demonstrates a [function](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/edge-functions) that caches its response and revalidates it every 1 second:\n\n```\nexport async function GET() {\n  return new Response('Cache Control example', {\n    status: 200,\n    headers: {\n      'Cache-Control': 'public, s-maxage=1',\n      'CDN-Cache-Control': 'public, s-maxage=60',\n      'Vercel-CDN-Cache-Control': 'public, s-maxage=3600',\n    },\n  });\n}\n```\n\nTo deploy the above route as a Serverless Function, change the exported `runtime` property to `nodejs`\n\nFor direct control over caching on Vercel and downstream CDNs, you can use [CDN-Cache-Control](#cdn-cache-control) headers.\n\nYou can define route headers in `vercel.json` or `next.config.js` files. These headers will be overridden by [headers defined in Function responses](#using-vercel-functions).\n\nThe following example demonstrates a `vercel.json` file that adds `Cache-Control` headers to a route:\n\n```\n{\n  \"headers\": [\n    {\n      \"source\": \"/about.js\",\n      \"headers\": [\n        {\n          \"key\": \"Cache-Control\",\n          \"value\": \"s-maxage=1, stale-while-revalidate=59\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nIf you're building your app with Next.js, you should use `next.config.js` rather than `vercel.json`. The following example demonstrates a `next.config.js` file that adds `Cache-Control` headers to a route:\n\n```\n/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */\nconst nextConfig = {\n  reactStrictMode: true,\n  async headers() {\n    return [\n      {\n        source: '/about',\n        headers: [\n          {\n            key: 'Cache-Control',\n            value: 's-maxage=1, stale-while-revalidate=59',\n          },\n        ],\n      },\n    ];\n  },\n};\n \nmodule.exports = nextConfig;\n```\n\nSee [the Next docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js) to learn more about `next.config.js`.\n\nStatic files are automatically cached at the edge after the first request and are cached for up to 31 days on Vercel's Edge Network.\n\n*   If a static file is unchanged, the cached value can persist across deployments due to the hash used in the filename\n*   Optimized images cached will [persist between deployments](https://vercel.com/docs/image-optimization#caching)\n*   The default `Cache-Control` header contains `public`, `max-age=0`, `must-revalidate` to prevent clients (e.g. browsers) from caching the file locally\n\n*   `max-age=N, public`\n*   `max-age=N, immutable`\n\nWhere `N` is the number of seconds the response should be cached. The response must also meet the [caching criteria](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/caching#how-to-cache-responses).\n\nYou can cache dynamic content through [Edge Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/edge-functions) and [Serverless Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/serverless-functions), including SSR, by adding `Cache-Control` [headers](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/headers#cache-control-header) to your response. When you specify `Cache-Control` headers in a function, responses will be cached in the region the function was requested from.\n\nSee [our docs on Cache-Control headers](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/headers#cache-control-header) to learn how to best use `Cache-Control` directives on Vercel's Edge Network.\n\nVercel supports two [targeted headers for controlling the cache](https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc9213.html):\n\n*   `CDN-Cache-Control`, which allows you to control the Vercel Edge Cache or other CDN cache _separately_ from the browser's cache. The browser will not be affected by this header\n*   `Vercel-CDN-Cache-Control`, which allows you to specifically control Vercel's Edge Cache. Neither other CDNs nor the browser will be affected by this header\n\nBy default, the headers returned to the browser are as follows:\n\n*   `Cache-Control`\n*   `CDN-Cache-Control`\n\n`Vercel-CDN-Cache-Control` headers are not returned to the browser or forwarded to other CDNs.\n\nTo learn how these headers work in detail, see [our dedicated headers docs](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/headers#cdn-cache-control-header).\n\nThe following example demonstrates `Cache-Control` headers that instruct:\n\n*   Vercel's Edge Cache to have a [TTL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_to_live) of `3600` seconds\n*   Downstream CDNs to have a TTL of `60` seconds\n*   Clients to have a TTL of `10` seconds\n\n```\nexport async function GET() {\n  return new Response('Cache Control example', {\n    status: 200,\n    headers: {\n      'Cache-Control': 'max-age=10',\n      'CDN-Cache-Control': 'max-age=60',\n      'Vercel-CDN-Cache-Control': 'max-age=3600',\n    },\n  });\n}\n```\n\nIf you set `Cache-Control` without a `CDN-Cache-Control`, the Vercel Edge Network strips `s-maxage` and `stale-while-revalidate` from the response before sending it to the browser. To determine if the response was served from the cache, check the [`x-vercel-cache`](#x-vercel-cache) header in the response.\n\nThe `Cache-Control` field is an HTTP header specifying caching rules for client (browser) requests and server responses. A cache must obey the requirements defined in the `Cache-Control` header.\n\nFor server responses to be successfully cached with Vercel's Edge Network, the following criteria must be met:\n\n*   Request uses `GET` or `HEAD` method.\n*   Request does not contain `Range` header.\n*   Request does not contain `Authorization` header.\n*   Response uses `200`, `404`, `301`, `302`, `307` or `308` status code.\n*   Response does not exceed `10MB` in content length.\n*   Response does not contain the `set-cookie` header.\n*   Response does not contain the `private`, `no-cache` or `no-store` directives in the `Cache-Control` header.\n\nVercel does not allow bypassing the cache for static files by design.\n\nEvery deployment has a unique key used for caching based on the deployment URL created at build time. This key ensures that users never see content from a previous deployment. It contains the following information:\n\n*   The request method (such as `GET`, `POST`, etc)\n*   The request URL (query strings are ignored for static files)\n*   The host domain\n*   The unique [deployment URL](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/generated-urls)\n*   The scheme (whether it's `https` or `http`)\n*   The `accept` header (Image Optimization requests only)\n\nThe cache is automatically purged upon a new deployment being created. If you ever need to invalidate Vercel's Edge Network cache, you can always re-deploy.\n\nIf your project is in Next.js using the app router, you can use [`revalidateTag`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/revalidateTag) to trigger revalidation on a different domain within the same project. To do so, you must:\n\n1.  Use the `tag` option with your `fetch` request to tag the cached data:\n\n```\ninterface Post {\n  title: string;\n  id: number;\n}\n \nexport default async function Page() {\n  const res = await fetch('https://api.vercel.app/blog', {\n    next: {\n      tags: ['blog-posts'],\n      revalidate: 10,\n    },\n  });\n  const posts = (await res.json()) as Post[];\n  return (\n    <ul>\n      {posts.map((post: Post) => {\n        return <li key={post.id}>{post.title}</li>;\n      })}\n    </ul>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n2.  Call `revalidateTag` from your revalidate route with the tag you applied to the cache:\n\n```\nimport { NextRequest } from 'next/server';\nimport { revalidateTag } from 'next/cache';\n \nexport async function GET(request: NextRequest) {\n  revalidateTag('blog-posts');\n  return Response.json({ revalidated: true, now: Date.now() });\n}\n```\n\nThe `x-vercel-cache` header is included in HTTP responses to the client, and describes the state of the cache.\n\nSee [our headers docs](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/headers#x-vercel-cache) to learn more.\n\nVercel's Edge Network cache is segmented [by region](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/regions). The following caching limits apply to Vercel Function responses:\n\n*   Max Cacheable Response Size = 10MB\n*   Max Cache Time = 31 days\n    *   `s-maxage`\n    *   `max-age`\n    *   `stale-while-revalidate`\n\nWhile you can put the maximum time for server-side caching, cache times are best-effort and not guaranteed. If an asset is requested often, it is more likely to live the entire duration. If your asset is rarely requested (e.g. once a day), it may be evicted from the regional cache.\n\nVercel does not currently support using `proxy-revalidate` and `stale-if-error` for server-side caching.",

    "markdown": "# Vercel Data Cache\n\nThe Vercel Data Cache is a specialized, granular cache for storing responses from fetches while using frontend frameworks like [Next.js](https://vercel.com/docs/frameworks/nextjs).\n\nFrameworks that integrate with the Data Cache (currently Next.js) are able to cache data per fetch instead of per route. This means you can have static, dynamic, and revalidated data together in the same route.\n\nWith Vercel, you write application code, like component-level data fetching with `fetch`, and we scaffold globally distributed infrastructure for you with no additional effort. See [our examples](#examples) to learn how to implement this.\n\n*   Ephemeral, globally available, regional cache: Every region in which your serverless or edge function runs has an independent cache, so any data used in server side rendering or Next.js route handlers is cached close to where the function executes.\n*   Time-based revalidation: All cached data can define a revalidation interval, after which the data will be marked as stale, triggering a re-fetch from origin.\n*   On-demand revalidation: Any data can be triggered for revalidation on-demand, regardless of the revalidation interval. The revalidation propagates to all regions within 300ms.\n*   Tag based revalidation: Next.js allows associating tags with data, which can be used to revalidate all data with the same tag at once with `revalidateTag`. For example, you could use this to revalidate all responses from a CMS with the same author ID tag.\n\nNext.js combines Vercel Data Cache with [Incremental Static Regeneration](https://vercel.com/docs/incremental-static-regeneration) (ISR) to provide optimized caching infrastructure for your pages.\n\nWhen a page contains _entirely static data_, Vercel will use ISR to generate the whole page. However, when a page contains a _mix of static and dynamic data_, the dynamic data needs to be re-fetched when rendering the page. In this scenario, Vercel Data Cache is used to cache the static data to avoid slow origin fetches.\n\nBoth ISR and Vercel Data Cache support time-based revalidation, on-demand revalidation, and tag based revalidation.\n\n[Vercel's Edge Cache](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/caching) is used for caching entire static assets at the edge, such as images, fonts, and JavaScript bundles. The Vercel Data Cache is used for caching data fetched during a function's execution, such as API responses.\n\nWhen you deploy a Next.js project that uses [App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app) to Vercel, the Vercel Data Cache is automatically enabled to cache [segment-level data](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/fetching-caching-and-revalidating) alongside ISR in the app router.\n\nTo learn more about managing your Data Cache, including disabling it, and purging the cache, see [Managing Data Cache](https://vercel.com/docs/infrastructure/data-cache/manage-data-cache).\n\nThese examples use the [Next.js App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/fetching-caching-and-revalidating):\n\n```\nexport default async function Page() {\n  const res = await fetch('https://api.vercel.app/blog', {\n    next: {\n      revalidate: 3600, // 1 hour\n    },\n  });\n  const data = await res.json();\n \n  return '...';\n}\n```\n\n```\nexport default async function Page() {\n  const res = await fetch('https://api.vercel.app/blog', {\n    next: {\n      tags: ['blog'], // Invalidate with revalidateTag('blog') on-demand\n    },\n  });\n  const data = await res.json();\n \n  return '...';\n}\n```\n\n```\n'use server';\n \nimport { revalidateTag } from 'next/cache';\n \nexport default async function action() {\n  revalidateTag('blog');\n}\n```\n\nThe Vercel Data Cache is unique per Vercel project, isolated per deployment environment (`production` or `preview`).\n\nCached data is persisted across deployments, unless invalidated through `revalidate` or programmatically calling `revalidateTag` or `revalidatePath`. It is not updated at build time. When invalidated, it will be updated at run time with the next new request to the path that was invalidated.\n\nWhen a revalidation is triggered, the path or cache tag is marked stale globally in every Vercel Edge Network region. The next request to that path or tag, in any region, will trigger a revalidation and update the cache globally. The regional cache in all regions is purged and updated within 300ms.\n\nFor information, see the [usage and pricing](https://vercel.com/docs/infrastructure/data-cache/limits-and-pricing) page for the Data Cache.",

It enables you to read data at the edge without querying an external database or hitting upstream servers.\n\nWith Vercel's optimizations, you can read Edge Config data at negligible latency. The vast majority of your reads will complete within 15ms [at P99](https://vercel.com/docs/speed-insights#how-the-percentages-are-calculated), or as low as 0ms in some scenarios.\n\nYou can use an Edge Config in [Edge Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/edge-functions), [Edge Middleware](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/edge-middleware), and [Serverless Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/serverless-functions).\n\nEdge Configs are great for data that is accessed frequently and updated infrequently. Here are some examples of storage data suitable for Edge Config:\n\n**Feature flags and A/B testing**: Experiment with A/B testing by storing feature flags in your Edge Config. Fetching such data from Edge Config rather than a database can cut page loads by hundreds of milliseconds. [Deploy the template](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/feature-flag-apple-store)\n\n**Critical redirects**: When you need to redirect a URL urgently, Edge Configs offer a fast solution that doesn't require you to redeploy your website. Using Edge Middleware, you can read from your Edge Config to redirect users when they visit bad URLs. [Deploy the template](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/maintenance-page)\n\n**Malicious IP and User Agent blocking**: Store a set of malicious IPs in your Edge Config, then block them upon detection without invoking upstream servers\n\nYou can create and manage your Edge Config from either [Vercel REST API](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/edge-config/vercel-api) or [Dashboard](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/edge-config/edge-config-dashboard). You can scope your Edge Configs to your Hobby account or [team](https://vercel.com/docs/accounts/create-a-team), and connect them to as many projects as you want.\n\nTo get started, see [our quickstart](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/edge-config/get-started).\n\n## Deploy an Edge Config Template\n\nIf you'd like to know whether or not Edge Config can be integrated into your workflow, it's worth knowing the following:\n\n*   You can have one or more Edge Configs per Vercel account, depending on your plan as explained in [Limits](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/edge-config/edge-config-limits)\n*   You can use multiple Edge Configs in one Vercel project\n*   Each Edge Config can be accessed by multiple Vercel projects\n*   Edge Configs can be scoped to different environments within projects using environment variables\n*   Edge Config access is secure by default. A [read access token](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/edge-config/using-edge-config#creating-a-read-access-token) is required to read from them, and an [API token](https://vercel.com/docs/rest-api#creating-an-access-token) is required to write to them\n\nSee [our Edge Config limits docs to learn more](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/edge-config/edge-config-limits)\n\nThere are alternative solutions to Edge Config for handling A/B testing, feature flags, and IP blocking. The following table lays out how those solutions compare to Edge Config:\n\n| Edge Config vs alternatives | Read latency | Write latency | Redeployment required | Added risk of downtime |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Edge Config | Ultra-low | Varies | No  | No  |\n| Remote JSON files | Varies | Varies | No  | Yes |\n| Embedded JSON files | Lowest | Highest | Yes | No  |\n| Environment Variables | Lowest | Highest | Yes | No  |\n\nTo learn about Edge Config limits and pricing, see [our Edge Config limits docs](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/edge-config/edge-config-limits).",

    "markdown": "# Cron Jobs\n\nCron jobs are time-based scheduling tools used to automate repetitive tasks. By using a specific syntax called a [cron expression](#cron-expressions), you can define the frequency and timing of each task. This helps improve efficiency and ensures that important processes are performed consistently.\n\nSome common use cases of cron jobs are:\n\n*   Automating backups and archiving them\n*   Sending email and Slack notifications\n*   Updating Stripe subscription quantities\n\nVercel supports cron jobs for [Serverless](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/serverless-functions) and [Edge](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/edge-functions) Functions. Cron jobs can be added through [vercel.json](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/project-configuration) or the [Build Output API](https://vercel.com/docs/build-output-api/v3/configuration#crons).\n\nSee [Managing Cron Jobs](https://vercel.com/docs/cron-jobs/manage-cron-jobs) for information on duration, error handling, deployments, concurrency control, and local execution. To learn about usage limits and pricing information, see the [Usage and Pricing](https://vercel.com/docs/cron-jobs/usage-and-pricing) page.\n\n## Deploy a Cron Job Template\n\nLearn how to set up and configure cron jobs for your project using our [Quickstart](https://vercel.com/docs/cron-jobs/quickstart) guide.\n\nTo trigger a cron job, Vercel makes an HTTP GET request to your project's production deployment URL, using the `path` provided in your project's `vercel.json` file. An example endpoint Vercel would make a request to in order to trigger a cron job might be: `https://*.vercel.app/api/cron`.\n\nVercel supports the following cron expressions format:\n\n| Field | Value Range | Example Expression | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Minute | 0 - 59 | `5 * * * *` | Triggers at 5 minutes past the hour |\n| Hour | 0 - 23 | `* 5 * * *` | Triggers every minute, between 05:00 AM and 05:59 AM |\n| Day of Month | 1 - 31 | `* * 5 * *` | Triggers every minute, on day 5 of the month |\n| Month | 1 - 12 | `* * * 5 *` | Triggers every minute, only in May |\n| Day of Week | 0 - 6 (Sun-Sat) | `* * * * 5` | Triggers every minute, only on Friday |\n\nTo validate your cron expressions, you can use the following tool to quickly verify the syntax and timing of your scheduled tasks to ensure they run as intended.\n\n#### Cron job validator\n\nUse the input below to validate a cron expression. A human readable version of the expression will be displayed when submitted.\n\nCron expression\n\nYou can also use [crontab guru](https://crontab.guru/) to validate your cron expressions.\n\n*   Cron jobs on Vercel do not support alternative expressions like `MON`, `SUN`, `JAN`, or `DEC`\n*   You cannot configure both day of the month and day of the week at the same time. When one has a value, the other must be `*`\n*   The timezone is always UTC",

This includes local development, preview deployments, and production deployments.\n\nFeature flags play a crucial role in the software development lifecycle, enabling safe feature rollouts, experimentation, and A/B testing. When you integrate your feature flags with the Vercel platform, you can improve your application by using Vercel's observability features.\n\nIf you're using Next.js App Router, or Sveltekit for your application, you have the option of implementing feature flags as code. This allows you to manage feature flags in your application codebase, including the ability to use feature flags in your routing logic through precomputed flags.\n\nAn Edge Config is a global data store that enables experimentation with feature flags, A/B testing, critical redirects, and IP blocking. It enables you to read data at the edge without querying an external database or hitting upstream servers. With [Vercel Integrations](https://vercel.com/docs/integrations), you can connect with external providers to synchronize their flags into your Edge Config.\n\nWith Vercel's optimizations, you can read Edge Config data at negligible latency. The vast majority of your reads will complete within 15ms at P99, or as low as 0ms in some scenarios.",

    "markdown": "# Quickstart for using the Vercel OpenTelemetry Collector\n\nVercel has an OpenTelemetry (OTEL) [collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/) that allows you to send OTEL traces from your Serverless or Edge Functions to application performance monitoring (APM) vendors such as [New Relic](https://vercel.com/integrations/newrelic).\n\nThe use of the OTEL collector is recommended due to improved performance, but not strictly required. If desired, you can configure the OTEL SDK to use [custom trace exporters](#custom-otel-exporters).\n\nTraces are a way to collect data about the performance and behavior of your application and help identify the cause of performance issues, errors, and other problems. Learn more about traces [in the OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/signals/traces/) docs.\n\nTo start using OpenTelemetry on Vercel, follow the steps below. This guide gives examples using Next.js and other frameworks where you can use Serverless or Edge Functions.\n\n*   You must be using an OTEL Integration:\n    *   [New Relic](https://vercel.com/integrations/newrelic): Available in [Beta](https://vercel.com/docs/release-phases#beta) to teams on Pro and Enterprise plans by following the steps below\n    *   [DataDog](https://vercel.com/integrations/datadog): Available in [Private Beta](https://vercel.com/docs/release-phases#private-beta) to teams on the Enterprise plan. To get access contact your CSM and follow the steps below\n\n1.  Select an integration from the Observability category in the [Marketplace](https://vercel.com/integrations#observability) (such as [DataDog](https://vercel.com/integrations/datadog) or [New Relic](https://vercel.com/integrations/newrelic)).\n    \n    Datadog integration support for OTEL is only available to teams on the Enterprise plan. You must contact your CSM to get access.\n    \n    Click the Add Integration button to begin the [installation](https://vercel.com/docs/integrations/using-an-integration/install-integration#marketplace) and follow each step to add the correct Scope.\n    \n    If you already have installed an OTEL integration, you can skip this step.\n    \n2.  To use OTEL, you must enable Traces for the Integration. You can do this either during initial setup, or if you already have the integration installed, select Manage next to the Integration in the Integrations tab and then select Configure.\n    \n3.  For JavaScript and Typescript users on Vercel, you can use the `@vercel/otel` package to call the correct OpenTelemetry SDK for you.\n    \n    Install the OpenTelemetry JavaScript SDK and `@vercel/otel`:\n    \n    ```\n    pnpm i @opentelemetry/api @vercel/otel\n    ```\n    \n    Create an `instrumentation.ts` file in the root of your project and add the following code to initialize and configure OTEL using `@vercel/otel`.\n    \n    ```\n    import { registerOTel } from '@vercel/otel';\n     \n    export function register() {\n      registerOTel({ serviceName: 'your-project-name' });\n    }\n    // NOTE: You can replace `your-project-name` with the actual name of your project\n    ```\n    \n    Before receiving traces from an APM vendor (such as DataDog), it may be necessary to first create the service you intend to use as a `serviceName` within the service catalog. Refer to the APM vendor's documentation for specific requirements.\n    \n4.  Next.js 13.4+ supports auto-instrumentation which means you no longer have to create a span for each request. To use this feature, you must explicitly opt-in by adding `experimental.instrumentationHook = true` to your `next.config.js`.\n    \n    For more information, please refer to the [Next.js docs for auto-instrumentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/open-telemetry).\n    \n5.  If you have an existing project, you must trigger a redeployment to use traces.\n    \n    You can either deploy your project through the [dashboard](https://vercel.com/new) or through the [CLI](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/overview#vercel-cli).\n    \n\nThe use of OTEL collector is recommended due to its performance benefits. However, if you need to export tracing to an unsupported APM vendor, you can do so using environment variables or configuration options in the `@vercel/otel` package.\n\nMost of OpenTelemetry's [SDK environment variables](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/configuration/sdk-environment-variables/) are supported by `@vercel/otel`, including [OTLP exporter variables](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/protocol/exporter/). You can configure these variables using Vercel's [environment variables](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables).\n\nAnd you can supply completely custom exporter using the `traceExporter` or `spanProcessors` configuration options in the `registerOTel()` API.\n\n```\nimport { registerOTel } from '@vercel/otel';\nimport { MyCustomExporter } from './my-custom-exporter';\n \nexport function register() {\n  registerOTel({\n    serviceName: 'your-project-name',\n    traceExporter: new MyCustomExporter(),\n  });\n}\n```",

    "markdown": "# Draft Mode\n\nDraft Mode lets you view your unpublished headless CMS content on your website rendered with all the normal styling and layout that you would see once published.\n\nBoth [Next.js](https://vercel.com/docs/frameworks/nextjs#draft-mode) and [SvelteKit](https://vercel.com/docs/frameworks/sveltekit#draft-mode) support Draft Mode. Any framework that uses the [Build Output API](https://vercel.com/docs/build-output-api/v3) can support Draft Mode by adding the `bypassToken` option to [prerender configuration](https://vercel.com/docs/build-output-api/v3/primitives#prerender-functions).\n\nDraft Mode was called Preview Mode before the release of Next.js [13.4](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-13-4) . The name was changed to avoid confusion with [preview deployments](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/preview-deployments), which is a different product.\n\nYou can use Draft Mode if you:\n\n1.  Use [Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)](https://vercel.com/docs/incremental-static-regeneration) to fetch and render data from a headless CMS\n2.  Want to view your unpublished headless CMS content on your site without rebuilding your pages when you make changes\n3.  Want to protect your unpublished content from being viewed publicly\n\nDraft Mode allows you to bypass [ISR](https://vercel.com/docs/incremental-static-regeneration) caching to fetch the latest CMS content at request time. This is useful for seeing your draft content on your website without waiting for the cache to refresh, or manually revalidating the page.\n\nThe process works like this:\n\n1.  Each ISR route has a `bypassToken` configuration option, which is assigned a generated, cryptographically-secure value at build time\n2.  When someone visits an ISR route with a `bypassToken` configured, the page will check for a `__prerender_bypass` cookie\n3.  If the `__prerender_bypass` cookie exists and has the same value as the `bypassToken` your project is using, the visitor will view the page in Draft Mode\n\nOnly team members will be able to view pages in Draft Mode.\n\nTo use Draft Mode with Next.js on Vercel, you must:\n\n1.  [Enable ISR](https://vercel.com/docs/incremental-static-regeneration) on pages that fetch content. Using ISR is required on pages that you want to view in Draft Mode\n    \n2.  Add code to your ISR pages to detect when Draft Mode is enabled and render the draft content\n    \n3.  Toggle Draft Mode in the Vercel Toolbar by selecting the eye icon to view your draft content. Once toggled, the toolbar will turn purple, indicating that Draft Mode is enabled\n    \n    ```\n    import { draftMode } from 'next/headers';\n     \n    async function getContent() {\n      const { isEnabled } = draftMode();\n     \n      const contentUrl = isEnabled\n        ? 'https://draft.example.com'\n        : 'https://production.example.com';\n     \n      // This line enables ISR, required for draft mode\n      const res = await fetch(contentUrl, { next: { revalidate: 120 } });\n     \n      return res.json();\n    }\n     \n    export default async function Page() {\n      const { title, desc } = await getContent();\n     \n      return (\n        <main>\n          <h1>{title}</h1>\n          <p>{desc}</p>\n        </main>\n      );\n    }\n    ```\n    \n\nSee the Next.js docs to learn how to use Draft Mode with self-hosted Next.js projects:\n\nYou will be able to access Draft Mode in the Vercel Toolbar through the eye icon. Once selected, the toolbar will turn purple, indicating that Draft Mode is enabled:\n\n![The Vercel Toolbar with Draft Mode enabled](https://vercel.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.vercel.com%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1716539135%2Ffront%2Fdocs%2Fvercel-toolbar%2Ftoolbar-draft-mode.png&w=1080&q=75&dpl=dpl_6RGLzPaeBNhuWHRxN1xTYtAhKUa3)![The Vercel Toolbar with Draft Mode enabled](https://vercel.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.vercel.com%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1716539135%2Ffront%2Fdocs%2Fvercel-toolbar%2Ftoolbar-draft-mode.png&w=1080&q=75&dpl=dpl_6RGLzPaeBNhuWHRxN1xTYtAhKUa3)\n\nThe Vercel Toolbar with Draft Mode enabled\n\nTo share a draft URL, it must have the `?__vercel_draft=1` query parameter.

Checks API defines your application's quality metrics, runs end-to-end tests, investigates APIs' reliability, and checks your deployment.\n\nMost testing and CI/CD flows occur in synthetic environments. This leads to false results, overlooked performance degradation, and missed broken connections.\n\n| Flow Type | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Core | Checks `200` responses on specific pages or APIs. Determine the deployment's health and identify issues with code, errors, or broken connections |\n| Performance | Collects [core web vital](https://vercel.com/docs/speed-insights) information for specific pages and compares it with the new deployment. It helps you decide whether to build the deployment or block it for further investigation |\n| End-to-end | Validates that your deployment has all the required components to build successfully.

When a [deployment](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/overview) is created, Vercel triggers the `deployment.created` webhook. This tells integrators that checks can now be registered\n2.  Next, an integrator uses the Checks API to create checks defined in the integration configuration\n3.  When the deployment is built, Vercel triggers the `deployment.ready` webhook. This notifies integrators to begin checks on the deployment\n4.  Vercel waits until all the created checks receive an update\n5.  Once all checks receive a `conclusion`, aliases will apply, and the deployment will go live\n\nLearn more about this process in the [Anatomy of Checks API](https://vercel.com/docs/integrations/checks-overview/creating-checks)\n\nYou can build your Checks [integration](https://vercel.com/docs/integrations/create-integration) and [publish](https://vercel.com/docs/integrations/create-integration/submit-integration) it to the [integration marketplace](https://vercel.com/marketplace). Your integration should follow these guidelines:\n\n*   Provide low or no configuration solutions for developers to run checks\n*   A guided onboarding process for developers from the installation to the end result\n*   Provide relevant information about the outcome of the test on the Vercel dashboard\n*   Document how to go beyond the default behavior to build custom tests for advanced users",

The form has the following fields:\n\nOnce you have created your integration, it will be assigned the [Community badge](https://vercel.com/docs/integrations/create-integration#community-badge) and be available for external users to download. You can share it with users either through your site or through the Vercel [deploy button](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/deploy-button/integrations).\n\nIf you are interested in having your integration listed on the [Integration Marketplace](https://vercel.com/integrations):\n\n*   The integration must have at least 500 active installations (500 accounts that have the integration installed).\n*   The integration follows our [review guidelines](https://vercel.com/docs/integrations/create-integration/approval-checklist).\n*   Once you've reached this minimum install requirement, please email [integrations@vercel.com](mailto:integrations@vercel.com) with your request to be reviewed for listing.\n\nYou can view all integrations that you have created on the [Integrations Console](https://vercel.com/dashboard/integrations/console).\n\nTo preview an integration's live URL, click View Integration. This URL can be shared for installation based on the integration's visibility settings.\n\nThe live URL has the following format:\n\n```\nhttps://vercel.com/integrations/<slug>\n```\n\nWhere, `<slug>` is the name you specified in the URL Slug field during the integration creation process.\n\nIn the [Integrations Console](https://vercel.com/dashboard/integrations/console), a Community badge will appear under your new integration's title once you have submitted the integration. While integrations with a Community badge do not appear in the [marketplace](https://vercel.com/integrations), they are available to be installed through your site or through the Vercel [deploy button](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/deploy-button/integrations)\n\nCommunity integrations are developed by third parties and are supported solely by the developers. Before installing, review the developer's Privacy Policy and End User License Agreement on the integration page.\n\nThe installation of the integration is a critical component of the developer experience that must cater to all types of developers. While deciding the installation flow you should consider the following:\n\n*   New user flow: Developers should be able to create an account on your service while installing the integration\n*   Existing user flow: With existing accounts, developers should sign in as they install the integration. Also, make sure the forgotten password flow doesn't break the installation flow\n*   Strong defaults: The installation flow should have minimal steps and have set defaults whenever possible\n*   Advanced settings: Provide developers with the ability to override or expand settings when installing the integration\n\nFor the installation flow, you should consider adding the following specs:\n\n| Spec Name | Required | Spec Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Documentation | Yes | Explain the integration and how to use it. Also explain the defaults and how to override them. |\n| Deploy Button | No  | Create a [Deploy Button](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/deploy-button) for projects based on a Git repository. |\n\nAs an integration creator, you are solely responsible for the support of your integration developed and listed on Vercel.

    "markdown": "# Security & Compliance Measures\n\nThis page covers the protection and compliance measures Vercel takes to ensure the security of your data, including [DDoS mitigation](https://vercel.com/docs/security/ddos-mitigation), [SOC2 Type 2 compliance](#soc2), [Data encryption](#data-encryption), and more.\n\nSystem and Organization Control 2 Type 2 ([SOC 2](https://www.aicpa-cima.com/topic/audit-assurance/audit-and-assurance-greater-than-soc-2)) is a compliance framework developed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants ([AICPA](https://us.aicpa.org/forthepublic)) that focuses on how an organization's services remain secure and protect customer data. The framework contains 5 Trust Services Categories ([TSCs](https://www.schellman.com/blog/soc-examinations/soc-2-trust-services-criteria-with-tsc)), which contain criteria to evaluate the controls and service commitments of an organization.\n\nVercel has a SOC 2 Type 2 attestation for Security, Confidentiality, and Availability.\n\nMore information is available at [security.vercel.com](https://security.vercel.com/).\n\nISO 27001 is an internationally recognized standard, developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), that provides organizations with a systematic approach to securing confidential company and customer information.\n\nVercel is ISO 27001:2013 certified. Our certificate is available [here](https://www.schellman.com/certificate-directory?certificateNumber=1868222-1).\n\nThe EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), is a comprehensive data protection law that governs the use, sharing, transfer, and processing of EU personal data. For UK personal data, the provisions of the EU GDPR have been incorporated into UK law as the UK GDPR\n\nVercel supports GDPR compliance, which means that we commit to the following:\n\n*   Implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational security measures surrounding customer data\n*   Notify our customers without undue delay of any data breaches\n*   Impose similar data protection obligations on our sub-processors as we do for ourselves\n*   Respond to applicable [data subjects rights](https://vercel.com/legal/privacy-policy#eea), including requests for access, correction, and/or deletion of their personal data\n*   Rely on the EU Standard Contractual Clauses and the UK Addendum as valid data transfer mechanisms when transferring personal data outside the EEA\n\nFor more information on how Vercel protects your personal data, and the data of your customers, refer to our [Privacy Policy](https://vercel.com/legal/privacy-policy) and [Data Processing Addendum](https://vercel.com/legal/dpa).\n\nPayment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is a standard that defines the security and privacy requirements for payment card processing. PCI compliance requires that businesses who handle customer credit card information adhere to a set of information security standards.\n\nIn alignment with Vercel’s [shared responsibility model](https://vercel.com/docs/security/shared-responsibility), Vercel serves as a service provider to customers who process payment and cardholder data. Customers should select an appropriate payment gateway provider to integrate an `iframe` into their application to ensure that any information entered in the `iframe` goes directly to their payment processor and is isolated from their application’s managed infrastructure on Vercel.\n\n[Learn about PCI DSS iframe integration](https://vercel.com/docs/security/pci-dss).\n\nVercel provides a Self-Assessment Questionnaire D (SAQ-D) Attestation of Compliance (AOC) (SAQ-D AOC) under [PCI DSS v3.2.1](https://docs-prv.pcisecuritystandards.org/PCI%20DSS/Standard/PCI-DSS-v3-2-1-r1.pdf) for service providers. This is crucial for customers handling payments through their applications, as it may affect the scope of their cardholder data environment per PCI DSS standards. The SAQ-D AOC certifies Vercel's adherence to PCI DSS requirements as a service provider.\n\n[Contact us](https://vercel.com/contact/sales) for more details or to access the SAQ-D AOC report.\n\nThe [Health Information Portability and Accountability Act](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/) (HIPAA) is one of the most important sectoral regulations related to privacy within the United States (US). The Secretary for the [Health and Human Services](https://www.hhs.gov/) (HHS) developed a set of required national standards designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of health data. Certain businesses, covered entities and business associates, are required to comply to these regulations to ensure that health data is transmitted without compromising its security.\n\nVercel supports HIPAA compliance as a business associate by committing to the following:\n\n*   Implementing and maintaining appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to safeguard a customer's [Protected Health Information](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/laws-regulations/index.html#:~:text=Information%20is%20Protected-,Protected%20Health%20Information.,health%20information%20(PHI).%22) (PHI)\n*   Notifying customers of any data breaches without undue delay\n*   Signing Business Associate Agreements (BAAs) with enterprise customers\n\nCustomers subject to HIPAA may enable [Vercel Secure Compute (available on Enterprise plans)](https://vercel.com/docs/security/secure-compute) for additional layers of protection. This allows customers to have more control over which resources they allow to have access to their information through:\n\n*   Private, isolated cloud environments\n*   Dedicated outgoing IP addresses\n\n[VPC peering and VPN support](https://vercel.com/docs/security/secure-compute#vpc-or-vpn-support) (built on top of Secure Compute) allows customers to create fewer entry points into their networks by establishing secure tunnels within their AWS infrastructure.\n\n[Learn](https://security.vercel.com/?itemUid=aec41c33-0f3a-4030-ac59-49adfd4a975b&source=click) about how Vercel supports HIPAA compliance.\n\n[Contact us](https://vercel.com/contact/sales/security) to request a BAA or to add Secure Compute to your plan.\n\nThe EU-U.S [Data Privacy Framework](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/) (DPF) provides U.S. organizations a reliable mechanism for transferring personal data from the European Union (EU), United Kingdom (UK), and Switzerland to the United States (U.S.) while ensuring data protection that is consistent with EU, UK, and Swiss law.\n\nThe International Trade Administration (ITA) within the U.S. Department of Commerce administers the DPF program, enabling eligible U.S.-based organizations to certify their compliance with the framework.\n\nVercel is certified under the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework. To view our public listing, visit the [Data Privacy Framework website](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/list).\n\nVercel's certification provides adequate data protection for transferring personal data outside of the EU, UK, and Switzerland under the EU/UK [General Data Protection Regulation](https://gdpr-info.eu/) (GDPR) and UK Data Protection Act 2018, as well as the [Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2022/491/en) (FADP).\n\n[Learn more](https://security.vercel.com/?itemName=data_privacy&source=click) about Vercel's data privacy practices or visit our [Privacy Notice](https://vercel.com/legal/privacy-policy) for more information.\n\nThe Vercel Edge Network and deployment platform primarily uses Amazon Web Services (AWS), and currently has [18 different regions](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/regions) and an Anycast network with global IP addresses.\n\nWe use a multi-layered security approach that combines people, processes, and technology, including centralized IAM, to regulate access to production resources.\n\nWe use cloud security processes to develop and implement procedures for provisioning, configuring, managing, monitoring, and accessing cloud resources. Any changes made in production environments are managed through change control using Infrastructure as Code (IaC).\n\nTo ensure always-on security, Vercel's edge infrastructure uses a combination of cloud-native and vendor tooling, including cloud security posture management tooling for continuous scanning and alerting.\n\nWhen an AWS outage occurs in a region, Vercel will automatically route traffic to the nearest available edge, ensuring network resilience.\n\nVercel operates on a shared responsibility model with customers. Customers have the ability to select their preferred region for deploying their code. The default location for serverless functions is the U.S., but there are dozens of [regions](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/regions#region-list) globally that can be used.\n\nAdditionally, Vercel may transfer data to and in the United States and anywhere else in the world where Vercel or its service providers maintain data processing operations. Please see Vercel's [Data Processing Addendum](https://vercel.com/legal/dpa) for further details.\n\n*   Vercel uses [AWS Global Accelerator](https://aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/) and our Anycast network to automatically reroute traffic to another region in case of regional failure\n*   [Vercel Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/configuring-functions/region#automatic-failover) have multiple availability zone redundancy by default. Multi-region redundancy is available depending on your runtime\n*   Our core database and data plane is a globally replicated database with rapid manual failover, using multiple availability zones\n\nWith region-based failover, Vercel data is replicated across multiple regions, and a failover is triggered when an outage occurs in a region. Rapid failover is then provided to secondary regions, allowing users continuous access to critical applications and services with minimal disruption.\n\nTo meet RTO/RPO goals, Vercel conducts recurring resiliency testing. This testing simulates regional failures. Throughout testing, service statuses are also monitored to benchmark recovery time, and alert on any disruptions.\n\nVercel encrypts data at rest (when on disk) with 256 bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES-256). While data is in transit (on route between source and destination), Vercel uses HTTPS/TLS 1.3.\n\nIf you need isolated runtime infrastructure, you can use [Vercel Secure Compute](https://vercel.com/docs/security/secure-compute) to create a private, isolated cloud environment with dedicated outgoing IP addresses.\n\nVercel backs-up customer data at an interval of every hour, each backup is persisted for 30 days, and is globally replicated for resiliency against regional disasters. Automatic backups are taken without affecting the performance or availability of the database operations.\n\nAll backups are stored separately in a storage service. If a database instance is deleted, all associated backups are also automatically deleted. Backups are periodically tested by the Vercel engineering team.\n\nThese backups are not available to customers and are created for Vercel's infrastructure's use in case of disaster.\n\nEnterprise Teams on Vercel have their own build infrastructure ensuring isolation from Hobby/Pro accounts on Vercel.\n\nVercel conducts regular penetration testing through third-party penetration testers, and has daily code reviews and static analysis checks.",

This can significantly improve Time To First Byte for second time visitors.\n\nTo ensure clients can validate TLS certificates as quickly as possible, we [staple an OCSP response](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCSP_stapling) allowing them to skip a network request to check for revocation, which improves TTFB for first-time visitors.\n\nIn order to ensure the integrity of the data received and sent by any Deployment running on the Vercel platform, we only support strong ciphers with [forward secrecy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_secrecy).\n\nThe following cipher algorithms are supported:\n\n*   `TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256` (TLS 1.3)\n*   `TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384` (TLS 1.3)\n*   `TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256` (TLS 1.3)\n*   `ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256` (TLS 1.2)\n*   `ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256` (TLS 1.2)\n*   `ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384` (TLS 1.2)\n*   `ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384` (TLS 1.2)\n*   `ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305` (TLS 1.2)\n*   `ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305` (TLS 1.2)\n*   `DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384` (TLS 1.2)\n\nThis is the [recommended configuration from Mozilla](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS#Intermediate_compatibility_.28recommended.29).\n\nThe `.vercel.app` domain (and therefore all of its sub domains, which are the unique URLs set when creating a deployment) support [HSTS](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security) automatically and are preloaded.\n\n```\nStrict-Transport-Security: max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload;\n```\n\nThe default `Strict-Transport-Security` header for \\*.vercel.app\n\nCustom domains use HSTS, but only for the particular subdomain.\n\n```\nStrict-Transport-Security: max-age=63072000;\n```\n\nThe default `Strict-Transport-Security` header for custom domains\n\nYou can modify the `Strict-Transport-Security` header by configuring [custom response headers](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/headers#custom-response-headers) in your project.\n\nTheoretically, you could set the `max-age` parameter to a different value (it indicates how long the client should remember that your site is only accessible over HTTPS), but since we do not allow connections made over HTTP, there is no point in setting it to a shorter value, as the client can just remember it forever.\n\nYou can test whether your site qualifies for HSTS Preloading [here](https://hstspreload.org/) . It also allows submitting the domain to Google Chrome's hardcoded HSTS list. Making it onto that list means your site will become even faster, as it is always accessed over HTTPS right away, instead of the browser following the redirection issued by our **Network** layer.\n\nThe unique URLs generated when creating a deployment are handled using a wildcard certificate issued for the `.vercel.app` domain. The Vercel platform generates wildcard certificates using [LetsEncrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) and keeps them updated automatically.\n\nWhen custom certificates are generated using `vercel certs issue`, however, their keys are placed in our database and [encrypted at rest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_at_rest#Encryption) within the Network layer.\n\nThen, once a hostname is requested, the certificate and key are read from the database and used for establishing the secure connection. In addition, both are cached in memory for optimal SSL termination performance.\n\nAny features of the encryption mechanism that were left uncovered are documented on [SSL Labs](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=vercel.com). You only need to make sure to select any IP address of your choice (it does not matter which one you pick – the results are the same for all).",

    "markdown": "# Shared Responsibility Model\n\nDiscover the essentials of our Shared Responsibility Model, outlining the key roles and responsibilities for customers, Vercel, and shared aspects in ensuring secure and efficient cloud computing services.\n\nA shared responsibility model is a framework designed to split tasks and obligations between two groups in cloud computing. The model divides duties to ensure security, maintenance, and service functionality.\n\nWhen using a cloud platform such as Vercel, it is important to understand where your security responsibilities lie, and where Vercel takes responsibility. This is especially important when it comes to handling data, such as user account information, payment details, source code and other sensitive information.\n\nThe customer handles their data, applications, and user access management. This includes data encryption, safeguarding sensitive information, and assigning appropriate permissions to users.\n\nVercel manages infrastructure components, such as compute, storage, and networking. Our role is to guarantee that the platform is secure, dependable, and maintained.\n\n![The shared responsibility model for Vercel.](https://vercel.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.vercel.com%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1689795055%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Fsecurity%2Fshared-responsibility-model-light-mode.png&w=3840&q=75&dpl=dpl_6RGLzPaeBNhuWHRxN1xTYtAhKUa3)![The shared responsibility model for Vercel.](https://vercel.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.vercel.com%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1689795055%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Fsecurity%2Fshared-responsibility-model-dark-mode.png&w=3840&q=75&dpl=dpl_6RGLzPaeBNhuWHRxN1xTYtAhKUa3)\n\nThe shared responsibility model for Vercel.\n\n*   Security Requirements Assessment: Customers are responsible for evaluating and deciding whether Vercel's platform and the security protection provided meet the specific needs and requirements for their application. By choosing to use our platform, customers acknowledge and accept the level of security coverage offered by Vercel\n    *   Handling Malicious Traffic: Customers are responsible for addressing any costs and resource consumption related to malicious traffic. They should assess their security requirements and implement additional safeguards beyond the [protections](https://vercel.com/docs/security) provided by Vercel\n    *   Payment Transactions: Customers subject to PCI DSS compliance are responsible for choosing an appropriate payment gateway provider to integrate an [iframe into their application](https://vercel.com/docs/security/pci-dss).\n*   Client-side Data: Customers are responsible for the security and management of data on their clients' devices\n*   Source Code: Customers are responsible for securely storing, and maintaining their source code at all times\n*   Server-side Encryption: Customers are responsible for encrypting their server-side data, whether it's stored in the file system or in a database\n*   Identity & Access Management (IAM): Customers choose and implement their desired level of access control regarding their IAM configuration with tools provided by Vercel\n*   Region Selection for Compute: Customers are responsible for selecting the appropriate regions for their compute resources based on their requirements and compliance needs\n*   Production Checklist: Customers are responsible for implementing and adhering to recommended best practices provided in [Vercel's production checklist](https://vercel.com/docs/production-checklist). The customer must ensure these guidelines for optimizing application performance and security are properly followed and integrated into their application's development and deployment processes\n*   Spend Management: Customers are responsible for enabling [Spend Management](https://vercel.com/docs/accounts/spend-management) to set spend a reasonable spend amount and configure actions based on the amount as needed\n\n*   Information and Data: Customers control and own their data. By design, customers determine the access to their data and are responsible for securing and protecting it while in their possession. Vercel does not have visibility into customers' data until they provide it to us. Once in our possession, it is our responsibility to protect and secure it. This shared responsibility ensures the safety and privacy of our customers' data\n    *   Integrations: Customers are responsible for deciding which Vercel services to use and the data that is collected or needed to provide those services. This includes making choices about optional features such as [monitoring](https://vercel.com/docs/observability/monitoring) and [analytics](https://vercel.com/docs/analytics), which give customers more information about their end users. Integrations with third-party services should also be considered in this context, as they can impact the data collected and shared\n*   Encryption & Data Integrity: Vercel is responsible for [encryption](https://vercel.com/docs/security/encryption) and data integrity for data in transit (when in motion between systems or locations) and at rest for the services Vercel controls. However, customers must ensure that all integrations and third-party services used to interact with Vercel are properly secured. This includes proxies, WAFs, CMSs, and integrations with other third-party services\n    *   User Code & Environment Variables: Customers are responsible for managing their application's code, including the exposure of [environment variables](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables). By providing code and setting environment variables, customers authorize Vercel to build and deploy their application based on the provided parameters. It is essential for customers to ensure proper handling of sensitive information, such as API keys or other secrets, to maintain the security of their application and data\n*   Authentication: Customers handle their app's authentication with tools like [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/introduction). Vercel manages platform authentication and provides [deployment protection](https://vercel.com/docs/security/deployment-protection) to help secure the platform for Pro and Hobby users, who authenticate using the [CLI](https://vercel.com/docs/cli/login). Enterprise users can access Single Sign-On (SSO). Vercel deployments can be protected in the following ways: [Vercel Authentication](https://vercel.com/docs/security/deployment-protection/methods-to-protect-deployments/vercel-authentication), [SSO](https://vercel.com/docs/security/saml), or [Password Protection](https://vercel.com/docs/security/deployment-protection/methods-to-protect-deployments/password-protection)\n*   Log Management: While Vercel provides access to short-term [runtime logs](https://vercel.com/docs/observability/runtime-logs) for debugging purposes, it is the customer's responsibility to set up [log drains](https://vercel.com/docs/observability/log-drains) for long-term log retention, data auditing, or additional visibility into their application's performance\n\n*   Infrastructure: Vercel is responsible for the security and availability of the underlying infrastructure used to provide our services. Vercel maintains strict security protocols and regularly performs upgrades to ensure that our infrastructure is up to date and secure\n    *   Multiple Availability Zones and Globally Located Edge Locations: Vercel makes use of [18 different regions](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/regions), which are strategically placed around the globe to provide fast and reliable content delivery to customers\n*   Compute: Vercel provides a compute environment for customer applications that utilizes serverless functions and containers to ensure the secure execution of customer code and middleware. Industry-standard security practices are used to isolate customer applications and ensure they are not impacted by other applications running on the platform\n*   Storage: Vercel is responsible for the security and reliability of storage environments for customer data. This includes the storage of application code, configuration files, and other data required to run customer applications. Vercel uses industry-standard encryption and access controls to ensure that customer data is protected from unauthorized access\n*   Networking: Vercel is responsible for providing a secure and reliable networking environment for customer applications. This includes the network infrastructure used to connect customer applications to the internet, as well as the firewalls and other security measures used to protect them from unauthorized access. Industry-standard security practices are used to monitor network traffic and detect and respond to potential security threats",

Depending on your use case, you can choose to protect a single environment, or multiple environments. See [Understanding Deployment Protection by environment](https://vercel.com/docs/security/deployment-protection#understanding-deployment-protection-by-environment) for more information.\n\nYou can see an overview of your projects' protections in the following way\n\n1.

Users with this link can see the latest deployment and leave [comments](https://vercel.com/docs/workflow-collaboration/comments) (if enabled and logged in with their Vercel account).\n\nFor example, if you generate a Sharable Link for the `feature-new-ui` branch. Users with this link can view the latest deployment and comment.\n\nLearn more about [Sharable Links](https://vercel.com/docs/security/deployment-protection/methods-to-bypass-deployment-protection/sharable-links), and how to generate and revoke them.\n\nFor automated tasks like end-to-end (E2E) testing, you can use Protection bypass for Automation. When enabled, it generates a secret that can be used as a System Environment Variable (`VERCEL_AUTOMATION_BYPASS_SECRET`) to bypass protection features for all deployments in a project.\n\nFor example, you set up E2E tests that run on deployments. By using this feature and the generated secret, your tests can bypass the protection mechanisms.\n\nLearn more about [Protection bypass for Automation](https://vercel.com/docs/security/deployment-protection/methods-to-bypass-deployment-protection/protection-bypass-automation), and how to enable and disable it.\n\nWith Deployment Protection Exceptions you can specify preview domains that should be exempt from deployment protection. Adding a domain to Deployment Protection Exceptions makes it publicly accessible, bypassing features like [Vercel Authentication](https://vercel.com/docs/security/deployment-protection/methods-to-protect-deployments/vercel-authentication), [Password Protection](https://vercel.com/docs/security/deployment-protection/methods-to-protect-deployments/password-protection), and [Trusted IPs](https://vercel.com/docs/security/deployment-protection/methods-to-protect-deployments/trusted-ips).\n\nFor example, if you add `preview-branch-name.vercel.app` to Deployment Protection Exceptions, this domain becomes publicly accessible, bypassing the project's deployment protection settings. When removed, it reverts to the default protection settings.\n\nLearn more about [Deployment Protection Exceptions](https://vercel.com/docs/security/deployment-protection/methods-to-bypass-deployment-protection/deployment-protection-exceptions), and how to add and remove domains.\n\nWith OPTIONS Allowlist you can specify paths to be unprotected for preflight OPTIONS requests. This can be used to enable [CORS preflight](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Preflight_request) requests to your project's protected deployments, as browsers do not send authentication on preflight requests.\n\nIncoming request paths will be compared with the paths in the allowlist, if a request path starts with one of the specified paths, and has the method `OPTIONS`, it will bypass Deployment Protection.\n\nFor example, if you specify `/api`, all requests to paths that start with `/api` (such as `/api/v1/users` and `/api/v2/projects`) will be unprotected for any `OPTIONS` request.\n\nLearn more about [OPTIONS Allowlist](https://vercel.com/docs/security/deployment-protection/methods-to-bypass-deployment-protection/options-allowlist).",

Code owners who are higher up in the directory tree act as broader stewards over the codebase and are the fallback if owners files go out of date, such as when developers switch teams\n*   Customizable code review algorithms: Modifiers allow organizations to tailor their code review process to their needs.

This URL is publicly accessible by default, but you can configure it to be private using [deployment protection](https://vercel.com/docs/security/deployment-protection). The URL is structured as so:\n\n```\n<project-name>-<unique-hash>-<scope-slug>.vercel.app\n```\n\nYou can use this URL to access a particular deployment forever. It will never cease to exist and can therefore be used as part of a revision history.\n\nYou can access these automatically generated URLs in the following ways:\n\n*   On the command line when the build has completed.\n*   When using Git, you have two options to access deployment URLs. Firstly, you can access the generated URL for a specific deployment within your pull request. Alternatively, you can view a URL that displays [the latest build](#url-with-git-branch).

You can refresh the generated URL associated with the Git branch.\n\nThe structure of the URL will be as follows:\n\n```\n<project-name>-git-<branch-name>-<scope-slug>.vercel.app\n```\n\nTo access the URL for a successful deployment from Vercel CLI, you can save the [standard output of the deploy command](https://vercel.com/docs/cli/deploy#standard-output-usage). The generated URL will have the following structure:\n\n```\n<project-name>-<scope-slug>.vercel.app;\n```\n\nOnce you deploy to the production environment, the above URL will point to the production deployment.\n\nIf the deployment is created on a [Team](https://vercel.com/docs/accounts/create-a-team), you can also use the URL specific to the deployment's author. It will have the following structure:\n\n```\n<project-name>-<author-name>-<scope-slug>.vercel.app;\n```\n\nThis allows you to easily stay on top of the latest change deployed by a particular [Member](https://vercel.com/docs/accounts/team-members-and-roles) of a Team within a specific Project.\n\nIf more than 63 characters are present before the `.vercel.app` suffix (or the respective [Preview Deployment Suffix](#preview-deployment-suffix)) for a generated URL, they will be truncated.\n\nFor example, this is what an [Automatic Branch URL](#url-with-git-branch) could look like:\n\n```\nmy-project-git-this-is-really-an-extremely-long-bra-abc123xyz-scope-slug.vercel.app;\n```\n\nThe truncation happens by taking away from the end of this list of characters until only 56 of them remain.\n\nAfterward, the first 6-characters of an SHA-256 hash prefix, the Git branch, and the Project name preceded by a dash (like `-ar63fm`) will be appended at the end to avoid collision with other generated URLs that may also be truncated.\n\nThe hash prefix will either be `git-`, or `git-fork-` if the deployment was created through a fork. In the end, the hash creation might look like this:\n\n```\nconst prefix = isFork ? 'git-fork-' : 'git-';\nsha256(prefix + branch + projectName).slice(0, 6);\n```\n\nOnce the truncation is complete, the list of characters will be exactly 63 and therefore comply with the limit.\n\nIf your `<project-name>` resembles a regular web domain, it may be shortened to avoid that resemblance. For example, `www-company-com` would be changed to just `company`. This is done to prevent an accidental trigger of anti-phishing protection built into web browsers that protect the user from visiting domains that look roughly like other domains they visit.\n\nLastly, suppose a [Preview Deployment Suffix](#preview-deployment-suffix) is configured, and the entire generated URL exceeds 253 characters. In that case, the same truncation as mentioned above applies. Still, instead of 63 characters, the length limit will be 253 minus the length of the Preview Deployment Suffix plus 1 (for the period that precedes the Preview Deployment Suffix).\n\nFor example, if the domain `acme-previews.com` is configured as the Preview Deployment Suffix. In that case, that domain has a length of 17, including the preceding `.`, the character limit that would apply before the suffix is 18.\n\nPreview Deployment Suffixes allow you to customize the URL of a [preview deployment](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/overview#preview-deployments) by replacing the default `vercel.app` suffix with a [custom domain](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/domains/add-a-domain) of your choice.\n\nThe entered custom domain must be:\n\n*   Available and active within the team that enabled the Preview Deployment Suffix\n*   Using Vercel's [Nameservers](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/domains/add-a-domain#vercel-nameservers)\n\nTo enable Preview Deployment Suffix, and customize the appearance of any of your generated URLs:\n\n1.  From your [dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard), select the Settings tab\n2.  Select the Billing tab\n3.  Under Add-Ons, set the toggle for Preview Deployment Suffix to Enabled\n4.  Navigate to the Settings tab on the team dashboard\n5.  Select the General tab and scroll down to the Preview Deployment Suffix section\n6.  Enter the custom domain of your choice in the input, and push Save\n\n![Selecting a custom value for the Preview Deployment Suffix.](https://vercel.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.vercel.com%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1689795055%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Fconcepts%2Fdeployments%2Fpreview-deployment-suffix-light.png&w=1920&q=75&dpl=dpl_6RGLzPaeBNhuWHRxN1xTYtAhKUa3)![Selecting a custom value for the Preview Deployment Suffix.](https://vercel.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.vercel.com%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1689795055%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Fconcepts%2Fdeployments%2Fpreview-deployment-suffix-dark.png&w=1920&q=75&dpl=dpl_6RGLzPaeBNhuWHRxN1xTYtAhKUa3)\n\nSelecting a custom value for the Preview Deployment Suffix.\n\nIf you are not able to use Vercel's Nameservers, see our guide on [how to use a custom domain without Vercel's Nameservers](https://vercel.com/guides/preview-deployment-suffix-without-vercel-nameservers).\n\nSee the [plans add-ons](https://vercel.com/docs/accounts/plans/pro#pro-plan-add-ons) documentation for information on pricing.\n\nTo disable Preview Deployment Suffix:\n\n1.  From your [dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard), select the Settings tab\n2.  Select the Billing tab\n3.  Under Add-Ons, set the toggle for Preview Deployment Suffix to Disabled\n\nThe next preview deployment generated will revert back to the default `vercel.app` suffix.\n\nYou may encounter this error if you are using the [Preview Deployment Suffix](#preview-deployment-suffix) in your team. Make sure that the custom domain you configured is:\n\n*   Active (not deleted)\n*   Available within the team that enabled the [Preview Deployment Suffix](#preview-deployment-suffix)\n*   Backed by an [active wildcard certificate](https://knowledge.digicert.com/generalinformation/INFO900.html)\n\nThe best way to satisfy all of these constraints is to ensure the domain is also added to a project located in the same team. In this project, you can include a single `index.html` that displays when someone visits the root of the domain.",

Vercel adds these prefixes automatically for your production and preview deployments, but not for your local development environment.\n\nFramework environment variables are not prefixed when pulled into your local development environment with `vercel env pull`. For example, `VERCEL_ENV` will not be prefixed to `NEXT_PUBLIC_VERCEL_ENV`.\n\nTo use framework-prefixed environment variables locally:\n\n1.  [Define them in your project settings](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables#declare-an-environment-variable) with the appropriate prefix\n2.  Scope them to `Development`\n3.

    "markdown": "# OIDC Federation Reference\n\nVercel provides helper libraries to make it easier to exchange the OIDC token for short-lived credentials with your cloud provider. They are available from the [@vercel/functions package on npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vercel/functions).\n\n`awsCredentialsProvider()` is a helper function that returns a function that can be used as the `credentials` property of the AWS SDK client. It exchanges the OIDC token for short-lived credentials with AWS by calling the `AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity` operation.\n\n```\nimport { awsCredentialsProvider } from '@vercel/functions/oidc';\nimport * as s3 from '@aws-sdk/client-s3';\n \nconst s3client = new s3.S3Client({\n  region: proces.env.AWS_REGION!,\n  credentials: awsCredentialsProvider({\n    roleArn: process.env.AWS_ROLE_ARN!,\n  }),\n});\n```\n\n`getVercelOidcToken()` returns the OIDC token from the `VERCEL_OIDC_TOKEN` environment variable in builds and local development environments or the `x-vercel-oidc-token` in serverless functions.\n\n```\nimport { getVercelOidcToken } from '@vercel/functions/oidc';\nimport { ClientAssertionCredential } from '@azure/identity';\nimport { CosmosClient } from '@azure/cosmos';\n \nconst credentialsProvider = new ClientAssertionCredential(\n  process.env.AZURE_TENANT_ID,\n  process.env.AZURE_CLIENT_ID,\n  getVercelOidcToken,\n);\n \nconst cosmosClient = new CosmosClient({\n  endpoint: process.env.COSMOS_DB_ENDPOINT,\n  aadCredentials: credentialsProvider,\n});\n```\n\nIn the serverless function environments, you cannot execute the `getVercelOidcToken()` function directly at the module level because the token is only available in the `Request` object as the `x-vercel-oidc-token` header.\n\nIf you change the name of your team or project, the claims within the OIDC token will reflect the new names. This can affect your trust and access control policies. You should consider this when you plan to rename your team or project and update your policies accordingly.\n\nAWS roles can support multiple conditions so you can allow access to both the old and new team and project names. Here is an example:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n  \"Statement\": [\n    {\n      \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n      \"Principal\": {\n        \"Federated\": \"arn:aws:iam::[YOUR AWS ACCOUNT ID]:oidc-provider/oidc.vercel.com\"\n      },\n      \"Action\": \"sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity\",\n      \"Condition\": {\n        \"StringEquals\": {\n          \"oidc.vercel.com:aud\": [\n            \"https://vercel.com/[OLD_TEAM_SLUG]\",\n            \"https://vercel.com/[NEW_TEAM_SLUG]\"\n          ],\n          \"oidc.vercel.com:sub\": [\n            \"owner:[OLD_TEAM_SLUG]:project:[OLD_PROJECT_NAME]:environment:production\",\n            \"owner:[NEW_TEAM_SLUG]:project:[NEW_PROJECT_NAME]:environment:production\"\n          ]\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nYou can validate OpenID Connect tokens by using the issuer's OpenID Connect Discovery Well Known location, which is `https://oidc.vercel.com/.well-known/openid-configuration` for Vercel. There, you can find a property called `jwks_uri` which provides a URI to Vercel's public JSON Web Keys (JWKs). You can use the corresponding JWK identified by `kid` to verify tokens that are signed with the same `kid` in the token's header.\n\n```\n// Header:\n{\n  \"typ\": \"JWT\",\n  \"alg\": \"RS256\",\n  \"kid\": \"example-key-id\"\n}\n// Claims:\n{\n  \"iss\": \"https://vercel.com\",\n  \"aud\": \"https://vercel.com/acme\",\n  \"sub\": \"owner:acme:project:acme_website:environment:production\",\n  \"iat\": 1718885593,\n  \"nfb\": 1718885593,\n  \"exp\": 1718889193,\n  \"owner\": \"acme\",\n  \"owner_id\": \"team_7Gw5ZMzpQA8h90F832KGp7nwbuh3\",\n  \"project\": \"acme_website\",\n  \"project_id\": \"prj_7Gw5ZMBpQA8h9GF832KGp7nwbuh3\",\n  \"environment\": \"production\"\n}\n```\n\nThis is a list of standard tokens that you can expect from an OpenID Connect JWT:\n\n| Claim | Kind | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `iss` | Issuer | The issuer of the token is set to `https://vercel.com` |\n| `aud` | Audience | The audience is set to `https://vercel.com/[TEAM_SLUG]` |\n| `sub` | Subject | The subject is set to `owner:[TEAM_SLUG]:project:[PROJECT_NAME]:environment:[ENVIRONMENT]` |\n| `iat` | Issued at | The time the token was created |\n| `nbf` | Not before | The token is not valid before this time |\n| `exp` | Expires at | The time the token has or will expire. `preview` and `production` tokens expire one hour after creation, `development` tokens expire in 12 hours. |\n\nThese claims provide more granular access control:\n\n| Claim | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `owner` | The team slug, e.g. `acme` |\n| `owner_id` | The team ID, e.g. `team_7Gw5ZMzpQA8h90F832KGp7nwbuh3` |\n| `project` | The project name, e.g. `acme_website` |\n| `project_id` | The project ID, e.g. `prj_7Gw5ZMBpQA8h9GF832KGp7nwbuh3` |\n| `environment` | The environment: `development` or `preview` or `production` |\n\nThese headers are standard to the JWT tokens:\n\n| Header | Kind | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `alg` | Algorithm | The algorithm used by the issuer |\n| `kid` | Key ID | The identifier of the key used to sign the token |\n| `typ` | Type | The type of token, this is set to `jwt`. |",

    "markdown": "# OpenID Connect (OIDC) Federation\n\nWhen you create long-lived, persistent credentials in your backend to allow access from your web applications, you increase the security risk of these credentials being leaked and hacked. You can mitigate this risk with OpenID Connect (OIDC) federation which issues short-lived, non-persistent tokens that are signed by Vercel's OIDC Identity Provider (IdP).\n\nCloud providers such as Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure can trust these tokens and exchange them for short-lived credentials. This way, you can avoid storing long-lived credentials as Vercel environment variables.\n\n*   No persisted credentials: There is no need to copy and paste long-lived access tokens from your cloud provider into your Vercel environment variables. Instead, you can exchange the OIDC token for short-lived access tokens with your trusted cloud provider\n*   Granular access control: You can configure your cloud providers to grant different permissions depending on project or environment. For instance, you can separate your development, preview and production environments on your cloud provider and only grant Vercel issued OIDC tokens access to the necessary environment(s)\n*   Local development access: You can configure your cloud provider to trust local development environments so that long-lived credentials do not need to be stored locally\n\nIn order to allow your deployment to connect with your backend securely, start by enabling OIDC federation for your Vercel project:\n\n*   Open your project from the Vercel dashboard\n*   Select the Settings tab\n*   From the Security section, enable the Secure backend access with OIDC federation toggle\n\nThen, configure your backend to trust Vercel's OIDC Identity Provider and connect to it from your Vercel deployment:\n\nWhen you run a build, Vercel automatically generates a new token and assigns it to the `VERCEL_OIDC_TOKEN` environment variable. You can then exchange the token for short-lived access tokens with your cloud provider.\n\nWhen your application invokes a serverless function, the OIDC token is set to the `x-vercel-oidc-token` header on the function's `Request` object.\n\nVercel does not generate a fresh OIDC token for each execution but caches the token for a maximum of 45 minutes. While the token has a Time to Live (TTL) of 60 minutes, Vercel provides the difference to ensure the token doesn't expire within the lifecycle of a function's maximum execution duration.\n\nYou can download the `VERCEL_OIDC_TOKEN` straight to your local development environment using the CLI command `vercel env pull`.\n\nThis writes the `VERCEL_OIDC_TOKEN` environment variable and other environment variables targeted to `development` to the `.env.local` file of your project folder.

For example, you can set up:\n\n*   Automatic deployments on content changes from a Headless CMS\n*   Scheduled deployments by configuring third-party cron job services to trigger the Deploy Hook\n*   Forced deployments from the command line\n\nTo create a Deploy Hook for your project, make sure your project is [connected to a Git repository](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/overview#git).\n\nOnce your project is connected, navigate to its Settings page and then select the Git menu item.\n\nIn the \"Deploy Hooks\" section, choose a name for your Deploy Hook and select the branch that will be deployed when the generated URL is requested.\n\n![](https://vercel.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.vercel.com%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1689795055%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Fconcepts%2Fdeployments%2Fgit%2Fdeploy-hooks-light.png&w=1920&q=75&dpl=dpl_6RGLzPaeBNhuWHRxN1xTYtAhKUa3)![](https://vercel.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.vercel.com%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1689795055%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Fconcepts%2Fdeployments%2Fgit%2Fdeploy-hooks-dark.png&w=1920&q=75&dpl=dpl_6RGLzPaeBNhuWHRxN1xTYtAhKUa3)\n\nCreating a new Deploy Hook.\n\nWe suggest you use a name that easily identifies the Deploy Hook so you will be able to understand when it triggers a deployment. We also suggest creating only one Deploy Hook per branch unless you’re using multiple data sources.\n\nAfter submitting the form, you will see a URL that you can copy and use.\n\nTo trigger a Deploy Hook, send a GET or POST request to the provided URL.\n\nDeploy Hooks will not be triggered if you have the `github.enabled = false` [configuration](https://vercel.com/docs/project-configuration#git-configuration/github-enabled) present in a `vercel.json` file.\n\nHere's an example request and response you can use for testing:\n\n```\ncurl -X POST https://api.vercel.com/v1/integrations/deploy/prj_98g22o5YUFVHlKOzj9vKPTyN2SDG/tKybBxqhQs\n```\n\n```\n{\n  \"job\": {\n    \"id\": \"okzCd50AIap1O31g0gne\",\n    \"state\": \"PENDING\",\n    \"createdAt\": 1662825789999\n  }\n}\n```\n\nYou do not need to add an authorization header. See [Security](#security) to learn more.\n\nAfter sending a request, you can see that it triggered a deployment on your project dashboard.\n\n![](https://vercel.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.vercel.com%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1689795055%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Fconcepts%2Fdeployments%2Fgit%2Fdeploy-hook-deployed-light.png&w=3840&q=75&dpl=dpl_6RGLzPaeBNhuWHRxN1xTYtAhKUa3)![](https://vercel.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.vercel.com%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1689795055%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Fconcepts%2Fdeployments%2Fgit%2Fdeploy-hook-deployed-dark.png&w=3840&q=75&dpl=dpl_6RGLzPaeBNhuWHRxN1xTYtAhKUa3)\n\nDeployments triggered by a Deploy Hook are marked in the list.\n\nWhen you create a Deploy Hook, a unique identifier is generated in the URL. This allows anyone with the URL to deploy your project, so treat it with the same security as you would any other token or password.\n\nIf you believe your Deploy Hook URL has been compromised, you can revoke it and create a new one.\n\nBuilds triggered by a Deploy Hook are automatically provided with an appropriate [Build Cache](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/troubleshoot-a-build#what-is-cached) by default, if it exists.\n\nCaching helps speed up the [Build Step](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/configure-a-build), so we encourage you to keep the default behaviour. However, if you explicitly want to opt out of using a Build Cache, you can disable it by appending `?buildCache=false` to the Deploy Hook URL.\n\nHere is an example request that explicitly disables the Build Cache:\n\n```\ncurl -X POST https://api.vercel.com/v1/integrations/deploy/prj_98g22o5YUFVHlKOzj9vKPTyN2SDG/tKybBxqhQs?buildCache=false\n```\n\nDeploy Hooks created before May 11th, 2021 do not have the Build Cache enabled by default. To change it, you can either explicitly append `?buildCache=true` to the Deploy Hook URL, or replace your existing Deploy Hook with a newly created one.\n\nIf you send multiple requests to deploy the same version of your project, previous deployments for the same Deploy Hook will be canceled to reduce build times.\n\n*   Hobby and Pro accounts have a limit of 5 deploy hooks per project. Enterprise accounts have a limit of 10 deploy hooks per project.",

Instead, you can use the following commands:\n\n*   [`vercel --prod --skip-domain`](https://vercel.com/docs/cli/deploy#prod): Use to skip custom domain assignment when deploying to production and creating a staged deployment\n*   [`vercel promote [deployment-id or url]`](https://vercel.com/docs/cli/promote): Use to promote your staged deployment to your custom domains\n*   [`vercel rollback [deployment-id or url]`](https://vercel.com/docs/cli/rollback): Use to alias an earlier production deployment to your custom domains\n\nIn general, the command allows for assigning custom domains to any deployment.\n\nMake sure to not include the HTTP protocol (e.g. `https://`) for the `[custom-domain]` parameter.\n\n```\nvercel alias set [deployment-url] [custom-domain]\n```\n\nUsing the `vercel alias` command to assign a custom domain to a deployment.\n\n```\nvercel alias rm [custom-domain]\n```\n\nUsing the `vercel alias` command to remove a custom domain from a deployment.\n\nUsing the `vercel alias` command to list custom domains that were assigned to deployments.\n\nThese are options that only apply to the `vercel alias` command.\n\nThe `--yes` option can be used to bypass the confirmation prompt when removing an alias.\n\n```\nvercel alias rm [custom-domain] --yes\n```\n\nUsing the `vercel alias rm` command with the `--yes` option.\n\nThe `--limit` option can be used to specify the maximum number of aliases returned when using `ls`. The default value is `20` and the maximum is `100`.\n\n```\nvercel alias ls --limit 100\n```\n\nUsing the `vercel alias ls` command with the `--limit` option.\n\nThe following [global options](https://vercel.com/docs/cli/global-options) can be passed when using the `vercel alias` command:\n\nFor more information on global options and their usage, refer to the [options section](https://vercel.com/docs/cli/global-options).",

It will also be the team shown whenever you first log in to Vercel or navigate to `/dashboard`. The first Hobby or Pro team you create will automatically be nominated as the default team.\n\nIf you delete, leave, or are removed from your default team, Vercel will automatically choose a new default team for you. However, you may want to choose a default team yourself. To do that:\n\n1.  Navigate to [vercel.com/account](https://vercel.com/account)\n2.  Under Default Team, select your new default team from the dropdown\n3.  Press Save\n\nYour Team ID is a unique and unchangeable identifier that's automatically assigned when your team is created.\n\nThere are a couple of methods you can use to locate your Team ID:\n\n*   Vercel API: Use the [Vercel API](https://vercel.com/docs/rest-api#endpoints/teams/list-all-teams) to retrieve your Team ID\n*   Dashboard: Find your Team ID directly from your team's Dashboard on Vercel:\n    *   Navigate to the following URL, replacing `your_team_name_here` with your actual team's name: `https://vercel.com/teams/your_team_name_here/settings#team-id`.

Consider this potential impact before enabling Attack Challenge Mode.\n\nWhen you enable Attack Challenge Mode, Vercel will issue every request made to your site with an automatic challenge that's solvable by the end-user's browser. This verifies the visitor is a real person before they can access your site.\n\nTo end-users, this will appear as a page showing the Vercel Security Checkpoint that will only appear on their first visit.

    "markdown": "# Notifications\n\nVercel sends configurable notifications to you through the [dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard) and email. These notifications enable you to view and manage important alerts about your [deployments](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/overview), [domains](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/domains), [integrations](https://vercel.com/docs/integrations), [account](https://vercel.com/docs/accounts), and [usage](https://vercel.com/docs/limits/usage).\n\nThere are a number of places where you can receive notifications:\n\n*   Web: The Vercel dashboard displays a popover, which contains all relevant notifications\n*   Email: You'll receive an email when any of the alerts that you set either on your Hobby account or team have been triggered\n*   SMS: SMS notifications can only be configured on a per-user basis for [Spend Management](https://vercel.com/docs/accounts/spend-management) notifications.\n\nBy default, you will receive both web and email notifications for all [types of alerts](#types-of-notifications). You can [manage these notifications](#managing-notifications) from the Settings tab, but any changes you make will only affect _your_ notifications.\n\nThere are two main ways to interact with web notifications:\n\n*   Read: Unread notifications are displayed with a counter on the bell icon. When you view a notification on the web, it will be marked as read once you close the popover. Because of this, we also will not send an email if you have already read it on the web.\n*   Archive: You can manage the list of notifications by archiving them. You can view these archived notifications in the archive tab, where they will be visible for 365 days.\n\nYou can manage notifications by going to the Settings tab of your account or team's dashboard, and selecting My Notifications. From here, you can toggle [where](#receiving-notifications) _you_ would like to receive notifications for each different [type of notification](#types-of-notifications). Any changes you make will only be reflected for your Hobby account and not for any other members of the team.\n\nYou can receive feedback on your deployments with the Comments feature. When someone leaves a comment, you'll receive a notification on Vercel. You can see all new comments in the Comments tab of your notifications.\n\n[Learn more in the Comments docs](https://vercel.com/docs/workflow-collaboration/comments/managing-comments#notifications).\n\nYou'll receive notifications when you pass base usage [limits](https://vercel.com/docs/limits/overview#included-usage) for products like Serverless Functions, Edge Functions, Edge Middleware, Image Optimization, Remote Cache, and more.\n\nTeam owners on the Pro plan can customize which usage categories they want to receive notifications for based on percentage thresholds or absolute dollar values.\n\nEmails are sent out at specific usage thresholds which varies based on the feature and plan you are on. The below table outlines the thresholds for each:\n\n| Feature | Hobby | Pro | Enterprise |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Spend Management Alerts | \\-  | 50%, 75%, 100% (SMS alerts only at 100%) | \\-  |\n| Monitoring Metric | \\-  | 100%, 4400%, 8800%, 17600%, 26400%, 44400% | \\-  |\n| Bandwidth Usage | 75%, 100% | 75%, 100%, 125%, 200%, 300%, 500%, 1000% | 75%, 100%, 300% |\n| Serverless Function Execution | 75%, 100% | 75%, 100%, 125%, 200%, 300%, 500%, 1000% | 75%, 100%, 300% |\n| Remote Cache Artifacts | 75%, 100% | 75%, 100%, 1000%, 3000% | 75%, 100%, 300% |\n| Edge Middleware Invocations | 75%, 100% | 75%, 100%, 10000%, 20000%, 50000%, 100000% | 75%, 100%, 3000% |\n| Edge Function Execution Units | \\-  | 75%, 100%, 3000%, 5000% | \\-  |\n| Source Image Usage | 75%, 100% | 75%, 100%, 300%, 500%, 1000%, 3000% | 75%, 100%, 300% |\n| Web Analytics Events | 75%, 100% | 75%, 100%, 1500%, 2000%, 3000%, 4000% | 75%, 100% |\n| Edge Config Reads | 75%, 100% | 75%, 100%, 300% | 75%, 100%, 300% |\n| Edge Config Writes | 75%, 100% | 75%, 100%, 300% | 75%, 100%, 300% |\n\nIf you choose to disable notifications, you won't receive alerts for any excessive charges within that category. This may result in unexpected additional costs on your bill. It is recommended that you carefully consider the implications of turning off notifications for any usage thresholds before making changes to your notification settings.\n\nThe types of notifications available for you to manage depend on the [role](https://vercel.com/docs/accounts/team-members-and-roles/access-roles/team-level-roles) you are assigned within your team. For example, someone with a [Developer](https://vercel.com/docs/accounts/team-members-and-roles/access-roles#developer-role) role will only be able to be notified of Deployment failures and Integration updates.\n\nIt is _not_ possible to disable all notifications for alerts that are critical to your Vercel workflow. You can opt-out of [one specific channel](#receiving-notifications), like email, but not both email and web notifications. This is because of the importance of these notifications for using the Vercel platform. The list below provides information on which alerts are critical.\n\n| Notification group | Type of notification | Explanation | [Critical notification?](#critical-notifications) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Account |     |     |     |\n|     | Team join requests | Team owners will be notified when someone requests access to join their team and can follow a link from the notification to manage the request. |     |\n| Deployment |     |     |     |\n|     | Deployment Failures | Deployment owners will be notified about any deployment failures that occur for any Project on your account or team. |     |\n| Domain |     |     |     |\n|     | Configuration - Certificate renewal failed | Team owners will be notified if the SSL Certification renewal for any of their team's domains has failed. For more information, see [When is the SSL Certificate on my Vercel Domain renewed?](https://vercel.com/guides/renewal-of-ssl-certificates-with-a-vercel-domain). |     |\n|     | Configuration - Domain Configured | Team owners will be notified of any domains that have been added to a project. For more information, see [Add a domain](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/domains/add-a-domain). |     |\n|     | Configuration - Domain Misconfigured | Team owners will be notified of any domains that have been added to a project and are misconfigured.

    "markdown": "# Spend Management\n\nSpend management is a way for you to notify or to automatically take action on your account when your team hits a [set spend amount](#what-does-spend-management-include). The actions you can take are:\n\nSetting a spend amount does not automatically stop usage. If you want to pause all your projects at a certain amount, you must [enable the option](#pausing-projects).\n\nThe spend amount is set per billing cycle.\n\nSetting the amount halfway through a billing cycle considers your current spend. You can increase or decrease your spend amount as needed. If you configure it below the current monthly spend, Spend Management will trigger any configured actions (including pausing all projects).\n\nThe spend amount that you set covers [metered resources](https://vercel.com/docs/limits/overview#additional-resources) that go beyond your Pro plan [usage](https://vercel.com/docs/limits/overview#included-usage) for all projects on your team.\n\nIt does not include seats or separate [add-ons](https://vercel.com/docs/accounts/plans/pro#pro-plan-add-ons), which Vercel charges on a monthly basis.\n\nVercel checks your metered resource usage often to determine if you are approaching or have exceeded your spend amount. This check happens every few minutes.\n\n1.  To enable spend management, you must have an [Owner](https://vercel.com/docs/accounts/team-members-and-roles/access-roles#owner-role) or [Billing](https://vercel.com/docs/accounts/team-members-and-roles/access-roles#billing-role) role on your [Pro](https://vercel.com/docs/accounts/plans/pro) team\n2.  From your team's [dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard), select the Settings tab\n3.  Select Billing from the list\n4.  Under Spend Management, toggle the switch to enabled:\n    \n    ![Spend Management section with toggle enabled.](https://vercel.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.vercel.com%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1696341951%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Fconcepts%2Fteams%2Fspend-manage-light.png&w=1920&q=75&dpl=dpl_6RGLzPaeBNhuWHRxN1xTYtAhKUa3)![Spend Management section with toggle enabled.](https://vercel.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.vercel.com%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1696341951%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Fconcepts%2Fteams%2Fspend-manage-dark.png&w=1920&q=75&dpl=dpl_6RGLzPaeBNhuWHRxN1xTYtAhKUa3)\n    \n    Spend Management section with toggle enabled.\n    \n5.  Set the amount in USD at which you would like to receive a notification or trigger an action\n6.  Select the action(s) to happen when your spend amount is reached: [pause all your projects](#pausing-projects), [send notifications](#managing-alert-threshold-notifications), or [trigger a webhook URL](#configuring-a-webhook)\n\nWhen you set a spend amount, Vercel automatically enables web and email notifications for your team. These get triggered when spending on your team reaches 50%, 75%, and 100% of the spend amount. You can also receive [SMS notifications](https://vercel.com/docs/accounts/spend-management#sms-notifications) when your team reaches 100% of the spend amount. To manage your notifications:\n\n1.  You must have an [Owner](https://vercel.com/docs/accounts/team-members-and-roles/access-roles#owner-role) or [Billing](https://vercel.com/docs/accounts/team-members-and-roles/access-roles#billing-role) role on your [Pro](https://vercel.com/docs/accounts/plans/pro) team\n2.  From your team's [dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard), select the Settings tab\n3.  Select My Notifications from the list\n4.  Under Team, ensure that Spend Management is selected\n5.  Select the icon and select the thresholds for which you would like to receive web and email notification, as described in [Notifications](https://vercel.com/docs/dashboard-features/notifications)\n6.  Repeat the previous step for the Web, Email, and SMS notification sections\n\nFollowing these steps only configures **your** notifications. Team members with the Owner or Billing role can configure their own preferences\n\nIn addition to web and email notifications, you can enable SMS notifications for Spend Management. They are only triggered when you reach 100% of your spend amount.\n\nTo enable SMS notifications:\n\n1.  You must have an [Owner](https://vercel.com/docs/accounts/team-members-and-roles/access-roles#owner-role) or [Billing](https://vercel.com/docs/accounts/team-members-and-roles/access-roles#billing-role) role on your [Pro](https://vercel.com/docs/accounts/plans/pro) team. Note that following these steps only configures your SMS notifications. Each member with an Owner or Billing role can configure their own SMS notifications for Spend Management\n2.  Set your [spend amount](#managing-your-spend-amount)\n3.  From your team's [dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard), select the Settings tab\n4.  Select My Notifications from the list, scroll to SMS at the bottom of the page and toggle the switch to Enabled. If your personal profile has a phone number associated with it, SMS notifications will be enabled by default\n5.  Under Team, ensure that Spend Management is selected\n6.  Enter your phone number and follow the steps to verify it\n\nVercel provides an option to automatically pause the production deployment for all of your projects when your spend amount is reached. This option is on by default.\n\n1.  In the Spend Management section of your team's settings, enable and set your [spend amount](#managing-your-spend-amount)\n2.  Ensure the Pause production deployment switch is Enabled\n3.  Confirm the action by entering the team name and select Continue. Your changes save automatically\n4.  When your team reaches the spend amount, Vercel automatically pauses the production deployment for all projects on your team\n\nWhen visitors access your production deployment while it is paused, they will see a [503 DEPLOYMENT\\_PAUSED error](https://vercel.com/docs/errors/DEPLOYMENT_PAUSED).\n\nProjects need to be resumed on an individual basis, either [through the dashboard](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/overview#resuming-a-project) or the [Vercel REST API](https://vercel.com/docs/rest-api/endpoints/projects#unpause-a-project).\n\nProjects won't automatically unpause if you increase the spend amount, you must resume each project manually.\n\nYou can configure a webhook URL to trigger events such as serving a static version of your site, [pausing a project](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/overview#pausing-a-project), or sending a Slack notification.\n\nVercel will send a [HTTPS POST request](#webhook-payload) to the URL that you provide when the following events happen:\n\n*   [When a spend amount reaches 100%](#spend-amount)\n*   [At the end of your billing cycle](#end-of-billing-cycle)\n\nTo configure a webhook for spend management:\n\n1.  In the Spend Management section of your team's settings, set your [spend amount](#managing-your-spend-amount)\n2.  Enter the webhook URL for the endpoint that will receive a POST request. In order to be accessible, make sure your endpoints are public\n3.  Secure your webhooks by comparing the [`x-vercel-signature`](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/headers#x-vercel-signature) request header to the SHA that is generated when you save your webhook. To learn more, see the [securing webhooks](https://vercel.com/docs/observability/webhooks-overview/webhooks-api#securing-webhooks) documentation\n\nThe webhook URL receives an HTTP POST request with the following JSON payload for each event:\n\nSent when the team hits 100% of their spend amount.\n\n| Parameters | Type | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `budgetAmount` | int | The [spend amount](https://vercel.com/docs/accounts/spend-management#managing-your-spend-amount) that you have set |\n| `currentSpend` | int | The [total cost](https://vercel.com/docs/accounts/spend-management#managing-your-spend-amount) that your team [has accrued](https://vercel.com/docs/accounts/spend-management#what-does-spend-management-include) during the current billing cycle. |\n| `teamId` | string | Your Vercel Team ID |\n\n```\n{\n  \"budgetAmount\": 500,\n  \"currentSpend\": 500,\n  \"teamId\": \"team_jkT8yZ3oE1u6xLo8h6dxfNc3\"\n}\n```\n\nSent when the billing cycle ends. You can use this event to resume paused projects.\n\n| Parameters | Type | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `teamId` | string | Your Vercel Team ID |\n| `type` | string | The type of event |\n\n```\n{\n  \"teamId\": \"team_jkT8yZ3oE1u6xLo8h6dxfNc3\",\n  \"type\": \"endOfBillingCycle\"\n}\n```\n\nVercel displays all spend management activity in the Activity tab of your [team's dashboard](https://vercel.com/docs/observability/activity-log). This includes spend amount creation and updates, and project pausing and unpausing.\n\nFor more information on Vercel's pricing, guidance on optimizing consumption, and invoices, see the following resources:",

You also have the ability to re-order the precedence of each custom rule.\n\nWhen a rule denies or challenges the traffic to your site and the client has not previously solved the challenge (in the case of challenge mode), the rule execution stops and blocks the request.\n\nAfter a Log rule runs, the rule execution continues. If no other rule matches and blocks the request, the Log rule that is last matched is reported.\n\nTo ensure your Custom Rule behaves as intended:\n\n1.

    "markdown": "# vercel deploy\n\nThe `vercel deploy` command deploys Vercel projects, executable from the project's root directory or by specifying a path. You can omit 'deploy' in `vercel deploy`, as `vercel` is the only command that operates without a subcommand. This document will use 'vercel' to refer to `vercel deploy`.\n\nUsing the `vercel` command from the root of a Vercel project directory.\n\n```\nvercel --cwd [path-to-project]\n```\n\nUsing the `vercel` command and supplying a path to the root directory of the Vercel project.\n\nUsing the `vercel` command to deploy a prebuilt Vercel project, typically with `vercel build`. See [vercel build](https://vercel.com/docs/cli/build) and [Build Output API](https://vercel.com/docs/build-output-api/v3) for more details.\n\nWhen deploying, `stdout` is always the Deployment URL.\n\n```\nvercel > deployment-url.txt\n```\n\nUsing the `vercel` command to deploy and write `stdout` to a text file. When deploying, `stdout` is always the Deployment URL.\n\nIn the following example, you create a bash script that you include in your CI/CD workflow. The goal is to have all preview deployments be aliased to a custom domain so that developers can bookmark the preview deployment URL. Note that you may need to [define the scope](https://vercel.com/docs/cli/global-options#scope) when using `vercel alias`\n\n```\n# save stdout and stderr to files\nvercel deploy >deployment-url.txt 2>error.txt\n \n# check the exit code\ncode=$?\nif [ $code -eq 0 ]; then\n    # Now you can use the deployment url from stdout for the next step of your workflow\n    deploymentUrl=`cat deployment-url.txt`\n    vercel alias $deploymentUrl my-custom-domain.com\nelse\n    # Handle the error\n    errorMessage=`cat error.txt`\n    echo \"There was an error: $errorMessage\"\nfi\n```\n\nThe script deploys your project and assigns the deployment URL saved in `stdout` to the custom domain using `vercel alias`.\n\nIf you need to check for errors when the command is executed such as in a CI/CD workflow, use `stderr`. If the exit code is anything other than `0`, an error has occurred. The following example demonstrates a script that checks if the exit code is not equal to 0:\n\n```\n# save stdout and stderr to files\nvercel deploy >deployment-url.txt 2>error.txt\n \n# check the exit code\ncode=$?\nif [ $code -eq 0 ]; then\n    # Now you can use the deployment url from stdout for the next step of your workflow\n    deploymentUrl=`cat deployment-url.txt`\n    echo $deploymentUrl\nelse\n    # Handle the error\n    errorMessage=`cat error.txt`\n    echo \"There was an error: $errorMessage\"\nfi\n```\n\nThese are options that only apply to the `vercel` command.\n\nThe `--build-env` option, shorthand `-b`, can be used to provide environment variables to the [build step](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/configure-a-build).\n\n```\nvercel --build-env KEY1=value1 --build-env KEY2=value2\n```\n\nUsing the `vercel` command with the `--build-env` option.\n\nThe `--yes` option can be used to skip questions you are asked when setting up a new Vercel project. The questions will be answered with the provided defaults, inferred from `vercel.json` and the folder name.\n\nUsing the `vercel` command with the `--yes` option.\n\nThe `--env` option, shorthand `-e`, can be used to provide [environment variables](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables) at runtime.\n\n```\nvercel --env KEY1=value1 --env KEY2=value2\n```\n\nUsing the `vercel` command with the `--env` option.\n\nThe `--name` option has been deprecated in favor of [Vercel project linking](https://vercel.com/docs/cli/project-linking), which allows you to link a Vercel project to your local codebase when you run `vercel`.\n\nThe `--name` option, shorthand `-n`, can be used to provide a Vercel project name for a deployment.\n\nUsing the `vercel` command with the `--name` option.\n\nThe `--prod` option can be used to create a deployment for a production domain specified in the Vercel project dashboard.\n\nUsing the `vercel` command with the `--prod` option.\n\nMust be used with [`--prod`](#prod). The `--skip-domain` option will disable the automatic promotion (aliasing) of the relevant domains to a new production deployment. You can use [`vercel promote`](https://vercel.com/docs/cli/promote) to complete the domain-assignment process later.\n\n```\nvercel --prod --skip-domain\n```\n\nUsing the `vercel` command with the `--skip-domain` option.\n\nThe `--public` option can be used to ensures the source code is publicly available at the `/_src` path.\n\nUsing the `vercel` command with the `--public` option.\n\nThe `--regions` option can be used to specify which [regions](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/regions) the deployments [Serverless Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/serverless-functions) should run in.\n\nUsing the `vercel` command with the `--regions` option.\n\nThe `--no-wait` option does not wait for a deployment to finish before exiting from the `deploy` command.\n\nThe `--force` option, shorthand `-f`, is used to force a new deployment without the [build cache](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/troubleshoot-a-build#what-is-cached).\n\nThe `--with-cache` option is used to retain the [build cache](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/troubleshoot-a-build#what-is-cached) when using `--force`.\n\n```\nvercel --force --with-cache\n```\n\nThe `--archive` option compresses the deployment code into a single file before uploading it. The only currently supported format is \"tgz\".\n\n```\nvercel deploy --archive=tgz\n```\n\nThe following [global options](https://vercel.com/docs/cli/global-options) can be passed when using the `vercel deploy` command:\n\nFor more information on global options and their usage, refer to the [options section](https://vercel.com/docs/cli/global-options).",

    "markdown": "# vercel bisect\n\nThe `vercel bisect` command can be used to perform a [binary search](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm) upon a set of deployments in a Vercel Project for the purpose of determining when a bug was introduced.\n\nThis is similar to [git bisect](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-bisect) but faster because you don't need to wait to rebuild each commit, as long as there is a corresponding Deployment. The command works by specifing both a _bad_ Deployment and a _good_ Deployment. Then, `vercel bisect` will retrieve all the deployments in between, and step by them one by one. At each step, you will perform your check and specify whether or not the issue you are investigating is present in the Deployment for that step.\n\nNote that if an alias URL is used for either the _good_ or _bad_ deployment, then the URL will be resolved to the current target of the alias URL. So if your Project is currently in promote/rollback state, then the alias URL may not be the newest chronological Deployment.\n\nThe good and bad deployments provided to `vercel bisect` must be production deployments.\n\nUsing the `vercel bisect` command will initiate an interactive prompt where you specify a good deployment, followed by a bad deployment and step through the deployments in between to find the first bad deployment.\n\nThese are options that only apply to the `vercel bisect` command.\n\nThe `--good` option, shorthand `-g`, can be used to specify the initial \"good\" deployment from the command line. When this option is present, the prompt will be skipped at the beginning of the bisect session. A production alias URL may be specified for convenience.\n\n```\nvercel bisect --good https://example.com\n```\n\nUsing the `vercel bisect` command with the `--good` option.\n\nThe `--bad` option, shorthand `-b`, can be used to specify the \"bad\" deployment from the command line. When this option is present, the prompt will be skipped at the beginning of the bisect session. A production alias URL may be specified for convenience.\n\n```\nvercel bisect --bad https://example-s93n1nfa.vercel.app\n```\n\nUsing the `vercel bisect` command with the `--bad` option.\n\nThe `--path` option, shorthand `-p`, can be used to specify a subpath of the deployment where the issue occurs. The subpath will be appended to each URL during the bisect session.\n\n```\nvercel bisect --path /blog/first-post\n```\n\nUsing the `vercel bisect` command with the `--path` option.\n\nThe `--open` option, shorthand `-o`, will attempt to automatically open each deployment URL in your browser window for convenience.\n\nUsing the `vercel bisect` command with the `--open` option.\n\nThe `--run` option, shorthand `-r`, provides the ability for the bisect session to be automated using a shell script or command that will be invoked for each deployment URL. The shell script can run an automated test (for example, using the `curl` command to check the exit code) which the bisect command will use to determine whether each URL is good (exit code 0), bad (exit code non-0), or should be skipped (exit code 125).\n\n```\nvercel bisect --run ./test.sh\n```\n\nUsing the `vercel bisect` command with the `--run` option.\n\nThe following [global options](https://vercel.com/docs/cli/global-options) can be passed when using the `vercel bisect` command:\n\nFor more information on global options and their usage, refer to the [options section](https://vercel.com/docs/cli/global-options).",

TLS fingerprints allow the unique identification of user sessions inspecting details in the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol initiation process.\n\nTLS fingerprinting is a process used to identify and categorize encrypted network traffic.\n\nIt creates a unique identifier from the details of a [TLS client hello packet](https://serializethoughts.com/2014/07/27/dissecting-tls-client-hello-message), such as the version of TLS, supported cipher suites, and included extensions.\n\n*   TLS fingerprints allow the unique identification of user session\n*   JA3 and JA4 transform the TLS handshake details into a hash\n*   The hash is used as a fingerprint to monitor and restrict access\n*   The hash can then be read from your Functions through the request headers\n\nControlling access by TLS fingerprint allows us to mitigate malicious actors that use sophisticated methods of attack. For example, a DDoS attack that is spread across multiple user agents, IPs, or geographic locations might share the same TLS fingerprint. With fingerprinting, the Vercel Firewall can block all of the traffic that matches that TLS fingerprint.\n\nJA4 is part of the [JA4+ suite](https://github.com/FoxIO-LLC/ja4?tab=readme-ov-file#ja4-details). It offers a more granular and flexible approach to network fingerprinting, helping to mitigate malicious traffic and prevent bot traffic.\n\nWith JA4, it's possible to identify, track, and categorize server-side encrypted network traffic. This is crucial in detecting and mitigating potential security threats, as it provides a more comprehensive view of the network traffic when used in conjunction with other fields.\n\nJA3 is a tool that uses TLS fingerprinting to track and identify potential security threats. It specifically focuses on the details of the TLS client hello packet, generating a unique hash from it. This [client hello packet](https://serializethoughts.com/2014/07/27/dissecting-tls-client-hello-message) contains specific information such as the TLS version, supported cipher suites, and any extensions used.\n\nIn the Default web traffic view of the [Vercel WAF monitoring page](https://vercel.com/docs/security/vercel-waf#traffic-monitoring), you can group the web traffic by JA4 Digest to review the fingerprints of the live traffic or the past 24 hours.\n\nThe following headers are sent to each deployment and can be used to process the [request](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request) before sending back a response.

With Vercel's automatic deployments, this won't require any extra effort. By default, when your Vercel project is connected to a Git repository, Vercel will deploy every commit that is pushed to the Git repository, regardless of which branch you're pushing it to.\n\nA Production environment is one built from the `main` or development branch of your Git repository. A preview environment is created when you deploy from any other branch.\n\nVercel provides a [URL](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/generated-urls#url-with-git-branch) that reflects the latest pushes to that branch. You can find this either on your dashboard, or in a pull request, which you'll see in the next step\n\nThis connection was established for you automatically, so all you have to do is push commits, and you will start receiving links to deployments right on your Git provider.\n\n1.

    "markdown": "# Technical Guidelines for Migration to Vercel\n\nWhen your application is hosted across multiple servers, maintaining [session](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Session) information consistency can be challenging.\n\nFor example, if your legacy application is served on a different domain than your new application, the HTTP session cookies will not be shared between the two. If the data that you need to share is not easily calculable and derivable, you will need a central session store as in the use cases below:\n\n*   Using cookies for storing user specific data such as last login time and recent viewed items\n*   Using cookies for tracking the number of items added to the cart\n\nIf you are not currently using a central session store for persisting sessions or are considering moving to one, you can use [Vercel KV](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-kv).\n\nLearn more about creating a session store and managing session data with [Edge Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/edge-functions) in our [quickstart guide](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-kv/quickstart).\n\nBy [pointing your domain to Vercel at the start of migration](https://vercel.com/docs/incremental-migration/migration-guide#point-your-domain-to-vercel), all your traffic gets directed to Vercel, affecting your [bandwidth usage](https://vercel.com/docs/limits/usage#bandwidth). Be sure to account for potential additional costs associated with this approach.\n\nThe [Usage](https://vercel.com/docs/limits/usage) tab on your [dashboard](https://vercel.com/docs/dashboard-features) can assist in monitoring your bandwidth usage.\n\nMinimize risk and perform A/B testing by combining your migration by feature with a user group strategy. You can use [Edge Config](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/edge-config) to store user group information and [Edge Middleware](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/edge-middleware) to direct traffic appropriately.\n\n*   Review our [Edge Config feature flag template](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/feature-flag-apple-store) for a deeper understanding of this approach\n*   You can also consult our [guide on A/B Testing on Vercel](https://vercel.com/guides/ab-testing-on-vercel) for implementing this strategy\n\nConsider using [Serverless Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/serverless-functions) or [Edge Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/edge-functions) as you migrate your application.\n\nThis allows for the implementation of small, specific, and independent functionality units triggered by events, potentially enhancing future performance and reducing the risk of breaking changes. However, it may require refactoring your existing code to be more modular and reusable.\n\nPrevent the loss of indexed pages, links, and duplicate content when creating rewrites to direct part of your traffic to the new Vercel deployment. Consider the following:\n\n*   Write E2E tests to ensure correct setting of canonical tags and robot indexing at each migration step\n*   Account for existing redirects and rewrites on your legacy server, ensuring they are thoroughly tested during migration\n*   Maintain the same routes for migrated feature(s) on Vercel",

    "markdown": "# Incremental Migration Guide\n\nFollow these steps to [incrementally migrate](https://vercel.com/docs/incremental-migration) your website to Vercel. Two possible strategies can be applied:\n\n1.  [Point your domain to Vercel from the beginning](#point-your-domain-to-vercel)\n2.  [Keep your domain on the legacy server](#keep-your-domain-on-the-legacy-server)\n\nIt's advisable to peruse the [troubleshooting section](#troubleshooting) before initiating the migration process.\n\nIn this approach, you make Vercel [the entry point for all your production traffic](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/domains/add-a-domain). When you begin, all traffic will be sent to the legacy server with [rewrites](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/rewrites) and/or fallbacks. As you migrate different aspects of your site to Vercel, you can remove the rewrites/fallbacks to the migrated paths so that they are now served by Vercel.\n\n![](https://vercel.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.vercel.com%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1689795055%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Fincremental-migration%2Fapproach-1-light.png&w=3840&q=75&dpl=dpl_6RGLzPaeBNhuWHRxN1xTYtAhKUa3)![](https://vercel.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.vercel.com%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1689795055%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Fincremental-migration%2Fapproach-1-dark.png&w=3840&q=75&dpl=dpl_6RGLzPaeBNhuWHRxN1xTYtAhKUa3)\n\nPoint your domain to Vercel approach\n\nUse the [framework](https://vercel.com/docs/frameworks) of your choice to deploy your application to Vercel\n\nSend all traffic to the legacy server using one of the following 3 methods:\n\nUse rewrites [built-in to the framework](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/rewrites#using-rewrites-with-supported-frameworks) such as configuring `next.config.js` with [fallbacks and rewrites in Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/rewrites)\n\nThe code example below shows how to configure rewrites with fallback using `next.config.js` to send all traffic to the legacy server:\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  async rewrites() {\n    return {\n      fallback: [\n        {\n          source: '/:path*',\n          destination: 'https://my-legacy-site.com/:path*',\n        },\n      ],\n    };\n  },\n};\n```\n\nUse `vercel.json` for frameworks that do not have rewrite support. See the [how do rewrites work](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/rewrites#how-do-rewrites-work) documentation to learn how to rewrite to an external destination, from a specific path.\n\nUse [Edge Config](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/edge-config) with [Edge Middleware](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/edge-middleware) to rewrite requests at the edge with the following benefits:\n\n*   No need to re-deploy your application when rewrite changes are required\n*   Immediately switch back to the legacy server if the new feature implementation is broken\n\nReview this [maintenance page example](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/maintenance-page) to understand the mechanics of this approach\n\nThis is an example middleware code for executing the rewrites at the edge:\n\n```\nimport { get } from '@vercel/edge-config';\nimport { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server';\n \nexport const config = {\n  matcher: '/((?!api|_next/static|favicon.ico).*)',\n};\n \nexport default async function middleware(request: NextRequest) {\n  const url = request.nextUrl;\n  const rewrites = await get('rewrites'); // Get rewrites stored in Edge Config\n \n  for (const rewrite of rewrites) {\n    if (rewrite.source === url.pathname) {\n      url.pathname = rewrite.destination;\n      return NextResponse.rewrite(url);\n    }\n  }\n \n  return NextResponse.next();\n}\n```\n\nIn the above example, you use Edge Config to store one key-value pair for each rewrite. In this case, you should consider [Edge Config Limits](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/edge-config/edge-config-limits) (For example, 5000 routes would require around 512KB of storage). You can also rewrite based on [URLPatterns](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/URLPattern) where you would store each URLPattern as a key-value pair in Edge Config and not require one pair for each route.\n\nConnect your [production domain](https://vercel.com/docs/getting-started-with-vercel/domains) to your Vercel Project. All your traffic will now be sent to the legacy server.\n\nDevelop and test the first iteration of your application on Vercel on specific paths.\n\nWith the fallback approach such as with the `next.config.js` example above, Next.js will automatically serve content from your Vercel project as you add new paths to your application. You will therefore not need to make any rewrite configuration changes as you iterate. For specific rewrite rules, you will need to remove/update them as you iterate.\n\nRepeat this process until all the paths are migrated to Vercel and all rewrites are removed.\n\nIn this approach, once you have tested a specific feature on your new Vercel application, you configure your legacy server or proxy to send the traffic on that path to the path on the Vercel deployment where the feature is deployed.\n\n![](https://vercel.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.vercel.com%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1689795055%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Fincremental-migration%2Fapproach-2-light.png&w=3840&q=75&dpl=dpl_6RGLzPaeBNhuWHRxN1xTYtAhKUa3)![](https://vercel.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.vercel.com%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1689795055%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Fincremental-migration%2Fapproach-2-dark.png&w=3840&q=75&dpl=dpl_6RGLzPaeBNhuWHRxN1xTYtAhKUa3)\n\nKeep your domain on the legacy server approach\n\nUse the [framework](https://vercel.com/docs/frameworks) of your choice to deploy your application on Vercel and build the first feature that you would like to migrate.\n\nOnce you have tested the first feature fully on Vercel, add a rewrite or reverse proxy to your existing server to send the traffic on the path for that feature to the Vercel deployment.\n\nFor example, if you are using [nginx](https://nginx.org/), you can use the [`proxy_pass`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_proxy_module.html#proxy_pass) directive to send the traffic to the Vercel deployment.\n\nLet's say you deployed the new feature at the folder `new-feature` of the new Next.js application and set its [`basePath`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/basePath) to `/new-feature`, as shown below:\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  basePath: '/new-feature',\n};\n```\n\nWhen deployed, your new feature will be available at `https://my-new-app.vercel.app/`.\n\nYou can then use the following nginx configuration to send the traffic for that feature from the legacy server to the new implementation:\n\n```\nserver {\n    listen 80;\n    server_name legacy-server.com www.legacy-server.com;\n \n    location /feature-path-on-legacy-server {\n        proxy_pass https://my-new-app.vercel.app/;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nRepeat steps 1 and 2 until all the features have been migrated to Vercel. You can then point your domain to Vercel and remove the legacy server.\n\nVercel has a limit of 1024 routes per deployment for rewrites. If you have more than 1024 routes, you may want to consider creating a custom solution using Middleware. For more information on how to do this in Next.js, see [Managing redirects at scale](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/redirecting#managing-redirects-at-scale-advanced).\n\nIf you're facing unexpected outcomes or cannot find an immediate solution for an unexpected behaviour with a new feature, you can set up a variable in [Edge Config](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/edge-config) that you can turn on and off at any time without having to make any code changes on your deployment. The value of this variable will determine whether you rewrite to the new version or the legacy server.\n\nFor example, with Next.js, you can use the follow [middleware](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/edge-middleware) code example:\n\n```\nimport { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server';\nimport { get } from '@vercel/edge-config';\n \nexport const config = {\n  matcher: ['/'], // URL to match\n};\n \nexport async function middleware(request: NextRequest) {\n  try {\n    // Check whether the new version should be shown - isNewVersionActive is a boolean value stored in Edge Config that you can update from your Project dashboard without any code changes\n    const isNewVersionActive = await get<boolean>('isNewVersionActive');\n \n    // If `isNewVersionActive` is false, rewrite to the legacy server URL\n    if (!isNewVersionActive) {\n      req.nextUrl.pathname = `/legacy-path`;\n      return NextResponse.rewrite(req.nextUrl);\n    }\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error(error);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n[Create an Edge Config](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/edge-config/edge-config-dashboard#create-an-edge-config) and set it to `{ \"isNewVersionActive\": true }`. By default, the new feature is active since `isNewVersionActive` is `true`. If you experience any issues, you can fallback to the legacy server by setting `isNewVersionActive` to `false` in the Edge Config from your Vercel dashboard.",

    "markdown": "# Building Integrations with Vercel REST API\n\nSee the following API reference documentation for how to use Vercel REST API to create integrations:\n\nTo use Vercel REST API, you need to authenticate with an [access token](https://vercel.com/docs/rest-api#introduction/api-basics/authentication) that contains the necessary [scope](#scopes). You can then provide the API token through the [`Authorization` header](https://vercel.com/docs/rest-api#authentication).\n\nWhen you create an integration, you define a [redirect URL](https://vercel.com/docs/integrations/create-integration#redirect-url) that can have query parameters attached.\n\nOne of these parameters is the `code` parameter. This short-lived parameter is valid for 30 minutes and can be exchanged once for a long-lived access token using the following API endpoint:\n\n```\n{`POST https://api.vercel.com/v2/oauth/access_token`}\n```\n\nPass the following values to the request body in the form of `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.\n\n| Key | [Type](#api-basics/types) | Required | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| client\\_id | [ID](#api-basics/types) | Yes | ID of your application. |\n| client\\_secret | [String](#api-basics/types) | Yes | Secret of your application. |\n| code | [String](#api-basics/types) | Yes | The code you received. |\n| redirect\\_uri | [String](#api-basics/types) | Yes | The Redirect URL you configured on the Integration Console. |\n\nThe response of your `code` exchange request includes a `team_id` property. If `team_id` is not null, you know that this integration was installed on a team.\n\nIf your integration is installed on a team, append the `teamId` query parameter to each API request. See [Accessing Resources Owned by a Team](https://vercel.com/docs/rest-api#accessing-resources-owned-by-a-team) for more details.\n\nEach installation of your integration is stored and tracked as a configuration.\n\nSometimes it makes sense to fetch the configuration in order to get more insights about the current scope or the projects your integration has access to.\n\nTo see which endpoints are available, see the [Configurations](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/project-configuration) documentation for more details.\n\nIf an owner(s) of an integration leaves the team that's responsible for the integration, the integration will be flagged as disabled. The team will receive an email to take action (transfer ownership) within 30 days, otherwise the integration will be deleted.\n\nWhen integration configurations are disabled:\n\n*   Any API requests will fail with a `403` HTTP status code and a `code` of `integration_configuration_disabled`\n*   We continue to send `project.created`, `project.removed` and `integration-configuration.removed` webhooks, as these will allow the integration configuration to operate correctly when re-activated. All other webhook delivery will be paused\n*   Log drains will not receive any logs\n\nDeployments made with Vercel are grouped into Projects. This means that each deployment is assigned a name and is grouped into a project with other deployments using that same name.\n\nUsing the Vercel REST API, you can modify Projects that the Integration has access to. Here are some examples:\n\nWhen building a Vercel Integration, you may want to expose an API token or a configuration URL for deployments within a [Project](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/overview).\n\nYou can do so by [Creating a Project Environment Variable](https://vercel.com/docs/rest-api/endpoints#create-one-or-more-environment-variables) using the API.\n\nWhen creating integrations the following scopes can be updated within the Integration Console:\n\nWrite permissions are required for both `project` and `domain` when updating the domain of a project.\n\n| Scope | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| integration-configuration | Interact with the installation of your integration |\n| deployment | Interact with deployments |\n| deployment-check | Verify deployments with Checks |\n| edge-config | Create and manage Edge Configs and their tokens |\n| project | Access project details and settings |\n| project-env-vars | Create and manage integration-owned project environment variables |\n| global-project-env-vars | Create and manage all account project environment variables |\n| team | Access team details |\n| user | Get information about the current user |\n| log-drain | Create and manage log drains to forward logs |\n| domain | Manage and interact with domains and certificates. Write permissions are required for both `project` and `domain` when updating the domain of a project. |\n\nInteract with an installation of your integration.\n\nInteract with deployments.\n\nVerify deployments with Checks.\n\nCreate and manage Edge Configs and their tokens.\n\nAccess project details and settings.\n\nCreate and manage integration-owned project environment variables.\n\nCreate and manage all account project environment variables.\n\nGet information about the current user.\n\nCreate and manage log drains to forward logs.\n\nManage and interact with domains and certificates.\n\nAs the Vercel REST API evolves, you'll need to update your scopes based on your integration's endpoint usage.\n\n![Confirming Scope changes.](https://vercel.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.vercel.com%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1687479153%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Fintegrations%2Fconsole%2Fconfirm-scope-change.png&w=3840&q=75&dpl=dpl_6RGLzPaeBNhuWHRxN1xTYtAhKUa3)![Confirming Scope changes.](https://vercel.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.vercel.com%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1687479153%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Fintegrations%2Fconsole%2Fconfirm-scope-change-dark.png&w=3840&q=75&dpl=dpl_6RGLzPaeBNhuWHRxN1xTYtAhKUa3)\n\nConfirming Scope changes.\n\nAdditions and upgrades always require a review and confirmation. To ensure this, every affected user and team owner will be informed through email to undergo this process. Please make sure you provide a meaningful, short, and descriptive note for your changes.\n\nScope removals and downgrades won't require user confirmation and will be applied immediately to confirmed scopes and pending requested scope changes.\n\nUser and Teams will always confirm all pending changes with one confirmation. That means that if you have requested new scopes multiple times over the past year, the users will see a summary of all pending changes with their respective provided note.\n\nOnce a user confirms these changes, scopes get directly applied to the installation. You will also get notified through the new `integration-configuration.scope-change-confirmed` event.\n\nWhen using the Vercel REST API with Integrations, you might come across some errors which you can address immediately.\n\nTo avoid CORS issues, make sure you only interact with the Vercel REST API on the server side.\n\nSince the token grants access to resources of the Team or Personal Account, you should never expose it on the client side.\n\nFor more information on using CORS with Vercel, see [How can I enable CORS on Vercel?](https://vercel.com/guides/how-to-enable-cors).\n\nEnsure you are not missing the `teamId` [query parameter](https://vercel.com/docs/integrations/create-integration#redirect-url). `teamId` is required if the integration installation is for a Team. Ensure the Scope of Your [Access Token](https://vercel.com/docs/rest-api/vercel-api-integrations#using-the-vercel-api/scopes/teams) is properly set.",

    "markdown": "# Headers Included with Deployments\n\nHeaders are small pieces of information that are sent between the client (usually a web browser) and the server. They contain metadata about the request and response, such as the content type, cache-control directives, and authentication tokens. [HTTP headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers) can be found in both the HTTP Request and HTTP Response.\n\nBy using headers effectively, you can optimize the performance and security of your application on Vercel's edge network. Here are some tips for using headers on Vercel:\n\n1.  [Use caching headers](#cache-control-header): Caching headers instruct the client and server to cache resources like images, CSS files, and JavaScript files, so they don't need to be reloaded every time a user visits your site. By using caching headers, you can significantly reduce the time it takes for your site to load.\n2.  [Use compression headers](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/compression#compression-with-vercel-edge-network): Use the `Accept-Encoding` header to tell the client and server to compress data before it's sent over the network. By using compression, you can reduce the amount of data that needs to be sent, resulting in faster load times.\n3.  Use custom headers: You can also use custom headers in your `vercel.json` file to add metadata specific to your application. For example, you could add a header that indicates the user's preferred language or the version of your application. See [Project Configuration](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/project-configuration#headers) docs for more information.\n\nThe following headers are sent to each Vercel deployment and can be used to process the request before sending back a response. These headers can be read from the [Request](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_message_headers) object in your [Serverless Function](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/serverless-functions).\n\nThis header represents the domain name as it was accessed by the client. If the deployment has been assigned to a preview URL or production domain and the client visits the domain URL, it contains the custom domain instead of the underlying deployment URL.\n\nThis header contains a list of [Edge regions](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/regions) your request hit, as well as the region the function was executed in (for both Edge and Serverless).\n\nIt also allows Vercel to automatically prevent infinite loops.\n\nThis header is identical to the `host` header.\n\nThis header represents the protocol of the forwarded server, typically `https` in production and `http`in development.\n\nThe public IP address of the client that made the request.\n\nIf you are trying to use Vercel behind a proxy, we currently overwrite the [`X-Forwarded-For`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Forwarded-For) header and do not forward external IPs. This restriction is in place to prevent IP spoofing.\n\nEnterprise customers can purchase and enable a trusted proxy to allow your custom `X-Forwarded-For` IP. [Contact us](https://vercel.com/contact/sales) for more information.\n\nThis header is identical to the `x-forwarded-for` header. However, `x-forwarded-for` could be overwritten if you're using a proxy on top of Vercel.\n\nThis header is identical to the `x-forwarded-for` header.\n\nThis header represents the unique deployment, not the preview URL or production domain. For example, `*.vercel.app`.\n\nA two-character [ISO 3166-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1) code representing the continent associated with the location of the requester's public IP address. Codes used to identify continents are as follows:\n\n*   `AF` for Africa\n*   `AN` for Antarctica\n*   `AS` for Asia\n*   `EU` for Europe\n*   `NA` for North America\n*   `OC` for Oceania\n*   `SA` for South America\n\nA two-character [ISO 3166-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1) country code for the country associated with the location of the requester's public IP address.\n\nA string of up to three characters containing the region-portion of the [ISO 3166-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2) code for the first level region associated with the requester's public IP address. Some countries have two levels of subdivisions, in which case this is the least specific one. For example, in the United Kingdom this will be a country like \"England\", not a county like \"Devon\".\n\nThe city name for the location of the requester's public IP address. Non-ASCII characters are encoded according to [RFC3986](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986).\n\nThe latitude for the location of the requester's public IP address. For example, `37.7749`.\n\nThe longitude for the location of the requester's public IP address. For example, `-122.4194`.\n\nThe name of the time zone for the location of the requester’s public IP address in ICANN Time Zone Database name format such as `America/Chicago`.\n\nThe signature of the request. This header is used to verify that the request was sent by Vercel, and contains a hash signature you can use to validate the request body.\n\nThe following headers are included in Vercel deployment responses and indicate certain factors of the environment. These headers can be viewed from the Browser's Dev Tools or using an HTTP client such as `curl -I <DEPLOYMENT_URL>`.\n\nUsed to specify directives for caching mechanisms in both the [Network layer cache](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/caching) and the browser cache. See the [Cache Control Headers](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/headers#cache-control-header) section for more detail.\n\nIf you use this header to instruct the Edge Network to cache data, such as with the [`s-maxage`](#s-maxage) directive, Vercel returns the following `cache-control` header to the client:\n\n\\-`cache-control: public, max-age=0, must-revalidate`\n\nAn integer that indicates the number of bytes in the response.\n\nThe [media type](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types) that describes the nature and format of the response.\n\nA timestamp indicating when the response was generated.\n\nShows where the request came from. This header can be overridden by other proxies (e.g., Cloudflare).\n\nA header often abbreviated as [HSTS](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Glossary/HSTS) that tells browsers that the resource should only be requested over HTTPS. The default value is `strict-transport-security: max-age=63072000` (2 years)\n\nPresent only on:\n\n*   [Preview Deployments](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/preview-deployments)\n*   Outdated [Production Deployments](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/overview). When you [promote a new deployment to production](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/managing-deployments#promote-deployment-to-production), the `x-robots-tag` header will be sent to requests for outdated production deployments\n\nWe add this header automatically with a value of `noindex` to prevent search engines from crawling your Preview Deployments and outdated Production Deployments, which could cause them to penalize your site for duplicate content.\n\nYou can prevent this header from being added to your Preview Deployment by:\n\nThis header's value indicates whether the response was served from Vercel's edge cache.\n\nThe following values are possible when the content being served [is static](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/caching#static-files-caching) or uses [a Cache-Control header](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/headers#cache-control-header):\n\n[`MISS`](#miss): The response was not found in the edge cache and was fetched from the origin server\n\nShow Diagram\n\n[`HIT`](#hit): The response was served from the edge cache.\n\nShow Diagram\n\n[`STALE`](#stale): The response was served from the edge cache. A background request to the origin server was made to update the content.\n\nShow Diagram\n\n[`PRERENDER`](#prerender): The response was served from static storage.\n\nShow Diagram\n\nThis header contains a list of [Edge regions](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/regions) your request hit, as well as the region the function was executed in (for both Edge and Serverless).\n\nIt also allows Vercel to automatically prevent infinite loops.\n\nYou can control how Vercel's Edge Network caches your Function responses by setting a [Cache-Control](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cache-Control) header.\n\nThe default value is `cache-control: public, max-age=0, must-revalidate` which instructs both the Edge Network and the browser not to cache.\n\nWe recommend that you set your cache to`max-age=0, s-maxage=86400`, adjusting 86400 to the number of seconds you want the response cached. This configuration tells browsers not to cache, allowing Vercel's Edge Network to cache responses and invalidate them when deployments update.\n\nThis directive sets the number of seconds a response is considered \"fresh\" by the Edge Network. After this period ends, Vercel's Edge Network will serve the \"stale\" response from the edge until the response is asynchronously revalidated with a \"fresh\" response to your Serverless Function.\n\n`s-maxage` is consumed by Vercel's proxy and not included as part the final HTTP response to the client.\n\nThe following example instructs the Edge Network to cache the response for 60 seconds. A response can be cached a minimum of `1` second and maximum of `31536000` seconds (1 year).\n\n```\nCache-Control: s-maxage=60\n```\n\nThis `cache-control` directive allows you to serve content from the Edge cache while simultaneously updating the cache in the background with the response from your function. It is useful when:\n\n*   Your content changes frequently, but regeneration is slow, such as content that relies on an expensive database query or upstream API request\n*   Your content changes infrequently but you want to have the flexibility to update it without waiting for the cache to expire\n\n`stale-while-revalidate` is consumed by Vercel's proxy and not included as part the final HTTP response to the client. This allows you to deliver the latest content to your visitors right after creating a new deployment (as opposed to waiting for browser cache to expire). It also prevents content-flash.\n\nThe following example instructs the Edge Network to:\n\n*   Serve content from the Edge cache for 1 second\n*   Return a stale request (if requested after 1 second)\n*   Update the cache in the background asynchronously (if requested after 1 second)\n\n```\nCache-Control: s-maxage=1, stale-while-revalidate=59\n```\n\nThe first request is served synchronously. Subsequent requests are served from the cache and revalidated asynchronously if the cache is \"stale\".\n\nIf you need to do a _synchronous_ revalidation you can set the `pragma: no-cache` header along with the `cache-control` header. This can be used to understand how long the background revalidation took. It sets the `x-vercel-cache` header to `REVALIDATED`.\n\nMany browser developer tools set `pragma: no-cache` by default, which reveals the true load time of the page with the synchronous update to the cache.\n\nThis directive is currently not supported. `stale-if-error` is consumed by Vercel's proxy, and will not be included in the HTTP response sent to the client.\n\nThis directive is currently not supported.\n\nUsing the `private` directive specifies that the response can only be cached by the client and not by Vercel's Edge Network. Use this directive when you want to cache content on the user's browser, but prevent caching on Vercel's Edge Network.\n\nWhen Vercel's Edge Network CDN receives a request with `Pragma: no-cache` (such as when the browser devtools are open), it will revalidate any stale resource synchronously, instead of in the background.\n\nSometimes the directives you set in a `Cache-Control` header can be interpreted differently by the different CDNs and proxies your content passes through between the origin server and a visitor's browser. To explicitly control caching you can use targeted cache control headers.\n\nThe `CDN-Cache-Control` and `Vercel-CDN-Cache-Control` headers are response headers that can be used to specify caching behavior on the Edge Network and/or CDNs.\n\nYou can use the same directives as [`Cache-Control`](#cache-control-header), but `CDN-Cache-Control` is only used by the Edge Network and CDNs.\n\nOrigins can set the following headers:\n\n*   `Vercel-CDN-Cache-Control`\n*   `CDN-Cache-Control`\n*   `Cache-Control`\n\nWhen multiple of the above headers are set, Vercel's Edge Network will use the following priority to determine the caching behavior:\n\n`Vercel-CDN-Cache-Control` is exclusive to Vercel and has top priority, whether it's defined in a Vercel Function response or a `vercel.json` file. It controls caching behavior only within Vercel's Edge Cache. It is removed from the response and not sent to the client or any CDNs.\n\n`CDN-Cache-Control` is second in priority after `Vercel-CDN-Cache-Control`, and always overrides `Cache-Control` headers, whether defined in a Vercel Function response or a `vercel.json` file.\n\nBy default, `CDN-Cache-Control` configures Vercel's Edge Cache and is used by other CDNs, allowing you to configure intermediary caches. If `Vercel-CDN-Cache-Control` is also set, `CDN-Cache-Control` only influences other CDN caches.\n\n`Cache-Control` is a web standard header and last in priority. If neither `CDN-Cache-Control` nor `Vercel-CDN-Cache-Control` are set, this header will be used by Vercel's Edge Cache before being forwarded to the client.\n\nYou can still set `Cache-Control` while using the other two, and it will be forwarded to the client as is.\n\nIf only `Cache-Control` is used, Vercel strips the `s-maxage` directive from the header before it's sent to the client.\n\nThe following tables demonstrate how Vercel's Edge Cache behaves in different scenarios:\n\n`Cache-Control` headers returned from Vercel Functions take priority over `Cache-Control` headers from `next.config.js` or `vercel.json` files.\n\n| Parameter | Value |\n| --- | --- |\n| Vercel Function response headers | `Cache-Control: s-maxage=60` |\n| `vercel.json` or `next.config.js` headers | `Cache-Control: s-maxage: 120` |\n| Cache behavior | 60s TTL |\n| Headers sent to the client | `Cache-Control: public, max-age: 0` |\n\n`CDN-Cache-Control` has priority over `Cache-Control`, even if defined in `vercel.json` or `next.config.js`.\n\n| Parameter | Value |\n| --- | --- |\n| Vercel Function response headers | `Cache-Control: s-maxage=60` |\n| `vercel.json` or `next.config.js` headers | `CDN-Cache-Control: max-age=120` |\n| Cache behavior | 120s TTL |\n| Headers sent to the client | `Cache-Control: s-maxage=60 CDN-Cache-Control: max-age=120` |\n\n`Vercel-CDN-Cache-Control` has priority over both `CDN-Cache-Control` and `Cache-Control`. It only applies to Vercel, so it is not returned with the other headers, which will control cache behavior on the browser and other CDNs.\n\n| Parameter | Value |\n| --- | --- |\n| Vercel Function response headers | `CDN-Cache-Control: max-age=120` |\n| `vercel.json` or `next.config.js` headers | `Cache-Control: s-maxage=60 Vercel-CDN-Cache-Control: max-age=300` |\n| Cache behavior | 300s TTL |\n| Headers sent to the client | `Cache-Control: s-maxage=60 CDN-Cache-Control: max-age=120` |\n\n*   If you want to control caching similarly on Vercel, CDNs, and the client, use `Cache-Control`\n*   If you want to control caching on Vercel and also on other CDNs, use `CDN-Cache-Control`\n*   If you want to control caching only on Vercel, use `Vercel-CDN-Cache-Control`\n*   If you want to specify different caching behaviors for Vercel, other CDNs, and the client, you can set all three headers\n\nThe following example demonstrates `Cache-Control` headers that instruct:\n\n*   Vercel's Edge Cache to have a [TTL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_to_live) of `3600` seconds\n*   Downstream CDNs to have a TTL of `60` seconds\n*   Clients to have a TTL of `10` seconds\n\n```\nexport async function GET() {\n  return new Response('Cache Control example', {\n    status: 200,\n    headers: {\n      'Cache-Control': 'max-age=10',\n      'CDN-Cache-Control': 'max-age=60',\n      'Vercel-CDN-Cache-Control': 'max-age=3600',\n    },\n  });\n}\n```\n\nUsing configuration, you can assign custom headers to each response.\n\nCustom headers can be configured with the `headers` property in [`next.config.js`](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next.config.js/headers) for Next.js projects, or it can be configured in [`vercel.json`](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/project-configuration#headers) for all other projects.\n\nAlternatively, a [Serverless Function](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/serverless-functions) can assign headers to the [Response](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_response_setheader_name_value) object.\n\nResponse headers `x-matched-path`, `server`, and `content-length` are reserved and cannot be modified.",

    "markdown": "# Next.js on Vercel\n\n[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is a fullstack React framework for the web, maintained by Vercel.\n\nWhile Next.js works when self-hosting, deploying to Vercel is zero-configuration and provides additional enhancements for scalability, availability, and performance globally.\n\nTo get started with Next.js on Vercel:\n\n*   If you already have a project with Next.js, install [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/docs/cli) and run the `vercel` command from your project's root directory\n*   Clone one of our Next.js example repos to your favorite git provider and deploy it on Vercel with the button below:\n\nVercel deployments can [integrate with your git provider](https://vercel.com/docs/git) to [generate preview URLs](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/preview-deployments) for each pull request you make to your Next.js project.\n\n[Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)](https://vercel.com/docs/incremental-static-regeneration) allows you to create or update content _without_ redeploying your site. ISR has three main benefits for developers: better performance, improved security, and faster build times.\n\nWhen self-hosting, (ISR) is limited to a single region workload. Statically generated pages are not distributed closer to visitors by default, without additional configuration or vendoring of a CDN. By default, self-hosted ISR does _not_ persist generated pages to durable storage. Instead, these files are located in the Next.js cache (which expires).\n\nTo enable ISR with Next.js in the `app` router, add an options object with a `revalidate` property to your `fetch` requests:\n\n```\nawait fetch('https://api.vercel.app/blog', {\n  next: { revalidate: 10 }, // Seconds\n});\n```\n\nTo summarize, using ISR with Next.js on Vercel:\n\n*   Better performance with our global [Edge Network](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/overview)\n*   Zero-downtime rollouts to previously statically generated pages\n*   Framework-aware infrastructure enables global content updates in 300ms\n*   Generated pages are both cached and persisted to durable storage\n\n[Learn more about Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)](https://vercel.com/docs/incremental-static-regeneration)\n\nServer-Side Rendering (SSR) allows you to render pages dynamically on the server. This is useful for pages where the rendered data needs to be unique on every request. For example, checking authentication or looking at the location of an incoming request.\n\nOn Vercel, you can server-render Next.js applications in either the Node.js runtime (default) with [Serverless Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/serverless-functions) or the Edge runtime with [Edge Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/edge-functions). This allows you to pick the best rendering strategy on a per-page basis.\n\nTo summarize, SSR with Next.js on Vercel:\n\n*   Scales to zero when not in use\n*   Scales automatically with traffic increases\n*   Has zero-configuration support for [`Cache-Control` headers](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/caching), including `stale-while-revalidate`\n*   Framework-aware infrastructure enables switching rendering between Edge/Node.js runtimes\n\n[Learn more about SSR](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering#static-and-dynamic-rendering-on-the-server)\n\nVercel supports streaming in Next.js projects with any of the following:\n\n*   [Route Handlers](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/router-handlers)\n*   Edge Functions\n*   React Server Components\n\nStreaming data allows you to fetch information in chunks rather than all at once, speeding up Function responses. You can use streams to improve your app's user experience and prevent your Serverless and Edge Functions from failing when fetching large files.\n\nSee the [streaming quickstart](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/streaming/quickstart) to start streaming with Next.js on Vercel.\n\nIn Next.js 13 (using the `app` directory), you can use the `loading` file convention or a `Suspense` component to show an instant loading state from the server while the content of a route segment loads.\n\nThe `loading` file provides a way to show a loading state for a whole route or route-segment, instead of just particular sections of a page. This file affects all its child elements, including layouts and pages. It continues to display its contents until the data fetching process in the route segment completes.\n\nThe following example demonstrates a basic `loading` file:\n\n```\nexport default function Loading() {\n  return <p>Loading...</p>;\n}\n```\n\nLearn more about loading in the [Next.js docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/loading-ui-and-streaming).\n\nThe `Suspense` component, introduced in React 18, enables you to display a fallback until components nested within it have finished loading. Using `Suspense` is more granular than showing a loading state for an entire route, and is useful when only sections of your UI need a loading state.\n\nYou can specify a component to show during the loading state with the `fallback` prop on the `Suspense` component as shown below:\n\n```\nimport { Suspense } from 'react';\nimport { PostFeed, Weather } from './components';\n \nexport default function Posts() {\n  return (\n    <section>\n      <Suspense fallback={<p>Loading feed...</p>}>\n        <PostFeed />\n      </Suspense>\n      <Suspense fallback={<p>Loading weather...</p>}>\n        <Weather />\n      </Suspense>\n    </section>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nTo summarize, using Streaming with Next.js on Vercel:\n\n*   Speeds up Function response times, improving your app's user experience\n*   Allows you to fetch large data without exceeding Edge and Serverless Function file size limits\n*   Display initial loading UI with incremental updates from the server as new data becomes available\n\nLearn more about [Streaming](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/streaming) with Vercel Functions.\n\n[Next.js 14](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-14) introduces Partial Prerendering as an experimental feature. It is currently **not suitable for production** environments and is incompatible with the [Edge Runtime](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/edge-functions/edge-runtime) .\n\nPartial Prerendering (PPR) is an experimental feature in Next.js 14 that allows the static portions of a page to be pre-generated and served from the cache, while the dynamic portions are streamed in a single HTTP request.\n\nWhen a user visits a route:\n\n*   A static route _shell_ is served immediately, this makes the initial load fast.\n*   The shell leaves _holes_ where dynamic content will be streamed in to minimize the perceived overall page load time.\n*   The async holes are loaded in parallel, reducing the overall load time of the page.\n\nThis approach is useful for pages like dashboards, where unique, per-request data coexists with static elements such as sidebars or layouts. This is different from how your application behaves today, where entire routes are either fully static or dynamic.\n\nSee the [Partial Prerendering docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/partial-prerendering) to learn more.\n\n[Image Optimization](https://vercel.com/docs/image-optimization) helps you achieve faster page loads by reducing the size of images and using modern image formats.\n\nWhen deploying to Vercel, images are automatically optimized on demand, keeping your build times fast while improving your page load performance and [Core Web Vitals](https://vercel.com/docs/speed-insights).\n\nWhen self-hosting, Image Optimization uses the default Next.js server for optimization. This server manages the rendering of pages and serving of static files.\n\nTo use Image Optimization with Next.js on Vercel, import the `next/image` component into the component you'd like to add an image to, as shown in the following example:\n\n```\nimport Image from 'next/image'\n \ninterface ExampleProps {\n  name: string;\n}\n \nconst ExampleComponent = (props: ExampleProps) : => {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Image\n        src=\"example.png\"\n        alt=\"Example picture\"\n        width={500}\n        height={500}\n      />\n      <span>{props.name}</span>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nTo summarize, using Image Optimization with Next.js on Vercel:\n\n*   Zero-configuration Image Optimization when using `next/image`\n*   Helps your team ensure great performance by default\n*   Keeps your builds fast by optimizing images on-demand\n*   Requires No additional services needed to procure or set up\n\n[Learn more about Image Optimization](https://vercel.com/docs/image-optimization)\n\n[`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) enables built-in automatic self-hosting for any font file. This means you can optimally load web fonts with zero [layout shift](https://vercel.com/docs/speed-insights#cumulative-layout-shift-cls), thanks to the underlying CSS [`size-adjust`](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/@font-face/size-adjust) property.\n\nThis also allows you to use all [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) with performance and privacy in mind. CSS and font files are downloaded at build time and self-hosted with the rest of your static files. No requests are sent to Google by the browser.\n\n```\nimport { Inter } from 'next/font/google';\n \n// If loading a variable font, you don't need to specify the font weight\nconst inter = Inter({\n  subsets: ['latin'],\n  display: 'swap',\n});\n \nexport default function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode;\n}) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\" className={inter.className}>\n      <body>{children}</body>\n    </html>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nTo summarize, using Font Optimization with Next.js on Vercel:\n\n*   Enables built-in, automatic self-hosting for font files\n*   Loads web fonts with zero layout shift\n*   Allows for CSS and font files to be downloaded at build time and self-hosted with the rest of your static files\n*   Ensures that no requests are sent to Google by the browser\n\n[Learn more about Font Optimization](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts)\n\nDynamic social card images (using the [Open Graph protocol](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/edge-functions/og-image-generation)) allow you to create a unique image for every page of your site. This is useful when sharing links on the web through social platforms or through text message.\n\nThe [Vercel OG](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/edge-functions/og-image-generation) image generation library allows you generate fast, dynamic social card images using Next.js API Routes.\n\nOn Vercel, your Next.js API Routes using Vercel OG are automatically optimized using Vercel Edge Functions and WebAssembly. This enables social card images to be generated faster, cheaper, and more scalable than self-hosted Next.js.\n\nThe following example demonstrates using OG image generation in both the Next.js Pages and App Router:\n\n```\nimport { ImageResponse } from 'next/og';\n// App router includes @vercel/og.\n// No need to install it.\n \nexport const runtime = 'edge';\n \nexport async function GET(request: Request) {\n  return new ImageResponse(\n    (\n      <div\n        style={{\n          fontSize: 128,\n          background: 'white',\n          width: '100%',\n          height: '100%',\n          display: 'flex',\n          textAlign: 'center',\n          alignItems: 'center',\n          justifyContent: 'center',\n        }}\n      >\n        Hello world!\n      </div>\n    ),\n    {\n      width: 1200,\n      height: 600,\n    },\n  );\n}\n```\n\nTo see your generated image, run `npm run dev` in your terminal and visit the `/api/og` route in your browser (most likely `http://localhost:3000/api/og`).\n\nTo summarize, the benefits of using Vercel OG with Next.js include:\n\n*   Instant, dynamic social card images without needing headless browsers\n*   Generated images are automatically cached on the Vercel Edge Network\n*   Image generation is co-located with the rest of your frontend codebase\n\n[Learn more about OG Image Generation](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/edge-functions/og-image-generation)\n\n[Middleware](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/edge-middleware) is code that executes before a request is processed. Because Middleware runs before the cache, it's an effective way of providing personalization to statically generated content.\n\nWhen deploying middleware with Next.js on Vercel, you get access to built-in helpers that expose each request's geolocation information. You also get access to the `NextRequest` and `NextResponse` objects, which enable rewrites, continuing the middleware chain, and more.\n\nSee [the Middleware API docs](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/edge-middleware/middleware-api#middleware-helper-methods) for more information.\n\nTo summarize, Middleware with Next.js on Vercel:\n\n*   Runs using [Edge Middleware](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/edge-middleware) which are deployed globally\n*   Replaces needing additional services for customizable routing rules\n*   Helps you achieve the best performance for serving content globally\n\n[Learn more about Edge Middleware](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/edge-middleware)\n\n[Draft Mode](https://vercel.com/docs/workflow-collaboration/draft-mode) enables you to view draft content from your [Headless CMS](https://vercel.com/docs/solutions/cms) immediately, while still statically generating pages in production.\n\nSee [our Draft Mode docs](https://vercel.com/docs/workflow-collaboration/draft-mode#using-draft-mode-with-next.js) to learn how to use it with Next.js.\n\nWhen self-hosting, every request using Draft Mode hits the Next.js server, potentially incurring extra load or cost. Further, by spoofing the cookie, malicious users could attempt to gain access to your underlying Next.js server.\n\nDeployments on Vercel automatically secure Draft Mode behind the same authentication used for Preview Comments. In order to enable or disable Draft Mode, the viewer must be logged in as a member of the [Team](https://vercel.com/docs/teams-and-accounts). Once enabled, Vercel's Edge Network will bypass the ISR cache automatically and invoke the underlying [Serverless Function](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/serverless-functions).\n\nYou and your team members can toggle Draft Mode in the Vercel Toolbar in [production](https://vercel.com/docs/workflow-collaboration/comments/in-production-and-localhost#using-@vercel/toolbar-in-production), [localhost](https://vercel.com/docs/workflow-collaboration/comments/in-production-and-localhost#using-@vercel/toolbar-in-localhost), and [Preview Deployments](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/preview-deployments#comments). When you do so, the toolbar will become purple to indicate Draft Mode is active.\n\n![The Vercel toolbar when Draft Mode is enabled.](https://vercel.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.vercel.com%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1689795055%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Fworkflow-collaboration%2Fdraft-mode%2Fdraft-toolbar1-light.png&w=828&q=75&dpl=dpl_6RGLzPaeBNhuWHRxN1xTYtAhKUa3)![The Vercel toolbar when Draft Mode is enabled.](https://vercel.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.vercel.com%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1689795055%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Fworkflow-collaboration%2Fdraft-mode%2Fdraft-toolbar1-dark.png&w=828&q=75&dpl=dpl_6RGLzPaeBNhuWHRxN1xTYtAhKUa3)\n\nThe Vercel toolbar when Draft Mode is enabled.\n\nUsers outside your Vercel team cannot toggle Draft Mode.\n\nTo summarize, the benefits of using Draft Mode with Next.js on Vercel include:\n\n*   Easily server-render previews of static pages\n*   Adds additional security measures to prevent malicious usage\n*   Integrates with any headless provider of your choice\n*   You can enable and disable Draft Mode in [the comments toolbar](https://vercel.com/docs/workflow-collaboration/comments/how-comments-work) on Preview Deployments\n\n[Learn more about Draft Mode](https://vercel.com/docs/workflow-collaboration/draft-mode)\n\nVercel's Web Analytics features enable you to visualize and monitor your application's performance over time. The Analytics tab in your project's dashboard offers detailed insights into your website's visitors, with metrics like top pages, top referrers, and user demographics.\n\nTo use Web Analytics, navigate to the Analytics tab of your project dashboard on Vercel and select Enable in the modal that appears.\n\nTo track visitors and page views, we recommend first installing our `@vercel/analytics` package by running the terminal command below in the root directory of your Next.js project:\n\nThen, follow the instructions below to add the `Analytics` component to your app either using the `pages` directory or the `app` directory.\n\nThe `Analytics` component is a wrapper around the tracking script, offering more seamless integration with Next.js.\n\nAdd the following component to the root layout.\n\n```\nimport { Analytics } from '@vercel/analytics/react';\n \nexport default function RootLayout({\n  children,\n}: {\n  children: React.ReactNode;\n}) {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <head>\n        <title>Next.js</title>\n      </head>\n      <body>\n        {children}\n        <Analytics />\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nTo summarize, Web Analytics with Next.js on Vercel:\n\n*   Enables you to track traffic and see your top-performing pages\n*   Offers you detailed breakdowns of visitor demographics, including their OS, browser, geolocation, and more\n\n[Learn more about Web Analytics](https://vercel.com/docs/analytics)\n\nYou can see data about your project's [Core Web Vitals](https://vercel.com/docs/speed-insights#core-web-vitals-explained) performance in your dashboard on Vercel. Doing so will allow you to track your web application's loading speed, responsiveness, and visual stability so you can improve the overall user experience.\n\nOn Vercel, you can track your Next.js app's Core Web Vitals in your project's dashboard.\n\nIf you're self-hosting your app, you can use the [`useWebVitals`](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/measuring-performance#build-your-own) hook to send metrics to any analytics provider. The following example demonstrates a custom `WebVitals` component that you can use in your app's root `layout` file:\n\n```\n'use client';\n \nimport { useReportWebVitals } from 'next/web-vitals';\n \nexport function WebVitals() {\n  useReportWebVitals((metric) => {\n    console.log(metric);\n  });\n}\n```\n\nYou could then reference your custom `WebVitals` component like this:\n\n```\nimport { WebVitals } from './_components/web-vitals';\n \nexport default function Layout({ children }) {\n  return (\n    <html>\n      <body>\n        <WebVitals />\n        {children}\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nNext.js uses [Google's `web-vitals` library](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/web-vitals#web-vitals) to measure the Web Vitals metrics available in `reportWebVitals`.\n\nTo summarize, tracking Web Vitals with Next.js on Vercel:\n\n*   Enables you to track traffic performance metrics, such as [First Contentful Paint](https://vercel.com/docs/speed-insights#first-contentful-paint-fcp), or [First Input Delay](https://vercel.com/docs/speed-insights#first-input-delay-fid)\n*   Enables you to view performance analytics by page name and URL for more granular analysis\n*   Shows you [a score for your app's performance](https://vercel.com/docs/speed-insights#how-the-scores-are-determined) on each recorded metric, which you can use to track improvements or regressions\n\n[Learn more about Speed Insights](https://vercel.com/docs/speed-insights)\n\nVercel has partnered with popular service providers, such as MongoDB and Sanity, to create integrations that make using those services with Next.js easier. There are many integrations across multiple categories, such as [Commerce](https://vercel.com/integrations#commerce), [Databases](https://vercel.com/integrations#databases), and [Logging](https://vercel.com/integrations#logging).\n\nTo summarize, Integrations on Vercel:\n\n*   Simplify the process of connecting your preferred services to a Vercel project\n*   Help you achieve the optimal setup for a Vercel project using your preferred service\n*   Configure your environment variables for you\n\n[Learn more about Integrations](https://vercel.com/integrations)\n\nSee [our Frameworks documentation page](https://vercel.com/docs/frameworks) to learn about the benefits available to all frameworks when you deploy on Vercel.\n\nLearn more about deploying Next.js projects on Vercel with the following resources:",

    "markdown": "# Create React App on Vercel\n\nCreate React App (CRA) is a development environment for building single-page applications with the React framework. It sets up and configures a new React project with the latest JavaScript features, and optimizes your app for production.\n\nTo get started with CRA on Vercel:\n\n*   If you already have a project with CRA, install [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/docs/cli) and run the `vercel` command from your project's root directory\n*   Clone one of our CRA example repos to your favorite git provider and deploy it on Vercel with the button below:\n\nVercel deployments can [integrate with your git provider](https://vercel.com/docs/git) to [generate preview URLs](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/preview-deployments) for each pull request you make to your CRA project.\n\nYou can also use CRA in [our Edge Runtime](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/edge-functions/edge-functions-api) with our [React on the Edge](https://vercel.com/templates/react/react-edge-functions) example project.\n\nOn Vercel, static files are [replicated and deployed to every region in our global Edge Network after the first request](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/caching#static-files-caching). This ensures that static files are served from the closest location to the visitor, improving performance and reducing latency.\n\nStatic files are cached for up to 31 days. If a file is unchanged, it can persist across deployments, as their hash caches static files. However, the cache is effectively invalidated when you redeploy, so we always serve the latest version.\n\nTo summarize, using Static Files with CRA on Vercel:\n\n*   Automatically optimizes and caches assets for the best performance\n*   Makes files easily accessible through the `public` folder\n*   Supports zero-downtime rollouts\n*   Requires no additional services needed to procure or set up\n\n[Learn more about Static Files Caching](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/caching#static-files-caching)\n\nWhen you deploy your CRA app to Vercel and connect your git repo, every pull request will generate a [Preview Deployment](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/preview-deployments).\n\nPreview Deployments allow you to preview changes to your app in a live deployment. They are available by default for all projects, and are generated when you commit changes to a Git branch with an open pull request, or you create a deployment [using Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/docs/cli/deploy#usage).\n\nYou can use the comments feature to receive feedback on your Preview Deployments from Vercel Team members and [people you share the Preview URL with](https://vercel.com/docs/workflow-collaboration/comments/how-comments-work#sharing).\n\nComments allow you to start discussion threads, share screenshots, send notifications, and more.\n\nTo summarize, Preview Deployments with CRA on Vercel:\n\n*   Enable you to share previews of pull request changes in a live environment\n*   Come with a comment feature for improved collaboration and feedback\n*   Experience changes to your product without merging them to your deployment branch\n\n[Learn more about Preview Deployments](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/preview-deployments)\n\nEdge Functions are a fast, scalable solution for delivering dynamic content to users. By default, Edge Functions are deployed globally, and will be invoked in one of Vercel's datacenters near your site's visitors.\n\nEdge Functions are ideal when you need to interact with data over the network as fast as possible, such as executing OAuth callbacks, responding to webhook requests, or interacting with an API that fails if a request is not completed within a short time limit.\n\nYou can't use Edge Functions with CRA without using our Build Output API, which we do not recommend. We recommend using Edge Functions with a framework such as [Next.js](https://vercel.com/docs/frameworks/nextjs), [SvelteKit](https://vercel.com/docs/frameworks/sveltekit), Nuxt, or [any of the popular frameworks we support](https://vercel.com/docs/frameworks/more-frameworks).\n\nIf you are a framework builder, or you're interested in implementing our Build Output API spec, you can see an example of Edge Functions working in React with [our React on the Edge example project](https://vercel.com/templates/react/react-edge-functions).\n\nTo summarize, Edge Functions with CRA on Vercel:\n\n*   Enable you to respond to user requests with dynamic content at low latency, at scale\n*   Offer cost savings by using fewer resources than Serverless Functions\n*   Can execute in the region nearest to your users or nearest to data sources they depend on, based on your configuration\n*   Have access to the geolocation and IP address of visitors, enabling location-based personalization\n\n[Learn more about Edge Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/edge-functions)\n\nVercel's Web Analytics features enable you to visualize and monitor your application's performance over time. The Analytics tab in your project's dashboard offers detailed insights into your website's visitors, with metrics like top pages, top referrers, and user demographics.\n\nTo use Web Analytics, navigate to the Analytics tab of your project dashboard on Vercel and select Enable in the modal that appears.\n\nTo track visitors and page views, we recommend first installing our `@vercel/analytics` package.\n\nYou can then import the `inject` function from the package, which will add the tracking script to your app. This should only be called once in your app.\n\nAdd the following code to your main app file:\n\n```\nimport { inject } from '@vercel/analytics';\n \ninject();\n```\n\nThen, [ensure you've enabled Web Analytics in your dashboard on Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/analytics/quickstart). You should start seeing usage data in your Vercel dashboard.\n\nTo summarize, using Web Analytics with CRA on Vercel:\n\n*   Enables you to track traffic and see your top-performing pages\n*   Offers you detailed breakdowns of visitor demographics, including their OS, browser, geolocation and more\n\n[Learn more about Web Analytics](https://vercel.com/docs/analytics)\n\nYou can see data about your CRA project's [Core Web Vitals](https://vercel.com/docs/speed-insights#core-web-vitals-explained) performance in your dashboard on Vercel.

    "markdown": "# Astro on Vercel\n\nAstro is an all-in-one web framework that enables you to build performant static websites. People choose Astro when they want to build content-rich experiences with as little JavaScript as possible.\n\nYou can deploy a static Astro app to Vercel with zero configuration.\n\nTo get started with Astro on Vercel:\n\n*   If you already have a project with Astro, install [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/docs/cli) and run the `vercel` command from your project's root directory\n*   Clone one of our Astro example repos to your favorite git provider and deploy it on Vercel with the button below:\n\nVercel deployments can [integrate with your git provider](https://vercel.com/docs/git) to [generate preview URLs](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/preview-deployments) for each pull request you make to your Astro project.\n\nTo deploy a server-rendered Astro app, or a static Astro site with Vercel features like Web Analytics and Image Optimization, you must:\n\n1.  Add [Astro's Vercel adapter](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/vercel) to your project. There are two ways to do so:\n    \n    *   Using `astro add`, which configures the adapter for you with default settings. Using `astro add` will generate a preconfigured `astro.config.ts` with opinionated default settings\n    *   Or, manually installing the [`@astrojs/vercel`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@astrojs/vercel) package. You should manually install the adapter if you don't want an opinionated initial configuration\n2.  Configure your project. In your `astro.config.ts` file, import either the `serverless` or `static` plugin, and set the output to `server` or `static` respectively:\n    \n    ```\n    import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';\n    // Import /serverless for a Serverless SSR site\n    import vercelServerless from '@astrojs/vercel/serverless';\n     \n    export default defineConfig({\n      output: 'server',\n      adapter: vercelServerless(),\n    });\n    ```\n    \n3.  Enable Vercel's features using Astro's [configuration options](#configuration-options). The following example `astro.config.ts` enables Web Analytics and adds a maximum duration to Serverless Function routes:\n    \n    ```\n    import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';\n    // Also can be @astrojs/vercel/static\n    import vercel from '@astrojs/vercel/serverless';\n     \n    export default defineConfig({\n      // Also can be 'static' or 'hybrid'\n      output: 'server',\n      adapter: vercel({\n        webAnalytics: {\n          enabled: true,\n        },\n        maxDuration: 8,\n      }),\n    });\n    ```\n    \n\nThe following configuration options enable Vercel's features for Astro deployments.\n\n| Option | type | Rendering | Purpose |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| [`maxDuration`](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/serverless-functions/runtimes#max-duration) | `number` | Serverless | Extends or limits the maximum duration (in seconds) that Serverless Functions can run before timing out. |\n| [`webAnalytics`](https://vercel.com/docs/analytics) | `{enabled: boolean}` | Static, Serverless | Enables Vercel's [Web Analytics](https://vercel.com/docs/analytics). See [the quickstart](https://vercel.com/docs/analytics/quickstart) to set up analytics on your account. |\n| [`imageService`](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/vercel/#imageservice) | `boolean` | Static, Serverless | For astro versions `3` and up. Enables an automatically [configured service](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/image-service-reference/#what-is-an-image-service) to optimize your images. |\n| [`devImageService`](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/vercel/#devimageservice) | `string` | Static, Serverless | For astro versions `3` and up. Configure the [image service](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/image-service-reference/#what-is-an-image-service) used to optimize your images in your dev environment. |\n| [`imagesConfig`](https://vercel.com/docs/build-output-api/v3/configuration#images) | `VercelImageConfig` | Static, Serverless | Defines the behavior of the Image Optimization API, allowing on-demand optimization at runtime. See [the Build Output API docs](https://vercel.com/docs/build-output-api/v3/configuration#images) for required options. |\n| [`functionPerRoute`](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/vercel/#function-bundling-configuration) | `boolean` | Serverless | API routes are bundled into one function by default. Set this to true to split each route into separate functions. |\n| [`edgeMiddleware`](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/vercel/#vercel-edge-middleware-with-astro-middleware) | `boolean` | Serverless | Set to `true` to automatically convert Astro middleware to Edge Middleware, eliminating the need for a `middleware.ts` file. |\n| [`includeFiles`](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/vercel/#includefiles) | `string[]` | Serverless | Force files to be bundled with your Serverless functions. |\n| [`excludeFiles`](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/vercel/#excludefiles) | `string[]` | Serverless | Exclude files from being bundled with your Serverless functions. Also available with [`.vercelignore`](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/vercel-ignore#) |\n\nFor more details on the configuration options, see [Astro's docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/vercel/#configuration).\n\nUsing SSR, or [on-demand rendering](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/server-side-rendering/) as Astro calls it, enables you to deploy your routes as Serverless Functions on Vercel. This allows you to add dynamic elements to your app, such as user logins and personalized content.\n\nYou can enable SSR by [adding the Vercel adapter to your project](#using-vercel's-features-with-astro).\n\nIf your Astro project is statically rendered, you can opt individual routes. To do so:\n\n1.  Set your `output` option to `hybrid` in your `<PreferredExtension filename=\"astro.config\" mjs />`:\n    \n    ```\n    import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';\n    import vercel from '@astrojs/vercel/serverless';\n     \n    export default defineConfig({\n      output: 'hybrid',\n      adapter: vercel({\n        edgeMiddleware: true,\n      }),\n    });\n    ```\n    \n2.  Add `export const prerender = false;` to your components:\n    \n    ```\n    ---\n    export const prerender = false;\n    // ...\n    ---\n    <html>\n      <!-- Server-rendered page here... -->\n    </html>\n    ```\n    \n\nSSR with Astro on Vercel:\n\n*   Scales to zero when not in use\n*   Scales automatically with traffic increases\n*   Has zero-configuration support for [`Cache-Control` headers](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/caching), including `stale-while-revalidate`\n\n[Learn more about Astro SSR](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/server-side-rendering/)\n\nStatically rendered, or pre-rendered, Astro apps can be deployed to Vercel with zero configuration. To enable Vercel features like Image Optimization or Web Analytics, see [Using Vercel's features with Astro](#using-vercel's-features-with-astro).\n\nYou can opt individual routes into static rendering with `export const prerender = true` as shown below:\n\n```\n---\nexport const prerender = true;\n// ...\n---\n<html>\n  <!-- Static, pre-rendered page here... -->\n</html>\n```\n\nStatically rendered Astro sites on Vercel:\n\n*   Require zero configuration to deploy\n*   Can use Vercel features with `astro.config.ts`\n\n[Learn more about Astro Static Rendering](https://docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/rendering-modes/#pre-rendered)\n\n[Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)](https://vercel.com/docs/incremental-static-regeneration) allows you to create or update content without redeploying your site. ISR has two main benefits for developers: better performance and faster build times.\n\nTo enable ISR in Astro, you need to use the [Vercel adapter](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/vercel/) and set `isr` to `true` in your configuration in `astro.config.mjs`:\n\nISR function requests do not include search params, similar to requests in static mode.\n\nUsing ISR with Astro on Vercel offers:\n\n*   Better performance with our global [Edge Network](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/overview)\n*   Zero-downtime rollouts to previously statically generated pages\n*   Global content updates in 300ms\n*   Generated pages are both cached and persisted to durable storage\n\n[Learn more about ISR with Astro.](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/vercel/#isr)\n\n[Serverless Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/serverless-functions) use resources that scale up and down based on traffic demands. This makes them reliable during peak hours, but low cost during slow periods.\n\nWhen you [enable SSR with Astro's Vercel adapter](#using-vercel's-features-with-astro), all of your routes will be server-rendered as Serverless Functions by default. Astro's [Server Endpoints](https://docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/endpoints/#server-endpoints-api-routes) are the best way to define Serverless API routes with Astro on Vercel.\n\nWhen defining an Endpoint, you must name each function after the HTTP method it represents. The following example defines basic HTTP methods in a Server Endpoint:\n\n```\nimport { APIRoute } from 'astro/dist/@types/astro';\n \nexport const GET: APIRoute = ({ params, request }) => {\n  return new Response(\n    JSON.stringify({\n      message: 'This was a GET!',\n    }),\n  );\n};\n \nexport const POST: APIRoute = ({ request }) => {\n  return new Response(\n    JSON.stringify({\n      message: 'This was a POST!',\n    }),\n  );\n};\n \nexport const DELETE: APIRoute = ({ request }) => {\n  return new Response(\n    JSON.stringify({\n      message: 'This was a DELETE!',\n    }),\n  );\n};\n \n// ALL matches any method that you haven't implemented.\nexport const ALL: APIRoute = ({ request }) => {\n  return new Response(\n    JSON.stringify({\n      message: `This was a ${request.method}!`,\n    }),\n  );\n};\n```\n\nAstro removes the final file during the build process, so the name of the file should include the extension of the data you want serve (for example `example.png.js` will become `/example.png`).\n\nServerless Functions with Astro on Vercel:\n\n*   Scale to zero when not in use\n*   Scale automatically as traffic increases\n\n[Learn more about Serverless Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/serverless-functions)\n\n[Edge Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/edge-functions) are a fast, scalable solution for delivering dynamic content to users. By default, Edge Functions are deployed globally, and will be invoked in one of Vercel's [Edge regions](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/regions) near your site's visitors.\n\nAstro does not currently support Edge Functions natively, however you can use the `/api` directory to define Edge Functions with any framework on Vercel. See [the Edge Functions quickstart](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/edge-functions/quickstart) to get started.\n\nEdge Functions with Nuxt on Vercel:\n\n*   Offer cost savings by using fewer resources than Serverless Functions\n*   Can execute in the region nearest to your users or nearest to data sources they depend on, based on your configuration\n*   Have access to the geolocation and IP address of visitors, enabling location-based personalization\n\n[Learn more about Edge Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/edge-functions)\n\n[Image Optimization](https://vercel.com/docs/image-optimization) helps you achieve faster page loads by reducing the size of images and using modern image formats. When deploying to Vercel, images are automatically optimized on demand, keeping your build times fast while improving your page load performance and [Core Web Vitals](https://vercel.com/docs/speed-insights/metrics#core-web-vitals-explained).\n\nImage Optimization with Astro on Vercel is supported out of the box with Astro's `Image` component. See [the Image Optimization quickstart](https://vercel.com/docs/image-optimization/quickstart) to learn more.\n\nImage Optimization with Astro on Vercel:\n\n*   Requires zero-configuration for Image Optimization when using Astro's `Image` component\n*   Helps your team ensure great performance by default\n*   Keeps your builds fast by optimizing images on-demand\n\n[Learn more about Image Optimization](https://vercel.com/docs/image-optimization)\n\n[Edge Middleware](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/edge-middleware) is code that executes before a request is processed on a site, enabling you to modify the response. Because it runs before the cache, Edge Middleware is an effective way to personalize statically generated content.\n\n[Astro middleware](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/middleware/#basic-usage) allows you to set and share information across your endpoints and pages with a `middleware.ts` file in your `src` directory. The following example edits the global `locals` object, adding data which will be available in any `.astro` file:\n\n```\n// This helper automatically types middleware params\nimport { defineMiddleware } from 'astro:middleware';\n \nexport const onRequest = defineMiddleware(({ locals }, next) => {\n  // intercept data from a request\n  // optionally, modify the properties in `locals`\n  locals.title = 'New title';\n \n  // return a Response or the result of calling `next()`\n  return next();\n});\n```\n\n**Astro middleware is not the same as Vercel's Edge Middleware**, which has to be placed at the root directory of your project, outside `src`.\n\nTo add custom properties to `locals` in `middleware.ts`, you must declare a global namespace in your `env.d.ts` file:\n\n```\ndeclare namespace App {\n  interface Locals {\n    title?: string;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nYou can then access the data you added to `locals` in any `.astro` file, like so:\n\n```\n---\nconst { title } = Astro.locals;\n---\n<h1>{title}</h1>\n<p>The name of this page is from middleware.</p>\n```\n\nYou can deploy Astro's middleware at the Edge, giving you access to data in the `RequestContext` and `Request`, and enabling you to use [Vercel's Edge Middleware helpers](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/edge-middleware/middleware-api#middleware-helper-methods), such as [`geolocation()`](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/edge-middleware/middleware-api#geolocation) or [`ipAddress()`](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/edge-middleware/middleware-api#geolocation).\n\nTo use Astro's middleware at the Edge, set `edgeMiddleware: true` in your `astro.config.ts` file:\n\n```\nimport { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';\nimport vercel from '@astrojs/vercel/serverless';\n \nexport default defineConfig({\n  output: 'server',\n  adapter: vercel({\n    edgeMiddleware: true,\n  }),\n});\n```\n\nIf you're using [Vercel's Edge Middleware](#using-vercel's-edge-middleware), you do not need to set `edgeMiddleware: true` in your `astro.config.ts` file.\n\nSee Astro's docs on [the limitations and constraints](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/vercel/#limitations-and-constraints) for using middleware at the Edge, as well as [their troubleshooting tips](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/vercel/#troubleshooting).\n\nThe `Astro.locals` object exposes data to your `.astro` components, allowing you to dynamically modify your content with middleware. To make changes to `Astro.locals` in Astro's middleware at the edge:\n\n1.  Add a new middleware file next to your `src/middleware.ts` and name it `src/vercel-edge-middleware.ts`. This file name is required to make changes to [`Astro.locals`](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/api-reference/#astrolocals). If you don't want to update `Astro.locals`, this step is not required\n    \n2.  Return an object with the properties you want to add to `Astro.locals`. :\n    \n    For TypeScript, you must install [the `@vercel/edge` package](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/edge-middleware/middleware-api#middleware-helper-methods):\n    \n    Then, type your middleware function like so:\n    \n    ```\n    import type { RequestContext } from '@vercel/edge';\n     \n    // Note the parameters are different from standard Astro middleware\n    export default function ({\n      request,\n      context,\n    }: {\n      request: Request;\n      context: RequestContext;\n    }) {\n      // Return an Astro.locals object with a title property\n      return {\n        title: \"Spider-man's blog\",\n      };\n    }\n    ```\n    \n\nAstro's middleware, which should be in `src/middleware.ts`, is distinct from Vercel Edge Middleware, which should be a `middleware.ts` file at the root of your project.\n\nVercel recommends using framework-native solutions. You should use Astro's middleware over Vercel's Edge Middleware wherever possible.\n\nIf you still want to use Vercel's Edge Middleware, see [the Quickstart](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/edge-middleware/quickstart) to learn how.\n\nRewrites only work for static files with Astro. You must use [Vercel's Edge Middleware](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/edge-middleware/middleware-api#match-paths-based-on-conditional-statements) for rewrites. You should not use `vercel.json` to rewrite URL paths with astro projects; doing so produces inconsistent behavior, and is not officially supported.\n\nIn general, Vercel recommends using framework-native solutions, and Astro has [built-in support for redirects](https://docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/routing/#redirects). That said, you can also do redirects with [Vercel's Edge Middleware](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/edge-middleware/quickstart).\n\nYou can do redirects on Astro with `astro.config.ts` the `redirects` config option as shown below:\n\n```\nimport { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';\n \nexport default defineConfig({\n  redirects: {\n    '/old-page': '/new-page',\n  },\n});\n```\n\nYou can also return a redirect from a Server Endpoint using the [`redirect`](https://docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/endpoints/#redirects) utility:\n\n```\nexport async function GET({ params, redirect }): APIRoute {\n  return redirect('/redirect-path', 307);\n}\n```\n\nYou can redirect from within Astro components with [`Astro.redirect()`](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/api-reference/#astroredirect):\n\n```\n---\nimport { isLoggedIn } from '../utils';\n \nconst cookie = Astro.request.headers.get('cookie');\n \n// If the user is not logged in, redirect them to the login page\nif (!isLoggedIn(cookie)) {\n  return Astro.redirect('/login');\n}\n---\n \n<h1>You can only see this page while logged in</h1>\n```\n\nAstro Middleware on Vercel:\n\n*   Executes before a request is processed on a site, allowing you to modify responses to user requests\n*   Runs on _all_ requests, but can be scoped to specific paths [through a `matcher` config](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/edge-middleware/middleware-api#match-paths-based-on-custom-matcher-config)\n*   Uses Vercel's lightweight Edge Runtime to keep costs low and responses fast\n\n[Learn more about Edge Middleware](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/edge-middleware)\n\nVercel automatically caches static files at the Edge after the first request, and stores them for up to 31 days on Vercel's Edge Network. Dynamic content can also be cached, and both dynamic and static caching behavior can be configured with [Cache-Control headers](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/headers#cache-control-header).\n\nThe following Astro component will show a new time every 10 seconds. It does by setting a 10 second max age on the contents of the page, then serving stale content while new content is being rendered on the server when that age is exceeded.\n\n[Learn more about Cache Control options](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/headers#cache-control-header).\n\n```\n---\nAstro.response.headers.set('Cache-Control', 's-maxage=10, stale-while-revalidate');\nconst time = new Date().toLocaleTimeString();\n---\n \n<h1>{time}</h1>\n```\n\nYou can also control how the cache behaves on any CDNs you may be using outside of Vercel's Edge Network with CDN Cache-Control Headers.\n\nThe following example tells downstream CDNs to cache the content for 60 seconds, and Vercel's Edge Network to cache it for 3600 seconds:\n\n```\n---\nAstro.response.headers.set('Vercel-CDN-Cache-Control', 'max-age=3600',);\nAstro.response.headers.set('CDN-Cache-Control', 'max-age=60',);\nconst time = new Date().toLocaleTimeString();\n---\n \n<h1>{time}</h1>\n```\n\n[Learn more about CDN Cache-Control headers](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/headers#cdn-cache-control-header).\n\nCaching on Vercel:\n\n*   Automatically optimizes and caches assets for the best performance\n*   Requires no additional services to procure or set up\n*   Supports zero-downtime rollouts\n\n[Vercel Speed Insights](https://vercel.com/docs/speed-insights) provides you with a detailed view of your website's performance metrics, facilitating informed decisions for its optimization. By [enabling Speed Insights](https://vercel.com/docs/speed-insights/quickstart), you gain access to the Speed Insights dashboard, which offers in-depth information about scores and individual metrics without the need for code modifications or leaving the dashboard.\n\nTo enable Speed Insights with Astro, see [the Speed Insights quickstart](https://vercel.com/docs/speed-insights/quickstart).\n\nTo summarize, using Speed Insights with Astro on Vercel:\n\n*   Enables you to track traffic performance metrics, such as [First Contentful Paint](https://vercel.com/docs/speed-insights#first-contentful-paint-fcp), or [First Input Delay](https://vercel.com/docs/speed-insights#first-input-delay-fid)\n*   Enables you to view performance metrics by page name and URL for more granular analysis\n*   Shows you [a score for your app's performance](https://vercel.com/docs/speed-insights#how-the-scores-are-determined) on each recorded metric, which you can use to track improvements or regressions\n\n[Learn more about Speed Insights](https://vercel.com/docs/speed-insights)\n\nSee [our Frameworks documentation page](https://vercel.com/docs/frameworks) to learn about the benefits available to all frameworks when you deploy on Vercel.\n\nLearn more about deploying Astro projects on Vercel with the following resources:",

To override this, you can export a `config` object in any route file.\n\nThe following is an example of a `svelte.config.js` file that will deploy using server-side rendering in Vercel's Node.js 18.x serverless runtime:\n\n```\nimport adapter from '@sveltejs/adapter-vercel';\n \n/** @type {import('@sveltejs/kit').Config} */\nconst config = {\n  kit: {\n    adapter: adapter({\n      runtime: 'nodejs18.x',\n    }),\n  },\n};\n \nexport default config;\n```\n\nYou can also configure how individual routes deploy by exporting a `config` object. The following is an example of a route that will deploy on Vercel's Edge runtime:\n\n```\nimport { PageServerLoad } from './$types';\n \nexport const config = {\n  runtime: 'edge',\n};\n \nexport const load = ({ cookies }): PageServerLoad<any> => {\n  // Load function code here\n};\n```\n\n[Learn about all the config options available in the SvelteKit docs](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapter-vercel#deployment-configuration). You can also see the type definitions for config object properties in [the SvelteKit source code](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/blob/master/packages/adapter-vercel/index.d.ts#L38).\n\nSvelteKit's docs have [a comprehensive list of all config options available to you](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapter-vercel#deployment-configuration). This section will cover a select few options which may be easier to use with more context.\n\nBy default, your SvelteKit routes get bundled into one Serverless or Edge Function when you deploy your project to Vercel. This configuration typically reduces how often your users encounter [cold starts](https://vercel.com/docs/infrastructure/compute#cold-and-hot-boots).\n\nIn most cases, there is no need to modify this option.\n\nSetting `split: true` in your Svelte config will cause your SvelteKit project's routes to get split into separate Edge or Serverless Functions.\n\nSplitting your Functions is not typically better than bundling them. You may want to consider setting `split: true` if you're experiencing either of the following issues:\n\n*   You have exceeded the Function size limit for the runtime you're using. Batching too many routes into a single Function could cause you to exceed Function size limits for your Vercel account. See our [Serverless Function size limits](https://vercel.com/docs/limits/overview#serverless-function-size) and [Edge Function size limits](https://vercel.com/docs/limits/overview#edge-middleware-and-edge-functions-size) to learn more.\n*   Your app is experiencing abnormally long cold start times. Batching Serverless Functions into one Function will reduce how often users experience cold starts. It can also increase the latency they experience when a cold start is required, since larger functions tend to require more resources. This can result in slower responses to user requests that occur after your Function spins down.\n\nYour SvelteKit routes get [deployed to Vercel's Node.js (Serverless) runtime](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/serverless-functions/runtimes/node-js) by default.\n\nYou can edit your config to deploy as Edge Functions instead by setting `runtime: 'edge'` in your config object.\n\nEdge and Serverless functions offer a cost-effective, scalable solution for serving personalized content to your visitors, both dynamically and statically.\n\n[See our Functions comparison table](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/serverless-functions/runtimes) to better understand which runtime you should choose.\n\nChoosing a region allows you to reduce latency for requests to Serverless and Edge routes. If you choose a Function region geographically near dependencies, or nearest to your visitor, you can reduce your Functions' latency.\n\nBy default, your Serverless Functions will be deployed in _Washington, D.C., USA_, or `iad1`. Adding a region ID to the `regions` array will deploy your Serverless Functions there. [See our Serverless Function regions docs to learn how to override this settings](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/serverless-functions/regions#select-a-default-serverless-region). Only Enterprise customers can deploy Serverless Functions to multiple regions.\n\nEdge Functions get deployed globally, and will invoke in the region nearest to each visitor by default. If your Edge Functions depend on data sources far from the user, this can add latency to the request.\n\nAdding [a valid region ID](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/regions) to your `regions` array will cause your Edge Function to always invoke in the specified region, preventing them from triggering far away from their dependencies. Support for multiple edge regions is in progress.\n\n[See our Edge Function regions docs to learn more](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/edge-functions).\n\nVercel supports streaming API responses over time with SvelteKit, allowing you to render parts of the UI early, then render the rest as data becomes available. Doing so lets users interact with your app before the full page loads, improving their perception of your app's speed. Here's how it works:\n\n*   SvelteKit enables you to use a `+page.server.ts` file to fetch data on the server, which you can access from a `+page.svelte` file located in the same folder\n*   You fetch data in a [`load`](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/load) function defined in `+page.server.ts`. This function returns an object\n    *   Top-level properties that return a promise will resolve before the page renders\n    *   Nested properties that return a promise [will stream](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/load#streaming-with-promises)\n\nThe following example demonstrates a `load` function that will stream its response to the client. To simulate delayed data returned from a promise, it uses a `sleep` method.\n\n```\nexport const config = {\n  // Use 'nodejs18.x' for Serverless\n  runtime: 'edge',\n};\nfunction sleep(value: any, ms: number) {\n  // Use this sleep function to simulate\n  // a delayed API response.\n  return new Promise((fulfill) => {\n    setTimeout(() => {\n      fulfill(value);\n    }, ms);\n  });\n}\nexport function load(event): PageServerLoad<any> {\n  // Get some location data about the visitor\n  const ip = event.getClientAddress();\n  const city = decodeURIComponent(\n    event.request.headers.get('x-vercel-ip-city') ?? 'unknown',\n  );\n  return {\n    topLevelExample: sleep({ data: \"This won't be streamed\" }, 2000)\n    // Stream the location data to the client\n    locationData: {\n      details: sleep({ ip, city }, 1000),\n    },\n  };\n}\n```\n\nYou could then display this data by creating the following `+page.svelte` file in the same directory:\n\n```\n<script lang=\"ts\">\n  import type { PageData } from './$types'\n  export let data: PageData;\n</script>\n \n<h1><span>Hello!</span></h1>\n \n<div class=\"info\">\n  {#await data.locationData.details}\n    <p>streaming delayed data from the server...</p>\n  {:then details}\n    <div>\n      <p>City is {details.city}</p>\n      <p>And IP is: {details.ip} </p>\n    </div>\n  {/await}\n</div>\n```\n\nTo summarize, Streaming with SvelteKit on Vercel:\n\n*   Enables you to stream UI elements as data loads\n*   Supports Edge and Serverless streaming\n*   Improves perceived speed of your app\n\n[Learn more about Streaming on Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/streaming).\n\nServer-Side Rendering (SSR) allows you to render pages dynamically on the server. This is useful for pages where the rendered data needs to be unique on every request. For example, verifying authentication or checking the geolocation of an incoming request.\n\nVercel offers SSR that scales down resource consumption when traffic is low, and scales up with traffic surges. This protects your site from accruing costs during periods of no traffic or losing business during high-traffic periods.\n\nSvelteKit projects are server-side rendered by default. You can configure individual routes to prerender with the `prerender` page option, or use the same option in your app's root `+layout.js` or `+layout.server.js` file to make all your routes prerendered by default.\n\nWhile server-side rendered SvelteKit apps do support middleware, SvelteKit does not support URL rewrites from middleware.\n\n[See the SvelteKit docs on prerendering to learn more](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/page-options#prerender).\n\nTo summarize, SSR with SvelteKit on Vercel:\n\n*   Scales to zero when not in use\n*   Scales automatically with traffic increases\n*   Has zero-configuration support for [`Cache-Control` headers](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/caching), including `stale-while-revalidate`\n*   Framework-aware infrastructure enables switching rendering between Edge/Node.js runtimes\n\n[Learn more about SSR](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/page-options#ssr)\n\nVercel provides a set of System Environment Variables that our platform automatically populates. For example, the `VERCEL_GIT_PROVIDER` variable exposes the Git provider that triggered your project's deployment on Vercel.\n\nThese environment variables will be available to your project automatically, and you can enable or disable them in your project settings on Vercel. [See our Environment Variables docs to learn how](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables/system-environment-variables).\n\nSvelteKit allows you to import environment variables, but separates them into different modules based on whether they're dynamic or static, and whether they're private or public. For example, the `'$env/static/private'` module exposes environment variables that don't change, and that you should not share publicly.\n\n[System Environment Variables](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables/system-environment-variables) are private and you should never expose them to the frontend client. This means you can only import them from `'$env/static/private'` or `'$env/dynamic/private'`.\n\nThe example below exposes `VERCEL_COMMIT_REF`, a variable that exposes the name of the branch associated with your project's deployment, to [a `load` function](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/load) for a Svelte layout:\n\n```\nimport { LayoutServerLoad } from './types';\nimport { VERCEL_COMMIT_REF } from '$env/static/private';\n \ntype DeploymentInfo = {\n  deploymentGitBranch: string;\n};\n \nexport function load(): LayoutServerLoad<DeploymentInfo> {\n  return {\n    deploymentGitBranch: 'Test',\n  };\n}\n```\n\nYou could reference that variable in [a corresponding layout](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/load#layout-data) as shown below:\n\n```\n<script>\n  /** @type {import('./$types').LayoutData} */\n  export let data;\n</script>\n \n<p>This staging environment was deployed from {data.deploymentGitBranch}.</p>\n```\n\nSvelteKit projects with `edge: true` enabled can only use Environment Variables listed in the `envVarsInUse` config property.\n\nTo summarize, the benefits of using Environment Variables with SvelteKit on Vercel include:\n\n*   Access to vercel deployment information, dynamically or statically, with our preconfigured System Environment Variables\n*   Access to automatically-configured environment variables provided by [integrations for your preferred services](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables#integration-environment-variables)\n*   Searching and filtering environment variables by name and environment in Vercel's dashboard\n\n[Learn more about Environment Variables](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables)\n\nIncremental Static Regeneration allows you to create or update content without redeploying your site. When you deploy a route with ISR, Vercel caches the page to serve it to visitors statically, and rebuilds it on a time interval of your choice. ISR has three main benefits for developers: better performance, improved security, and faster build times.\n\n[See our ISR docs to learn more](https://vercel.com/docs/incremental-static-regeneration).\n\nTo deploy a SvelteKit route with ISR:\n\n*   Export a `config` object with an `isr` property. Its value will be the number of seconds to wait before revalidating\n*   To enable on-demand revalidation, add the `bypassToken` property to the `config` object. Its value gets checked when `GET` or `HEAD` requests get sent to the route. If the request has a `x-prerender-revalidate` header with the same value as `bypassToken`, the cache will be revalidated immediately\n\nThe following example demonstrates a SvelteKit route that Vercel will deploy with ISR, revalidating the page every 60 seconds, with on-demand revalidation enabled:\n\n```\nexport const config = {\n  isr: {\n    expiration: 60,\n    bypassToken: 'REPLACE_ME_WITH_SECRET_VALUE',\n  },\n};\n```\n\n[Learn more about ISR with SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapter-vercel#incremental-static-regeneration).\n\nTo summarize, the benefits of using ISR with SvelteKit on Vercel include:\n\n*   Better performance with our global [Edge Network](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/overview)\n*   Zero-downtime rollouts to previously statically generated pages\n*   Framework-aware infrastructure enables global content updates in 300ms\n*   Generated pages are both cached and persisted to durable storage\n\n[Learn more about ISR](https://vercel.com/docs/incremental-static-regeneration)\n\nNew project deployments can lead to version skew. This can happen when your users are using your app and a new version gets deployed. Their deployment version requests assets from an older version. And those assets from the previous version got replaced. This can cause errors when those active users navigate or interact with your project.\n\nSvelteKit has a skew protection solution. When it detects version skew, it triggers a hard reload of a page to sync to the latest version. This does mean the client-side state gets lost. With Vercel skew protection, client requests get routed to their original deployment. No client-side state gets lost. To enable it, visit the Advanced section of your project settings on Vercel.\n\n[Learn more about skew protection with SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapter-vercel#skew-protection).\n\nTo summarize, the benefits of using ISR with SvelteKit on Vercel include:\n\n*   Mitigates the risk of your active users encountering version skew\n*   Avoids hard reloads for current active users on your project\n\n[Learn more about skew protection on Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/skew-protection).\n\n[Image Optimization](https://vercel.com/docs/image-optimization) helps you achieve faster page loads by reducing the size of images and using modern image formats.\n\nWhen deploying to Vercel, you can optimize your images on demand, keeping your build times fast while improving your page load performance and [Core Web Vitals](https://vercel.com/docs/speed-insights/metrics#core-web-vitals-explained).\n\nTo use Image Optimization with SvelteKit on Vercel, use the [`@sveltejs/adapter-vercel`](#use-vercel-features-with-svelte) within your `svelte.config.ts` file.\n\n```\nimport adapter from '@sveltejs/adapter-vercel';\n \nexport default {\n  kit: {\n    adapter({\n      images: {\n        sizes: [640, 828, 1200, 1920, 3840],\n        formats: ['image/avif', 'image/webp'],\n        minimumCacheTTL: 300,\n        domains: ['example-app.vercel.app'],\n      }\n    })\n  }\n};\n```\n\nThis allows you to specify [configuration options](https://vercel.com/docs/build-output-api/v3/configuration#images) for Vercel's native image optimization API.\n\nTo use image optimization with SvelteKit, you have to construct your own `srcset` URLs. You can create a library function that will optimize `srcset` URLs in production for you like this:\n\n```\nimport { dev } from '$app/environment';\n \nexport function optimize(src: string, widths = [640, 960, 1280], quality = 90) {\n  if (dev) return src;\n \n  return widths\n    .slice()\n    .sort((a, b) => a - b)\n    .map((width, i) => {\n      const url = `/_vercel/image?url=${encodeURIComponent(src)}&w=${width}&q=${quality}`;\n      const descriptor = i < widths.length - 1 ? ` ${width}w` : '';\n      return url + descriptor;\n    })\n    .join(', ');\n}\n```\n\nUse an `img` or any other image component with an optimized `srcset` generated by the `optimize` function:\n\n```\n<script lang=\"ts\">\n  import { optimize } from '$lib/image';\n  import type { Photo } from '$lib/types';\n \n  export let photo: Photo;\n</script>\n \n<img\n  class=\"absolute left-0 top-0 w-full h-full\"\n  srcset={optimize(photo.url)}\n  alt={photo.description}\n/>\n```\n\nTo summarize, using Image Optimization with SvelteKit on Vercel:\n\n*   Configure image optimization with `@sveltejs/adapter-vercel`\n*   Optimize for production with a function that constructs optimized `srcset` for your images\n*   Helps your team ensure great performance by default\n*   Keeps your builds fast by optimizing images on-demand\n\n[Learn more about Image Optimization](https://vercel.com/docs/image-optimization)\n\nVercel's Web Analytics features enable you to visualize and monitor your application's performance over time. The Analytics tab in your project's dashboard offers detailed insights into your website's visitors, with metrics like top pages, top referrers, and user demographics.\n\nTo use Web Analytics, navigate to the Analytics tab of your project dashboard on Vercel and select Enable in the modal that appears.\n\nTo track visitors and page views, we recommend first installing our `@vercel/analytics` package by running the terminal command below in the root directory of your SvelteKit project:\n\nIn your SvelteKit project's main `+layout.svelte` file, add the following `<script>`:\n\nWith the above script added to your project, you'll be able to view detailed user insights in your dashboard on Vercel under the Analytics tab. [See our docs to learn more about the user metrics you can track with Vercel's Web Analytics](https://vercel.com/docs/analytics).\n\nYour project must be deployed on Vercel to take advantage of the Web Analytics feature. Work on making this feature more broadly available is in progress.\n\nTo summarize, using Web Analytics with SvelteKit on Vercel:\n\n*   Enables you to track traffic and see your top-performing pages\n*   Offers you detailed breakdowns of visitor demographics, including their OS, browser, geolocation, and more\n\n[Learn more about Web Analytics](https://vercel.com/docs/analytics)\n\nYou can see data about your project's [Core Web Vitals](https://vercel.com/docs/speed-insights#core-web-vitals-explained) performance in your dashboard on Vercel. Doing so will allow you to track your web application's loading speed, responsiveness, and visual stability so you can improve the user experience.\n\n[See our Speed Insights docs to learn more](https://vercel.com/docs/speed-insights).\n\nTo summarize, using Speed Insights with SvelteKit on Vercel:\n\n*   Enables you to track traffic performance metrics, such as [First Contentful Paint](https://vercel.com/docs/speed-insights#first-contentful-paint-fcp), or [First Input Delay](https://vercel.com/docs/speed-insights#first-input-delay-fid)\n*   Enables you to view performance metrics by page name and URL for more granular analysis\n*   Shows you [a score for your app's performance](https://vercel.com/docs/speed-insights#how-the-scores-are-determined) on each recorded metric, which you can use to track improvements or regressions\n\n[Learn more about Speed Insights](https://vercel.com/docs/speed-insights)\n\n[Draft Mode](https://vercel.com/docs/workflow-collaboration/draft-mode) enables you to view draft content from your [Headless CMS](https://vercel.com/docs/solutions/cms) immediately, while still statically generating pages in production.\n\nTo use a SvelteKit route in Draft Mode, you must:\n\n1.  Export a `config` object [that enables Incremental Static Regeneration](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapter-vercel#incremental-static-regeneration) from the route's `+page.server` file:\n\n```\nimport { BYPASS_TOKEN } from '$env/static/private';\n \nexport const config = {\n  isr: {\n    // Random token that can be provided to bypass the cached version of the page with a __prerender_bypass=<token> cookie. Allows rendering content at request time for this route.\n    bypassToken: BYPASS_TOKEN,\n \n    // Expiration time (in seconds) before the cached asset will be re-generated by invoking the Serverless Function.\n    // Setting the value to `false` means it will never expire.\n    expiration: 60,\n  },\n};\n```\n\n2.  Send a `__prerender_bypass` cookie with the same value as `bypassToken` in your config.\n\nTo render the draft content, SvelteKit will check for `__prerender_bypass`. If its value matches the value of `bypassToken`, it will render content fetched at request time rather than prebuilt content.\n\nWe recommend using a cryptographically secure random number generator at build time as your `bypassToken` value. If a malicious actor guesses your `bypassToken`, they can view your pages in Draft Mode.\n\nDeployments on Vercel automatically secure Draft Mode behind the same authentication used for Preview Comments. In order to enable or disable Draft Mode, the viewer must be logged in as a member of the [Team](https://vercel.com/docs/teams-and-accounts). Once enabled, Vercel's Edge Network will bypass the ISR cache automatically and invoke the underlying [Serverless Function](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/serverless-functions).\n\nYou and your team members can toggle Draft Mode in the Vercel Toolbar in [production](https://vercel.com/docs/workflow-collaboration/comments/in-production-and-localhost#using-@vercel/toolbar-in-production), [localhost](https://vercel.com/docs/workflow-collaboration/comments/in-production-and-localhost#using-@vercel/toolbar-in-localhost), and [Preview Deployments](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/preview-deployments#comments). When you do so, the toolbar will become purple to indicate Draft Mode is active.\n\n![The Vercel toolbar when Draft Mode is enabled.](https://vercel.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.vercel.com%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1689795055%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Fworkflow-collaboration%2Fdraft-mode%2Fdraft-toolbar1-light.png&w=828&q=75&dpl=dpl_6RGLzPaeBNhuWHRxN1xTYtAhKUa3)![The Vercel toolbar when Draft Mode is enabled.](https://vercel.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.vercel.com%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1689795055%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Fworkflow-collaboration%2Fdraft-mode%2Fdraft-toolbar1-dark.png&w=828&q=75&dpl=dpl_6RGLzPaeBNhuWHRxN1xTYtAhKUa3)\n\nThe Vercel toolbar when Draft Mode is enabled.\n\nUsers outside your Vercel team cannot toggle Draft Mode.\n\nTo summarize, the benefits of using Draft Mode with SvelteKit on Vercel include:\n\n*   Easily server-render previews of static pages\n*   Adds security measures to prevent malicious usage\n*   Integrates with any headless provider of your choice\n*   You can enable and disable Draft Mode in [the comments toolbar](https://vercel.com/docs/workflow-collaboration/comments/how-comments-work) on Preview Deployments\n\n[Learn more about Draft Mode](https://vercel.com/docs/workflow-collaboration/draft-mode)\n\nEdge Middleware is useful for modifying responses before they're sent to a user. We recommend [using SvelteKit's server hooks](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/hooks) to modify responses. Due to SvelteKit's client-side rendering, you cannot use Vercel's Edge Middleware with SvelteKit.\n\nAdding a [`vercel.json`](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/project-configuration) file to the root directory of your project enables you to rewrite your app's routes.\n\nWe do not recommend using `vercel.json` rewrites with SvelteKit.\n\nRewrites from `vercel.json` only apply to the Vercel proxy. At runtime, SvelteKit doesn't have access to the rewritten URL, which means it has no way of rendering the intended rewritten route.\n\nSee [our Frameworks documentation page](https://vercel.com/docs/frameworks) to learn about the benefits available to all frameworks when you deploy on Vercel.\n\nLearn more about deploying SvelteKit projects on Vercel with the following resources:",

    "markdown": "# Nuxt on Vercel\n\nNuxt is an open-source framework that streamlines the process of creating modern Vue apps. It offers server-side rendering, SEO features, automatic code splitting, prerendering, and more out of the box. It also has [an extensive catalog of community-built modules](https://nuxt.com/modules), which allow you to integrate popular tools with your projects.\n\nYou can deploy Nuxt static and server-side rendered sites on Vercel with no configuration required.\n\nTo get started with Nuxt on Vercel:\n\n*   If you already have a project with Nuxt, install [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/docs/cli) and run the `vercel` command from your project's root directory\n*   Clone one of our Nuxt example repos to your favorite git provider and deploy it on Vercel with the button below:\n\nVercel deployments can [integrate with your git provider](https://vercel.com/docs/git) to [generate preview URLs](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/preview-deployments) for each pull request you make to your Nuxt project.\n\nThe following table outlines the differences between `nuxt build` and `nuxt generate` on Vercel:\n\n| Feature | `nuxt build` | `nuxt generate` |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Default build command | Yes | No  |\n| Supports all Vercel features out of the box | Yes | No, [must set `nitro.static` to `true`](#static-rendering) |\n| [Supports SSR](#server-side-rendering-ssr) | Yes | No  |\n| [Supports SSG](#static-rendering) | Yes, [with nuxt config](#static-rendering) | Yes |\n| [Supports ISR](#incremental-static-regeneration-isr) | Yes | No  |\n\nIn general, `nuxt build` is likely best for most use cases. Consider using `nuxt generate` to build [fully static sites](#static-rendering).\n\nYou can configure your Nuxt deployment by creating a Nuxt config file in your project's root directory. It can be a TypeScript, JavaScript, or MJS file, but [the Nuxt team recommends using TypeScript](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/configuration#nuxt-configuration). Using TypeScript will allow your editor to suggest the correct names for configuration options, which can help mitigate typos.\n\nYour Nuxt config file should default export `defineNuxtConfig` by default, which you can add an options object to.\n\nThe following is an example of a Nuxt config file with no options defined:\n\n```\nexport default defineNuxtConfig({\n  // Config options here\n});\n```\n\n[See the Nuxt Configuration Reference docs for a list of available options](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/configuration/nuxt-config/#nuxt-configuration-reference).\n\nWith the `routeRules` config option, you can:\n\n*   Create redirects\n*   Modify a route's response headers\n*   Enable ISR\n*   Deploy specific routes statically\n*   Deploy specific routes with SSR\n*   and more\n\nAt the moment, there is no way to configure route deployment options within your page components, but development of this feature is in progress.\n\nThe following is an example of a Nuxt config that:\n\n*   Creates a redirect\n*   Modifies a route's response headers\n*   Opts a set of routes into client-side rendering\n\n```\nexport default defineNuxtConfig({\n  routeRules: {\n    '/examples/*': { redirect: '/redirect-route' },\n    '/modify-headers-route': { headers: { 'x-magic-of': 'nuxt and vercel' } },\n    // Enables client-side rendering\n    '/spa': { ssr: false },\n  },\n});\n```\n\nTo learn more about `routeRules`:\n\n[Serverless Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/serverless-functions) enable developers to write functions that uses resources that scale up and down based on traffic demands. This prevents them from failing during peak hours, but keeps them from running up high costs during periods of low activity.\n\nNuxt deploys routes defined in `/server/api`, `/server/routes`, and `/server/middleware` as one server-rendered Serverless Function by default. Nuxt Pages, APIs, and Middleware routes get bundled into a single Vercel Function.\n\nThe following is an example of a basic API Route in Nuxt:\n\n```\nexport default defineEventHandler(() => 'Hello World!');\n```\n\nYou can test your API Routes with `nuxt dev`.\n\n[Edge Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/edge-functions) are a fast, scalable solution for delivering dynamic content to users. By default, Edge Functions get deployed globally, and invoked in one of Vercel's [Edge regions](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/regions) near your site's visitors.\n\nTo use Edge Functions with Nuxt SSR routes on Vercel, you can:\n\n*   Create a `NITRO_PRESET` environment variable and set its value to `vercel-edge`\n*   Or add `nitro: { preset: 'vercel-edge' }` to your `nuxt.config.ts`:\n    \n    ```\n    export default defineNuxtConfig({\n      nitro: {\n        preset: 'vercel-edge',\n      },\n    });\n    ```\n    \n\nYou cannot enable Edge Functions for individual routes.\n\nThe Nuxt team [recommends](https://nitro.unjs.io/deploy/#changing-the-deployment-preset) using environment variables for deployments depending on CI/CD. You can set environment variables in your project's dashboard on Vercel under Settings ➞ Environment Variables. See [Declaring Environment Variables](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables#declare-an-environment-variable) to learn more.\n\nYou can specify which regions your Edge Functions should get invoked in with your `nuxt.config.ts`:\n\n```\nexport default defineNuxtConfig({\n  nitro: {\n    preset: 'vercel-edge',\n    vercel: {\n      regions: ['iad1'],\n    },\n  },\n});\n```\n\n[See our runtime comparison table to understand whether Edge or Serverless is best for your use-case](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/serverless-functions/runtimes).\n\nYou can read and write server files with Nuxt on Vercel. One way to do this is by using Nitro with Vercel Functions and the [Vercel KV driver](https://unstorage.unjs.io/drivers/vercel). Use Nitro's [server assets](https://nitro.unjs.io/guide/assets#server-assets) to include files in your project deployment. Assets within `server/assets` get included by default.\n\nTo access server assets, you can use Nitro's [storage API](https://nitro.unjs.io/guide/storage):\n\n```\nexport default defineEventHandler(async () => {\n  // https://nitro.unjs.io/guide/assets#server-assets\n  const assets = useStorage('assets:server');\n  const users = await assets.getItem('users.json');\n  return {\n    users,\n  };\n});\n```\n\nTo write files, mount [KV storage](https://nitro.unjs.io/guide/storage) with the [Vercel KV driver](https://unstorage.unjs.io/drivers/vercel):\n\nUpdate your `nuxt.config.ts` file.\n\n```\nexport default defineNuxtConfig({\n  $production: {\n    nitro: {\n      storage: {\n        data: { driver: 'vercelKV' },\n      },\n    },\n  },\n});\n```\n\nUse with the storage API.\n\n```\nexport default defineEventHandler(async (event) => {\n  const dataStorage = useStorage('data');\n  await dataStorage.setItem('hello', 'world');\n  return {\n    hello: await dataStorage.getItem('hello'),\n  };\n});\n```\n\n[See an example code repository](https://github.com/pi0/nuxt-server-assets/tree/main).\n\nMiddleware is code that executes before a request gets processed. Because Middleware runs before the cache, it's an effective way of providing personalization to statically generated content.\n\nNuxt has two forms of Middleware:\n\n*   [Server middleware](#nuxt-server-middleware-on-vercel)\n*   [Route middleware](#nuxt-route-middleware-on-vercel)\n\nIn Nuxt, modules defined in `/server/middleware` will get deployed as [server middleware](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/server#server-middleware). Server middleware should not have a return statement or send a response to the request.\n\nServer middleware is best used to read data from or add data to a request's `context`. Doing so allows you to handle authentication or check a request's params, headers, url, [and more](https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/obj_http_incomingmessage.asp).\n\nThe following example demonstrates Middleware that:\n\n*   Checks for a cookie\n*   Tries to fetch user data from a database based on the request\n*   Adds the user's data and the cookie data to the request's context\n\n```\nimport { getUserFromDBbyCookie } from 'some-orm-package';\n \nexport default defineEventHandler(async (event) => {\n  // The getCookie method is available to all\n  // Nuxt routes by default. No need to import.\n  const token = getCookie(event, 'session_token');\n \n  // getUserFromDBbyCookie is a placeholder\n  // made up for this example. You can fetch\n  // data from wherever you want here\n  const { user } = await getUserFromDBbyCookie(event.request);\n \n  if (user) {\n    event.context.user = user;\n    event.context.session_token = token;\n  }\n});\n```\n\nYou could then access that data in a page on the frontend with the [`useRequestEvent`](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/composables/use-request-event) hook. This hook is only available in routes deployed with SSR. If your page renders in the browser, `useRequestEvent` will return `undefined`.\n\nThe following example demonstrates a page fetching data with `useRequestEvent`:\n\n```\n<script>\n  const event = useRequestEvent();\n  const user = ref(event.context?.user);\n</script>\n \n<template>\n    <div v-if=\"user\">\n      <h1>Hello, {{ user.name }}!</h1>\n    </div>\n    <div v-else>\n      <p>Authentication failed!</p>\n    </div>\n</template>\n```\n\nNuxt's route middleware runs before navigating to a particular route. While server middleware runs in Nuxt's [Nitro engine](https://nitro.unjs.io/), route middleware runs in Vue.\n\nRoute middleware is best used when you want to do things that server middleware can't, such as redirecting users, or preventing them from navigating to a route.\n\nThe following example demonstrates route middleware that redirects users to a secret route:\n\n```\nexport default defineNuxtRouteMiddleware((to) => {\n  console.log(\n    `Heading to ${to.path} - but I think we should go somewhere else...`,\n  );\n \n  return navigateTo('/secret');\n});\n```\n\nBy default, route middleware code will only run on pages that specify them. To do so, within the `<script>` tag for a page, you must call the `definePageMeta` method, passing an object with `middleware: 'middleware-filename'` set as an option.\n\nThe following example demonstrates a page that runs the above redirect middleware:\n\n```\n<script>\ndefinePageMeta({\n  middleware: 'redirect'\n})\n</script>\n \n<template>\n  <div>\n    You should never see this page\n  </div>\n</template>\n```\n\nTo make a middleware global, add the `.global` suffix before the file extension. The following is an example of a basic global middleware file:\n\n```\nexport default defineNuxtRouteMiddleware(() => {\n  console.log('running global middleware');\n});\n```\n\n[See a detailed example of route middleware in Nuxt's Middleware example docs](https://nuxt.com/docs/examples/routing/middleware).\n\nMiddleware with Nuxt on Vercel enables you to:\n\n*   Redirect users, and prevent navigation to routes\n*   Run authentication checks on the server, and pass results to the frontend\n*   Scope middleware to specific routes, or run it on all routes\n\n[Learn more about Middleware](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/middleware)\n\nServer-Side Rendering (SSR) allows you to render pages dynamically on the server. This is useful for pages where the rendered data needs to be unique on every request. For example, checking authentication or looking at the location of an incoming request.\n\nNuxt allows you to deploy your projects with a strategy called [Universal Rendering](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/concepts/rendering#universal-rendering). In concrete terms, this allows you to deploy your routes with SSR by default and opt specific routes out [in your Nuxt config](#editing-your-nuxt-config).\n\nWhen you deploy your app with Universal Rendering, it renders on the server once, then your client-side JavaScript code gets interpreted in the browser again once the page loads.\n\nOn Vercel, Nuxt apps are server-rendered by default\n\nSSR with Nuxt on Vercel:\n\n*   Scales to zero when not in use\n*   Scales automatically with traffic increases\n*   Allows you to opt individual routes out of SSR [with your Nuxt config](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/deployment#client-side-only-rendering)\n\n[Learn more about SSR](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/concepts/rendering#universal-rendering)\n\nIf you deploy with `nuxt build`, you can opt nuxt routes into client-side rendering using `routeRules` by setting `ssr: false` as demonstrated below:\n\n```\nexport default defineNuxtConfig({\n  routeRules: {\n    // Use client-side rendering for this route\n    '/client-side-route-example': { ssr: false },\n  },\n});\n```\n\nTo deploy a fully static site on Vercel, build your project with `nuxt generate`. You should set `nitro.static` to `true` to enable Vercel features such as redirects, [Image Optimization](#image-optimization), and more when using `nuxt generate`:\n\n```\nexport default defineNuxtConfig({\n  nitro: {\n    static: true,\n  },\n});\n```\n\nIf you deploy with `nuxt build`, You can statically generate Nuxt routes at build time using the `prerender` option in your `nuxt.config.ts`:\n\n```\nexport default defineNuxtConfig({\n  routeRules: {\n    // prerender index route by default\n    '/': { prerender: true },\n    // prerender this route and all child routes\n    '/prerender-multiple/**': { prerender: true },\n  },\n});\n```\n\n[Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)](https://vercel.com/docs/incremental-static-regeneration) allows you to create or update content _without_ redeploying your site. ISR has two main benefits for developers: better performance and faster build times.\n\nTo enable ISR in a Nuxt route, add a `routeRules` option to your `nuxt.config.ts`, as shown in the example below:\n\n```\nexport default defineNuxtConfig({\n  routeRules: {\n    // all routes (by default) will be revalidated every 60 seconds, in the background\n    '/**': { isr: 60 },\n    // this page will be generated on demand and then cached permanently\n    '/static': { isr: true },\n    // this page is statically generated at build time and cached permanently\n    '/prerendered': { prerender: true },\n    // this page will be always fresh\n    '/dynamic': { isr: false },\n  },\n});\n```\n\nYou should use the `isr` option rather than `swr` to enable ISR in a route. The `isr` option enables Nuxt to use Vercel's Edge Cache.\n\nusing ISR with Nuxt on Vercel offers:\n\n*   Better performance with our global [Edge Network](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/overview)\n*   Zero-downtime rollouts to previously statically generated pages\n*   Global content updates in 300ms\n*   Generated pages are both cached and persisted to durable storage\n\n[Learn more about ISR with Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/concepts/rendering#hybrid-rendering).\n\nYou can define redirects and response headers with Nuxt on Vercel in your `nuxt.config.ts`:\n\n```\nexport default defineNuxtConfig({\n  routeRules: {\n    '/examples/*': { redirect: '/redirect-route' },\n    '/modify-headers-route': { headers: { 'x-magic-of': 'nuxt and vercel' } },\n  },\n});\n```\n\n[Image Optimization](https://vercel.com/docs/image-optimization) helps you achieve faster page loads by reducing the size of images and using modern image formats.\n\nWhen deploying to Vercel, images are automatically optimized on demand, keeping your build times fast while improving your page load performance and [Core Web Vitals](https://vercel.com/docs/speed-insights).\n\nTo use Image Optimization with Nuxt on Vercel, follow [the Image Optimization quickstart](https://vercel.com/docs/image-optimization/quickstart) by selecting Nuxt from the dropdown.\n\nUsing Image Optimization with Nuxt on Vercel:\n\n*   Requires zero-configuration for Image Optimization when using `nuxt/image`\n*   Helps your team ensure great performance by default\n*   Keeps your builds fast by optimizing images on-demand\n\n[Learn more about Image Optimization](https://vercel.com/docs/image-optimization)\n\nDynamic social card images allow you to create a unique image for pages of your site. This is great for sharing links on the web through social platforms or text messages.\n\nTo generate dynamic social card images for Nuxt projects, you can use [`nuxt-og-image`](https://nuxtseo.com/og-image/getting-started/installation). It uses the main Nuxt/Nitro [Server-side rendering(SSR)](#server-side-rendering-ssr) function.\n\nThe following example demonstrates using Open Graph (OG) image generation with [`nuxt-og-image`](https://nuxtseo.com/og-image/getting-started/installation):\n\n1.  Create a new OG template\n\n```\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\n  withDefaults(defineProps<{\n    title?: string\n  }>(), {\n    title: 'title',\n  })\n</script>\n<template>\n  <div class=\"h-full w-full flex items-start justify-start border-solid border-blue-500 border-[12px] bg-gray-50\">\n    <div class=\"flex items-start justify-start h-full\">\n      <div class=\"flex flex-col justify-between w-full h-full\">\n        <h1 class=\"text-[80px] p-20 font-black text-left\">\n          {{ title }}\n        </h1>\n        <p class=\"text-2xl pb-10 px-20 font-bold mb-0\">\n          acme.com\n        </p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</template>\n```\n\n2.  Use that OG image in your pages. Props passed get used in your open graph images.\n\n```\n<script lang=\"ts\" setup>\ndefineOgImageComponent('Template', {\n  title: 'Is this thing on?'\n})\n</script>\n```\n\nTo see your generated image, run your project and use Nuxt DevTools. Or you can visit the image at its URL `/__og-image__/image/og.png`.\n\n[Learn more about OG Image Generation with Nuxt](https://nuxtseo.com/og-image/getting-started/installation).\n\nThe Nuxt team [does not recommend deploying legacy versions of Nuxt (such as Nuxt 2) on Vercel](https://github.com/nuxt/vercel-builder#readme), except as static sites. If your project uses a legacy version of Nuxt, you should either:\n\nIf you still want to use legacy Nuxt versions with Vercel, you should only do so by building a static site with `nuxt generate`. We do not recommend deploying legacy Nuxt projects with server-side rendering.\n\nSee [our Frameworks documentation page](https://vercel.com/docs/frameworks) to learn about the benefits available to all frameworks when you deploy on Vercel.\n\nLearn more about deploying Nuxt projects on Vercel with the following resources:",

    "markdown": "# Remix on Vercel\n\nRemix is a fullstack, [server-rendered](#server-side-rendering-ssr) React framework. Its built-in features for nested pages, error boundaries, transitions between loading states, and more, enable developers to create modern web apps.\n\nWith Vercel, you can deploy server-rendered Remix and Remix V2 applications to Vercel with zero configuration. When using the [Remix Vite plugin](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/future/vite), static site generation using [SPA mode](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/future/spa-mode) is also supported.\n\nIt is highly recommended that your application uses the Remix Vite plugin, in conjunction with the [Vercel Preset](#vercel-vite-preset), when deploying to Vercel.\n\nTo get started with Remix on Vercel:\n\n*   If you already have a project with Remix, install [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/docs/cli) and run the `vercel` command from your project's root directory\n*   Clone one of our Remix example repos to your favorite git provider and deploy it on Vercel with the button below:\n\nVercel deployments can [integrate with your git provider](https://vercel.com/docs/git) to [generate preview URLs](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/preview-deployments) for each pull request you make to your Remix project.\n\nThe [`@vercel/remix`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vercel/remix) package exposes useful types and utilities for Remix apps deployed on Vercel, such as:\n\nTo best experience Vercel features such as [streaming](#streaming), [Edge Functions](#edge-functions), [Serverless Functions](#serverless-functions), and more, we recommend importing utilities from `@vercel/remix` rather than from standard Remix packages such as `@remix-run/node`.\n\n`@vercel/remix` should be used anywhere in your code that you normally would import utility functions from the following packages:\n\nTo get started, navigate to the root directory of your Remix project with your terminal and install `@vercel/remix` with your preferred package manager:\n\nWhen using the [Remix Vite plugin](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/future/vite) (highly recommended), you should configure the Vercel Preset to enable the full feature set that Vercel offers.\n\nTo configure the Preset, add the following lines to your `vite.config` file:\n\n```\nimport { vitePlugin as remix } from '@remix-run/dev';\nimport { installGlobals } from '@remix-run/node';\nimport { defineConfig } from 'vite';\nimport tsconfigPaths from 'vite-tsconfig-paths';\nimport { vercelPreset } from '@vercel/remix/vite';\n \ninstallGlobals();\n \nexport default defineConfig({\n  plugins: [\n    remix({\n      presets: [vercelPreset()],\n    }),\n    tsconfigPaths(),\n  ],\n});\n```\n\nUsing this Preset enables Vercel-specific functionality such as rendering your Remix application using either Node.js or Edge runtimes.\n\nServer-Side Rendering (SSR) allows you to render pages dynamically on the server. This is useful for pages where the rendered data needs to be unique on every request. For example, checking authentication or looking at the location of an incoming request.\n\nRemix routes defined in `app/routes` are deployed with server-side rendering by default.\n\nThe following example demonstrates a basic route that renders with SSR:\n\n```\nexport default function IndexRoute() {\n  return (\n    <div style={{ fontFamily: 'system-ui, sans-serif', lineHeight: '1.4' }}>\n      <h1>This route is rendered on the server</h1>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nWith Vercel, there are two ways to deploy your server rendered routes:\n\n*   [Serverless Functions](#serverless-functions) (default)\n*   [Edge Functions](#edge-functions)\n\nThe runtime which is used to render your route can be configured on a per-route basis. See below for examples of how to configure your routes.\n\nSee [our Function comparison table](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/serverless-functions/runtimes) to understand whether Edge or Serverless is best for your use-case.\n\nServerless Functions execute using Node.js. They enable developers to write functions that use resources that scale up and down based on traffic demands. This prevents them from failing during peak hours, but keeps them from running up high costs during periods of low activity.\n\nRemix API routes in `app/routes` are deployed as Serverless Functions by default. To learn how to deploy them as Edge Functions instead, [see our section on Edge Functions](#edge-functions).\n\nThe following example demonstrates a basic route that renders a page with the heading, \"Welcome to Remix with Vercel (Serverless)\":\n\n```\nexport default function Serverless() {\n  return <h1>Welcome to Remix with Vercel (Serverless)</h1>;\n}\n```\n\nTo [configure](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/configuring-functions) Serverless Functions on a per-route basis, export a `config` object in the route.\n\nFor example, to configure the [maximum duration of your function](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/configuring-functions/duration), you can use the following configuration:\n\n```\n// This function can run for a maximum of 5 seconds\nexport const config = {\n  maxDuration: 5,\n};\n \nexport default function Serverless() {\n  return <h1>Welcome to Remix with Vercel (Serverless)</h1>;\n}\n```\n\nConfiguration can also be specified in a layout route, and all routes that use that layout will _inherit_ the parent configuration.\n\nFor example, to configure _all_ routes to use a common configuration, export the `config` object in the `app/root` layout:\n\n```\nimport { Outlet } from '@remix-run/react';\n \n// All routes will inherit this configuration,\n// unless a route overrides the config option\nexport const config = {\n  memory: 1024,\n};\n \nexport default function App() {\n  return <Outlet />;\n}\n```\n\nTo summarize, Server-Side Rendering (SSR) with Remix on Vercel:\n\n*   Scales to zero when not in use\n*   Scales automatically with traffic increases\n*   Has framework-aware infrastructure that enables switching rendering between Edge/Node.js (Serverless) runtimes\n\nEdge Functions are a fast and reliable solution for delivering dynamic content to users. By default, Edge Functions deploy globally and will be invoked in one of Vercel's [Edge regions](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/regions) near your site's visitors.\n\nEdge Functions are ideal when you need to interact with data over the network as fast as possible, such as executing OAuth callbacks, responding to webhook requests, or interacting with an API that fails if a request is not completed within a short time limit.\n\nRemix routes defined in `app/routes` are deployed as Serverless Functions by default. To deploy a route with Edge Functions, you must export a `config` object with `runtime: 'edge'`. For example:\n\n```\n// This route will be rendered using the Edge runtime\nexport const config = { runtime: 'edge' };\n \nexport default function Edge() {\n  return <h1>Welcome to Remix@Edge</h1>;\n}\n```\n\nRoutes inherit the configuration defined in their parent layout route. Therefore, if you would like to for all routes, or a group of routes, to be rendered using the Edge runtime, you can define the configuration in a parent layout route.\n\n```\nimport { Outlet } from '@remix-run/react';\n \n// All routes will be rendered using Edge runtime\nexport const config = { runtime: 'edge' };\n \nexport default function App() {\n  return <Outlet />;\n}\n```\n\nWhen a layout is configured to render using Edge, you can configure a route to use Node.js by exporting a config object with `runtime: 'nodejs'`.\n\nThe following example demonstrates a parent `admin` layout deployed on the Edge Runtime that renders a list of blog posts for an admin user.\n\n```\nimport { Link, Outlet, useLoaderData } from '@remix-run/react';\nimport type { LoaderFunctionArgs } from '@vercel/remix';\nimport { json } from '@vercel/remix';\nimport { getPostListings } from '~/models/post.server';\nimport { requireAdminUser } from '~/session.server';\n \nexport const config = { runtime: 'edge' };\n \nexport async function loader({ request }: LoaderFunctionArgs) {\n  await requireAdminUser(request);\n  return json({ posts: await getPostListings() });\n}\n \nexport default function AdminPostList() {\n  const { posts } = useLoaderData<typeof loader>();\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Blog Admin</h1>\n      <nav>\n        <ul>\n          {posts.map((post) => (\n            <li key={post.slug}>\n              <Link to={post.slug}>{post.title}</Link>\n            </li>\n          ))}\n        </ul>\n      </nav>\n      <main>\n        <Outlet />\n      </main>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nThen, create a nested `$slug` file under `/app/routes/posts/admin/`. This route will deploy as a Vercel Serverless Function:\n\n```\nimport { json } from '@vercel/remix';\nimport type { LoaderFunctionArgs } from '@vercel/remix';\nimport { getPost } from '~/models/post.server';\nimport { requireAdminUser } from '~/session.server';\n \nexport const config = { runtime: 'nodejs' };\n \nexport async function loader({ request, params }: LoaderFunctionArgs) {\n  // Authenticate the user\n  await requireAdminUser(request);\n  // Fetch the post\n  const post = await getPost(params.slug);\n  // Add it to the loader data, which\n  // the component can use\n  return json({ post });\n}\n \nexport default function Post() {\n  const { post } = useLoaderData<typeof loader>();\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <p>{post.title}</p>\n      <p>{post.description}</p>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nIf the parent layout route is _not_ explicitly defined as an Edge Function, that route and its nested routes will deploy as Serverless Functions. In such cases, exporting a `config` object with `runtime: 'nodejs'` is not necessary.\n\nTo summarize, Edge Functions with Remix on Vercel:\n\n*   Offer cost savings by using fewer resources than Serverless Functions\n*   Can execute in the region nearest to your users or nearest to data sources they depend on, based on your configuration\n*   Have access to the geolocation and IP address of visitors, enabling location-based personalization\n\n[Learn more about Edge Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/edge-functions)\n\n[Streaming HTTP responses](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/overview#streaming) with Remix on Vercel is supported, in both Edge and Serverless routes. See the [Streaming](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/guides/streaming) page in the Remix docs for general instructions.\n\nThe following example demonstrates a route that simulates a throttled network by delaying a promise's result, and renders a loading state until the promise is resolved:\n\n```\nimport { Suspense } from 'react';\nimport { Await, useLoaderData } from '@remix-run/react';\nimport { defer } from '@vercel/remix';\n \nfunction sleep(ms: number) {\n  return new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, ms));\n}\n \nexport async function loader({ request }) {\n  const version = process.versions.node;\n \n  return defer({\n    // Don't let the promise resolve for 1 second\n    version: sleep(1000).then(() => version),\n  });\n}\n \nexport default function DeferredRoute() {\n  const { version } = useLoaderData();\n \n  return (\n    <Suspense fallback={'Loading…'}>\n      <Await resolve={version}>{(version) => <strong>{version}</strong>}</Await>\n    </Suspense>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nTo summarize, Streaming with Remix on Vercel:\n\n*   Offers faster Function response times, improving your app's user experience\n*   Allows you to return large amounts of data without exceeding Edge and Serverless Function response size limits\n*   Allows you to display Instant Loading UI from the server with Remix's `defer()` and `Await`\n\n[Learn more about Streaming](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/streaming)\n\nVercel's [Edge Network](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/overview) caches your content at the edge in order to serve data to your users as fast as possible. [Static caching](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/caching#static-files-caching) works with zero configuration.\n\nBy adding a `Cache-Control` header to responses returned by your Remix routes, you can specify a set of caching rules for both client (browser) requests and server responses. A cache must obey the requirements defined in the Cache-Control header.\n\nRemix supports header modifications with the [`headers`](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/route/headers) function, which you can export in your routes defined in `app/routes`.\n\nThe following example demonstrates a route that adds `Cache Control` headers which instruct the route to:\n\n*   Return cached content for requests repeated within 1 second without revalidating the content\n*   For requests repeated after 1 second, but before 60 seconds have passed, return the cached content and mark it as stale. The stale content will be revalidated in the background with a fresh value from your [`loader`](https://remix.run/docs/en/1.14.0/route/loader) function\n\n```\nimport type { HeadersFunction } from '@vercel/remix';\n \nexport const headers: HeadersFunction = () => ({\n  'Cache-Control': 's-maxage=1, stale-while-revalidate=59',\n});\n \nexport async function loader() {\n  // Fetch data necessary to render content\n}\n```\n\nSee [our docs on cache limits](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/caching#limits) to learn the max size and lifetime of caches stored on Vercel.\n\nTo summarize, using `Cache-Control` headers with Remix on Vercel:\n\n*   Allow you to cache responses for server-rendered Remix apps using Edge or Serverless Functions\n*   Allow you to serve content from the cache _while updating the cache in the background_ with `stale-while-revalidate`\n\n[Learn more about Caching](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/caching#how-to-cache-responses)\n\nVercel's Analytics features enable you to visualize and monitor your application's performance over time. The Analytics tab in your project's dashboard offers detailed insights into your website's visitors, with metrics like top pages, top referrers, and user demographics.\n\nTo use Analytics, navigate to the Analytics tab of your project dashboard on Vercel and select Enable in the modal that appears.\n\nTo track visitors and page views, we recommend first installing our `@vercel/analytics` package by running the terminal command below in the root directory of your Remix project:\n\nThen, follow the instructions below to add the `Analytics` component to your app. The `Analytics` component is a wrapper around Vercel's tracking script, offering a seamless integration with Remix.\n\nAdd the following component to your `root` file:\n\n```\nimport { Analytics } from '@vercel/analytics/react';\n \nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n      <body>\n        <Analytics />\n      </body>\n    </html>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nTo summarize, Analytics with Remix on Vercel:\n\n*   Enables you to track traffic and see your top-performing pages\n*   Offers you detailed breakdowns of visitor demographics, including their OS, browser, geolocation and more\n\n[Learn more about Analytics](https://vercel.com/docs/analytics)\n\nBy default, Vercel supplies an implementation of the `entry.server` file which is configured for streaming to work on both Edge and Serverless runtimes. This version will be used when no `entry.server` file is found in the project, or when the existing `entry.server` file has not been modified from the base Remix template.\n\nHowever, if your application requires a customized `app/entry.server.jsx` or `app/entry.server.tsx` file (for example, to wrap the `<RemixServer>` component with a React context), you should base it off of this template:\n\n```\nimport { RemixServer } from '@remix-run/react';\nimport { handleRequest, type EntryContext } from '@vercel/remix';\n \nexport default async function (\n  request: Request,\n  responseStatusCode: number,\n  responseHeaders: Headers,\n  remixContext: EntryContext,\n) {\n  let remixServer = <RemixServer context={remixContext} url={request.url} />;\n  return handleRequest(\n    request,\n    responseStatusCode,\n    responseHeaders,\n    remixServer,\n  );\n}\n```\n\nDefining a custom `server` file is not supported when using the Remix Vite plugin on Vercel.\n\nIt's usually not necessary to define a custom server.js file within your Remix application when deploying to Vercel. In general, we do not recommend it.\n\nIf your project requires a custom [`server`](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/file-conventions/remix-config#md-server) file, you will need to [install `@vercel/remix`](#@vercel/remix) and import `createRequestHandler` from `@vercel/remix/server`. The following example demonstrates a basic `server.js` file:\n\n```\nimport { createRequestHandler } from '@vercel/remix/server';\nimport * as build from '@remix-run/dev/server-build';\n \nexport default createRequestHandler({\n  build,\n  mode: process.env.NODE_ENV,\n  getLoadContext() {\n    return {\n      nodeLoadContext: true,\n    };\n  },\n});\n```\n\nSee [our Frameworks documentation page](https://vercel.com/docs/frameworks) to learn about the benefits available to all frameworks when you deploy on Vercel.\n\nLearn more about deploying Remix projects on Vercel with the following resources:",

    "markdown": "# Gatsby on Vercel\n\nGatsby is an open-source static-site generator. It enables developers to build fast and secure websites that integrate different content, APIs, and services.\n\nGatsby also has a large ecosystem of plugins and tools that improve the development experience. Vercel supports many Gatsby features, including [Server-Side Rendering](#server-side-rendering), [Deferred Static Generation](#deferred-static-generation), [API Routes](#api-routes), and more.\n\nTo get started with Gatsby on Vercel:\n\n*   If you already have a project with Gatsby, install [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/docs/cli) and run the `vercel` command from your project's root directory\n*   Clone one of our Gatsby example repos to your favorite git provider and deploy it on Vercel with the button below:\n\nVercel deployments can [integrate with your git provider](https://vercel.com/docs/git) to [generate preview URLs](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/preview-deployments) for each pull request you make to your Gatsby project.\n\n[Gatsby v4+](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/gatsby-4/) sites deployed to Vercel will automatically detect Gatsby usage and install the `@vercel/gatsby-plugin-vercel-builder` plugin.\n\nTo deploy your Gatsby site to Vercel, do not install the `@vercel/gatsby-plugin-vercel-builder` plugin yourself, or add it to your `gatsby-config.js` file.\n\n[Gatsby v5](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/gatsby-5/) sites require Node.js 18, which is currently the default version used for new Vercel builds.\n\nVercel persists your Gatsby project's `.cache` directory across builds.\n\nServer-Side Rendering (SSR) allows you to render pages dynamically on the server. This is useful for pages where the rendered data needs to be unique on every request. For example, verifying authentication or checking the geolocation of an incoming request.\n\nVercel offers SSR that scales down resource consumption when traffic is low, and scales up with traffic surges. This protects your site from accruing costs during periods of no traffic or losing business during high-traffic periods.\n\nYou can server-render pages in your Gatsby application on Vercel [using Gatsby's native Server-Side Rendering API](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/rendering-options/server-side-rendering/). These pages will be deployed to Vercel as [Serverless Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/serverless-functions).\n\nTo server-render a Gatsby page, you must export an `async` function called `getServerData`. The function can return an object with several optional keys, [as listed in the Gatsby docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/rendering-options/server-side-rendering/#creating-server-rendered-pages). The `props` key will be available in your page's props in the `serverData` property.\n\nThe following example demonstrates a server-rendered Gatsby page using `getServerData`:\n\n```\nimport type { GetServerDataProps, GetServerDataReturn } from 'gatsby';\n \ntype ServerDataProps = {\n  hello: string;\n};\n \nconst Page = (props: PageProps) => {\n  const { name } = props.serverData;\n  return <div>Hello, {name}</div>;\n};\n \nexport async function getServerData(\n  props: GetServerDataProps,\n): GetServerDataReturn<ServerDataProps> {\n  try {\n    const res = await fetch(`https://example-data-source.com/api/some-data`);\n    return {\n      props: await res.json(),\n    };\n  } catch (error) {\n    return {\n      status: 500,\n      headers: {},\n      props: {},\n    };\n  }\n}\n \nexport default Page;\n```\n\nTo summarize, SSR with Gatsby on Vercel:\n\n*   Scales to zero when not in use\n*   Scales automatically with traffic increases\n*   Has zero-configuration support for [`Cache-Control` headers](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/caching), including `stale-while-revalidate`\n*   Framework-aware infrastructure enables switching rendering between Edge/Node.js runtimes\n\n[Learn more about SSR](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/rendering-options/using-server-side-rendering/)\n\nDeferred Static Generation (DSG) allows you to defer the generation of static pages until they are requested for the first time.\n\nTo use DSG, you must set the `defer` option to `true` in the `createPages()` function in your `gatsby-node` file.\n\n```\nimport type { GatsbyNode } from 'gatsby';\n \nexport const createPages: GatsbyNode['createPages'] = async ({ actions }) => {\n  const { createPage } = actions;\n  createPage({\n    defer: true,\n    path: '/using-dsg',\n    component: require.resolve('./src/templates/using-dsg.js'),\n    context: {},\n  });\n};\n```\n\n[See the Gatsby docs on DSG to learn more](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/rendering-options/using-deferred-static-generation/#introduction).\n\nTo summarize, DSG with Gatsby on Vercel:\n\n*   Allows you to defer non-critical page generation to user request, speeding up build times\n*   Works out of the box when you deploy on Vercel\n*   Can yield dramatic speed increases for large sites with content that is infrequently visited\n\n[Learn more about DSG](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/rendering-options/using-deferred-static-generation/)\n\nGatsby supports [Deferred Static Generation](#deferred-static-generation).\n\nThe static rendered fallback pages are not generated at build time. This differentiates it from incremental static regeneration (ISR). Instead, a Vercel Function gets invoked upon page request. And the resulting response gets cached for 10 minutes. This is hard-coded and currently not configurable.\n\nSee the documentation for [Deferred Static Generation](#deferred-static-generation).\n\nYou can add API Routes to your Gatsby site using the framework's native support for the `src/api` directory. Doing so will deploy your routes as [Serverless Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/serverless-functions). These Serverless Functions can be used to fetch data from external sources, or to add custom endpoints to your application.\n\nThe following example demonstrates a basic API Route using Serverless Functions:\n\n```\nimport type { VercelRequest, VercelResponse } from '@vercel/node';\n \nexport default function handler(\n  request: VercelRequest,\n  response: VercelResponse,\n) {\n  response.status(200).json({\n    body: request.body,\n    query: request.query,\n    cookies: request.cookies,\n  });\n}\n```\n\nTo view your route locally, run the following command in your terminal:\n\nThen navigate to `http://localhost:8000/api/handler` in your web browser.\n\nVercel does not currently have first-class support for dynamic API routes in Gatsby. For now, using them requires the workaround described in this section.\n\nTo use Gatsby's Dynamic API routes on Vercel, you must:\n\n1.  Define your dynamic routes in a `vercel.json` file at the root directory of your project, as shown below:\n    \n    ```\n    {\n      \"rewrites\": [\n        {\n          \"source\": \"/api/blog/:id\",\n          \"destination\": \"/api/blog/[id]\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n    ```\n    \n2.  Read your dynamic parameters from `req.query`, as shown below:\n    \n    ```\n    import type { VercelRequest, VercelResponse } from '@vercel/node';\n     \n    export default function handler(\n      request: VercelRequest & { params: { id: string } },\n      response: VercelResponse,\n    ) {\n      console.log(`/api/blog/${request.query.id}`);\n      response.status(200).json({\n        body: request.body,\n        query: request.query,\n        cookies: request.cookies,\n      });\n    }\n    ```\n    \n\nAlthough typically you'd access the dynamic parameter with `request.param` when using Gatsby, you must use `request.query` on Vercel.\n\nSplat API routes are dynamic wildcard routes that will match anything after the splat (`[...]`). Vercel does not currently have first-class support for splat API routes in Gatsby. For now, using them requires the workaround described in this section.\n\nTo use Gatsby's splat API routes on Vercel, you must:\n\n1.  Define your splat routes in a `vercel.json` file at the root directory of your project, as shown below:\n    \n    ```\n    {\n      \"rewrites\": [\n        {\n          \"source\": \"/api/products/:path*\",\n          \"destination\": \"/api/products/[...]\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n    ```\n    \n2.  Read your dynamic parameters from `req.query.path`, as shown below:\n    \n    ```\n    import type { VercelRequest, VercelResponse } from '@vercel/node';\n     \n    export default function handler(\n      request: VercelRequest & { params: { path: string } },\n      response: VercelResponse,\n    ) {\n      console.log(`/api/products/${request.query.path}`);\n      response.status(200).json({\n        body: request.body,\n        query: request.query,\n        cookies: request.cookies,\n      });\n    }\n    ```\n    \n\nTo summarize, API Routes with Gatsby on Vercel:\n\n*   Scale to zero when not in use\n*   Scale automatically with traffic increases\n*   Can be tested as Serverless Functions in your local environment\n\n[Learn more about Gatsby API Routes](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/routing/creating-routes/)\n\nGatsby does not have native support for [Edge Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/edge-functions).\n\nTo use Edge Functions in your Gatsby project on Vercel, you must create an `api` directory at the root of your project. Note that this is different from the `src/api/` directory, which is where Vercel detects and deploys Serverless Functions.\n\nThe following example demonstrates a basic Edge Function:\n\n```\nexport const config = {\n  runtime: 'edge',\n};\n \nexport default (request: Request) => {\n  return new Response(`Hello, from ${request.url} I'm now an Edge Function!`);\n};\n```\n\n[See our Function comparison table to understand whether Edge or Serverless is best for your use-case](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/edge-functions).\n\nTo summarize, Edge Functions with Gatsby on Vercel:\n\n*   Enable you to respond to user requests with dynamic content at low latency, at scale\n*   Offer cost savings by using fewer resources than Serverless Functions\n*   Can execute in the region nearest to your users or nearest to data sources they depend on, based on your configuration\n*   Have access to the geolocation and IP address of visitors, enabling location-based personalization\n\n[Learn more about Edge Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/edge-functions)\n\nGatsby does not have native framework support for using [Edge Middleware](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/edge-middleware).\n\nHowever, you can still use Edge Middleware with your Gatsby site by creating a `middeware.js` or `middeware.ts` file in your project's root directory.\n\nThe following example demonstrates middleware that adds security headers to responses sent to users who visit the `/example` route in your Gatsby application:\n\n```\nimport { next } from '@vercel/edge';\n \nexport const config = {\n  // Only run the middleware on the example route\n  matcher: '/example',\n};\n \nexport default function middleware(request: Request): Response {\n  return next({\n    headers: {\n      'Referrer-Policy': 'origin-when-cross-origin',\n      'X-Frame-Options': 'DENY',\n      'X-Content-Type-Options': 'nosniff',\n      'X-DNS-Prefetch-Control': 'on',\n      'Strict-Transport-Security':\n        'max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload',\n    },\n  });\n}\n```\n\nTo summarize, Edge Middleware with Gatsby on Vercel:\n\n*   Executes before a request is processed on a site, allowing you to modify responses to user requests\n*   Runs on _all_ requests, but can be scoped to specific paths [through a `matcher` config](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/edge-middleware/middleware-api#match-paths-based-on-custom-matcher-config)\n*   Uses our lightweight Edge Runtime to keep costs low and responses fast\n\n[Learn more about Edge Middleware](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/edge-middleware)\n\n[Core Web Vitals](https://vercel.com/docs/speed-insights) are supported for Gatsby v4+ projects with no initial configuration necessary.\n\nWhen you deploy a Gatsby v4+ site on Vercel, we automatically install the `@vercel/gatsby-plugin-vercel-analytics` package and add it to the `plugins` array in your `gatsby-config.js` file.\n\nWe do not recommend installing the Gatsby analytics plugin yourself.\n\nTo access your Core Web Vitals data, you must enable Vercel analytics in your project's dashboard. [See our quickstart guide to do so now](https://vercel.com/docs/analytics/quickstart).\n\nTo summarize, using Speed Insights with Gatsby on Vercel:\n\n*   Enables you to track traffic performance metrics, such as [First Contentful Paint](https://vercel.com/docs/speed-insights#first-contentful-paint-fcp), or [First Input Delay](https://vercel.com/docs/speed-insights#first-input-delay-fid)\n*   Enables you to view performance analytics by page name and URL for more granular analysis\n*   Shows you [a score for your app's performance](https://vercel.com/docs/speed-insights#how-the-scores-are-determined) on each recorded metric, which you can use to track improvements or regressions\n\n[Learn more about Speed Insights](https://vercel.com/docs/speed-insights)\n\nWhile Gatsby [does provide an Image plugin](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-image), it is not currently compatible with Vercel Image Optimization.\n\nIf this is something your team is interested in, [please contact our sales team](https://vercel.com/contact/sales).\n\n[Learn more about Image Optimization](https://vercel.com/docs/image-optimization)\n\nSee [our Frameworks documentation page](https://vercel.com/docs/frameworks) to learn about the benefits available to all frameworks when you deploy on Vercel.\n\nLearn more about deploying Gatsby projects on Vercel with the following resources:",

    "markdown": "# Vite on Vercel\n\nVite is an opinionated build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects. Vite provides a dev server with rich feature enhancements such as pre-bundling NPM dependencies and hot module replacement, and a build command that bundles your code and outputs optimized static assets for production.\n\nThese features make Vite more desirable than out-of-the-box CLIs when building larger projects with frameworks for many developers.\n\nVite powers popular frameworks like [SvelteKit](https://vercel.com/docs/frameworks/sveltekit), and is often used in large projects built with [Vue](https://vercel.com/guides/deploying-vuejs-to-vercel), [Svelte](https://vercel.com/docs/frameworks/sveltekit), [React](https://vercel.com/docs/frameworks/create-react-app), [Preact](https://vercel.com/guides/deploying-preact-with-vercel), [and more](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite).\n\nTo get started with Vite on Vercel:\n\n*   If you already have a project with Vite, install [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/docs/cli) and run the `vercel` command from your project's root directory\n*   Clone one of our Vite example repos to your favorite git provider and deploy it on Vercel with the button below:\n\nVercel deployments can [integrate with your git provider](https://vercel.com/docs/git) to [generate preview URLs](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/preview-deployments) for each pull request you make to your Vite project.\n\nAlthough Vite offers modern features like [SSR](#server-side-rendering-ssr) and [Serverless Functions](#serverless-functions) out of the box, implementing those features can sometimes require complex configuration steps. Because of this, many Vite users prefer to use [popular community plugins](https://github.com/vitejs/awesome-vite#readme).\n\nVite's plugins are based on [Rollup's plugin interface](https://rollupjs.org/javascript-api/), giving Vite users access to [many tools from the Rollup ecosystem](https://vite-rollup-plugins.patak.dev/) as well as the [Vite-specific ecosystem](https://github.com/vitejs/awesome-vite#readme).\n\nWe recommend using popular Vite plugins to configure your project when possible.\n\n[`vite-plugin-vercel`](https://github.com/magne4000/vite-plugin-vercel#readme) is a popular community Vite plugin that implements [the Build Output API spec](https://vercel.com/docs/build-output-api/v3). It enables your Vite apps to use the following Vercel features:\n\n[`vite-plugin-ssr`](https://vite-plugin-ssr.com/) is another popular community Vite plugin that implements [the Build Output API spec](https://vercel.com/docs/build-output-api/v3). It enables your Vite apps to do the following:\n\n*   [Server-Side Rendering (SSR)](#server-side-rendering-ssr)\n*   [Serverless Functions](#serverless-functions)\n*   [Edge Functions](#edge-functions)\n*   [Static Site Generation](https://vercel.com/docs/build-output-api/v3/primitives#static-files)\n\nVercel provides a set of [System Environment Variables](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables/system-environment-variables) that our platform automatically populates. For example, the `VERCEL_GIT_PROVIDER` variable exposes the Git provider that triggered your project's deployment on Vercel.\n\nThese environment variables will be available to your project automatically, and you can enable or disable them in your project settings on Vercel. See [our Environment Variables docs](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables) to learn how.\n\nTo access Vercel's System Environment Variables in Vite during the build process, prefix the variable name with `VITE`. For example, `VITE_VERCEL_ENV` will return `preview`, `production`, or `development` depending on which environment the app is running in.\n\nThe following example demonstrates a Vite config file that sets `VITE_VERCEL_ENV` as a global constant available throughout the app:\n\n```\nexport default defineConfig(() => {\n  return {\n    define: {\n      __APP_ENV__: process.env.VITE_VERCEL_ENV,\n    },\n  };\n});\n```\n\nIf you want to read environment variables from a `.env` file, additional configuration is required. See [the Vite config docs](https://vitejs.dev/config/#using-environment-variables-in-config) to learn more.\n\nTo summarize, the benefits of using System Environment Variables with Vite on Vercel include:\n\n*   Access to Vercel deployment information, dynamically or statically, with our preconfigured System Environment Variables\n*   Access to automatically-configured environment variables provided by [integrations for your preferred services](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables#integration-environment-variables)\n*   Searching and filtering environment variables by name and environment in Vercel's dashboard\n\n[Learn more about System Environment Variables](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables/system-environment-variables)\n\nEdge Functions are a fast, scalable solution for delivering dynamic content to users. By default, Edge Functions are deployed globally, and will be invoked in one of Vercel's datacenters near your site's visitors.\n\nEdge Functions are ideal when you need to interact with data over the network as fast as possible, such as executing OAuth callbacks, responding to webhook requests, or interacting with an API that fails if a request is not completed within a short time limit.\n\nIf your project uses [a Vite community plugin](#using-vite-community-plugins), such as [`vite-plugin-ssr`](https://vite-plugin-ssr.com/), you should follow that plugin's documentation for using Edge Functions.\n\nIf you're using a framework built on Vite, check that framework's official documentation or [our dedicated framework docs](https://vercel.com/docs/frameworks). Some frameworks built on Vite, such as [SvelteKit](https://vercel.com/docs/frameworks/sveltekit), support Edge Functions natively. We recommend using that framework's method for implementing Edge Functions.\n\nIf you're not using a framework or plugin that supports Edge Functions, you can still use them in your project by creating route modules in an `api` directory at the root of your project.\n\nThe following example demonstrates a basic `api/handler` Edge Function route:\n\n```\nexport const config = {\n  runtime: 'edge',\n};\n \nexport default (request: Request) => {\n  return new Response(`Hello, from ${request.url} I'm now an Edge Function!`);\n};\n```\n\nYou can test your Edge Function routes locally using [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/docs/cli) with the `vercel dev` command.\n\nSee our [Function comparison table](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/serverless-functions/runtimes) to understand whether Edge or Serverless is best for your use-case.\n\nTo summarize, Edge Functions with Vite on Vercel:\n\n*   Offer cost savings by using fewer resources than Serverless Functions\n*   Can execute in the region nearest to your users or nearest to data sources they depend on, based on your configuration\n*   Have access to the geolocation and IP address of visitors, enabling location-based personalization\n\n[Learn more about Edge Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/edge-functions)\n\nServerless Functions scale up and down their resource consumption based on traffic demands. This scaling prevents them from failing during peak hours, but keeps them from running up high costs during periods of low activity.\n\nIf your project uses [a Vite community plugin](#using-vite-community-plugins), such as [`vite-plugin-ssr`](https://vite-plugin-ssr.com/), you should follow that plugin's documentation for using Serverless Functions.\n\nIf you're using a framework built on Vite, check that framework's official documentation or [our dedicated framework docs](https://vercel.com/docs/frameworks). Some frameworks built on Vite, such as [SvelteKit](https://vercel.com/docs/frameworks/sveltekit), support Serverless Functions natively. We recommend using that framework's method for implementing Serverless Functions.\n\nIf you're not using a framework or plugin that supports Serverless Functions, you can still use them in your project by creating routes in an `api` directory at the root of your project.\n\nSee [our Edge Functions section](#edge-functions) to learn how to deploy your routes as Edge Functions instead.\n\nThe following example demonstrates a basic Serverless Function defined in an `api` directory:\n\n```\nimport type { VercelRequest, VercelResponse } from '@vercel/node';\n \nexport default function handler(\n  request: VercelRequest,\n  response: VercelResponse,\n) {\n  response.status(200).json({\n    body: request.body,\n    query: request.query,\n    cookies: request.cookies,\n  });\n}\n```\n\nSee our [Function comparison table](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/serverless-functions/runtimes) to understand whether Edge or Serverless is best for your use-case.\n\nTo summarize, Serverless Functions on Vercel:\n\n*   Scales to zero when not in use\n*   Scales automatically with traffic increases\n*   Support standard [Web APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API), such as `URLPattern`, `Response`, and more\n\n[Learn more about Serverless Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/serverless-functions)\n\nServer-Side Rendering (SSR) allows you to render pages dynamically on the server. This is useful for pages where the rendered data needs to be unique on every request. For example, checking authentication or looking at the location of an incoming request.\n\nVite exposes [a low-level API for implementing SSR](https://vitejs.dev/guide/ssr.html#server-side-rendering), but in most cases, we recommend [using a Vite community plugin](#using-vite-community-plugins).\n\nSee [the SSR section of Vite's plugin repo](https://github.com/vitejs/awesome-vite#ssr) for a more comprehensive list of SSR plugins.\n\nTo summarize, SSR with Vite on Vercel:\n\n*   Scales to zero when not in use\n*   Scales automatically with traffic increases\n*   Has zero-configuration support for [`Cache-Control`](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/caching) headers, including `stale-while-revalidate`\n\n[Learn more about SSR](https://vitejs.dev/guide/ssr.html)\n\nIf your Vite app is [configured to deploy as a Single Page Application (SPA)](https://vitejs.dev/config/shared-options.html#apptype), deep linking won't work out of the box.\n\nTo enable deep linking in SPA Vite apps, create a `vercel.json` file at the root of your project, and add the following code:\n\n```\n{\n  \"rewrites\": [\n    {\n      \"source\": \"/(.*)\",\n      \"destination\": \"/index.html\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nDeploying your app in Multi-Page App mode is recommended for production builds.\n\nLearn more about [Mutli-Page App mode](https://vitejs.dev/guide/build.html#multi-page-app) in the Vite docs.\n\nSee [our Frameworks documentation page](https://vercel.com/docs/frameworks) to learn about the benefits available to all frameworks when you deploy on Vercel.\n\nLearn more about deploying Vite projects on Vercel with the following resources:",

    "markdown": "# Choosing a Runtime\n\nVercel supports multiple runtimes for your functions. Each runtime has its own set of libraries, APIs, and functionality that provides different trade-offs and benefits.\n\nRuntimes transform your source code into [Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/functions), which are served by our [Edge Network](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/overview).\n\nRuntime configuration is usually only necessary when you want to use the Edge runtime.\n\nVercel supports these official runtimes:\n\n| Runtime | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Node.js](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/runtimes/node-js) | The Node.js runtime takes an entrypoint of a Node.js function, builds its dependencies (if any) and bundles them into a Serverless Function. |\n| [Edge](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/edge-functions/edge-runtime) | The Edge runtime is a lightweight JavaScript runtime that exposes a set of Web Standard APIs that make sense on the server. |\n| [Go](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/runtimes/go) | The Go runtime takes in a Go program that defines a singular HTTP handler and outputs it as a Serverless Function. |\n| [Python](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/runtimes/python) | The Python runtime takes in a Python program that defines a singular HTTP handler and outputs it as a Serverless Function. |\n| [Ruby](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/runtimes/ruby) | The Ruby runtime takes in a Ruby program that defines a singular HTTP handler and outputs it as a Serverless Function. |\n\nIf you would like to use a language that Vercel does not support by default, you can use a community runtime by setting the [`functions` property](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/project-configuration#functions) in `vercel.json`. For more information on configuring other runtimes, see [Configuring your function runtime](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/configuring-functions/runtime#other-runtimes).\n\nThe following community runtimes are recommended by Vercel:\n\nYou can create a community runtime by using the [Runtime API](https://github.com/vercel/vercel/blob/main/DEVELOPING_A_RUNTIME.md). Alternatively, you can use the [Build Output API](https://vercel.com/docs/build-output-api/v3).\n\nA runtime can retain an archive of up to 100 MB of the filesystem at build time. The cache key is generated as a combination of:\n\n*   Project name\n*   [Team ID](https://vercel.com/docs/accounts/create-a-team#find-your-team-id) or User ID\n*   Entrypoint path (e.g., `api/users/index.go`)\n*   Runtime identifier including version (e.g.: `@vercel/go@0.0.1`)\n\nThe cache will be invalidated if any of those items changes. You can bypass the cache by running `vercel -f`.\n\nWhen using functions on Vercel, you can choose what runtime you want to use:\n\n*   [Node.js (Serverless)](#node.js)\n*   [Edge](#edge)\n*   [Go, Python, Ruby](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/runtimes) - These runtimes are available in Beta for use with [Serverless Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/functions).\n\nUsually, when writing TypeScript or JavaScript functions, you'll be deciding between the Node.js or Edge runtime. The following sections provide information on the trade-offs and benefits of each.\n\n[Node.js](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/runtimes/node-js)\\-powered functions are suited to computationally intense or large functions and provide benefits like:\n\n*   More RAM and CPU power – For computationally intense workloads, or functions that have bundles up to 250 MB in size, this runtime is ideal\n*   Complete Node.js compatibility - The Node.js runtime offers access to all Node.js APIs, making it a powerful tool for many applications, although it may take them longer to boot than those using the Edge runtime\n\nIn our documentation and this guide, we mention **Serverless Functions**. These are [Node.js](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/runtimes/node-js) \\-powered Vercel Functions. To learn how to implement these functions, see the [quickstart](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/quickstart) .\n\n[Edge runtime](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/edge-functions/edge-runtime)\\-powered functions can be a cost-effective option and provide benefits like:\n\n*   Lightweight with a slim runtime - With a smaller API surface area and using V8 isolates, Edge runtime-powered functions have a slim runtime. However, only a subset of Node.js APIs are exposed\n*   Globally distributed by default – Vercel deploys all Edge Functions globally across its Edge Network, which means your site's visitors will get API responses from data centers geographically near them, typically reducing the overall response time\n*   Pricing is based on compute time – You're charged for time processing any requests and not for your function is fetching data. This is ideal for querying databases or AI services that may have longer request times\n\nResponses from Edge Functions can be _cached_ and _streamed_ in real time.\n\nIn our documentation and this guide, we mention **Edge Functions**. These are [Edge runtime](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/edge-functions/edge-runtime) \\-powered Vercel Functions. To learn how to implement these functions, see the [quickstart](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/edge-functions/quickstart) .\n\nRuntime is the environment in which your functions execute. Vercel supports [several runtimes](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/runtimes) for Serverless Functions ([Node.js](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/runtimes/node-js), [Go](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/runtimes/go), [Ruby](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/runtimes/ruby), [Python](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/runtimes/python)), while Edge Functions use the lightweight [Edge](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/edge-functions/edge-runtime) runtime.\n\nThis means that with Serverless Functions you have access to all Node.js APIs. With Edge Functions you get access to a subset of the most important browser APIs.\n\nLocation refers to where your functions are executed. Serverless Functions are region-first, while Edge Functions are executed close to the end-users across Vercel's global network.\n\nWhen you deploy Edge Functions, there are considerations you need to make about where it's deployed and executes. Edge Functions are executed globally and in a region close to the user's request. However, if your [data source](https://vercel.com/docs/storage#locate-your-data-close-to-your-functions) is geographically far from this request, any response will be slow. Because of this you can opt to [execute your function closer to your data source](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/configuring-functions/region).\n\nUsers on Enterprise plans can [deploy Serverless Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/configuring-functions/region#set-multiple-regions) to multiple regions. On non-Enterprise plans, deploying to multiple regions will fail before entering the [build step](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/configure-a-build). Users on any plan can deploy Edge Functions to multiple regions.\n\nVercel's [failover mode](https://vercel.com/docs/security#failover-strategy) refers to the system's behavior when a function fails to execute because of data center downtime.\n\nVercel provides [redundancy](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/regions#outage-resiliency) and automatic failover for Edge Functions to ensure high availability. For Serverless Functions, you can use the [`functionFailoverRegions` configuration](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/project-configuration#functionfailoverregions) in your `vercel.json` file to specify which regions the function should automatically failover to.\n\nThe concurrency model on Vercel refers to how many instances of your [functions](https://vercel.com/docs/functions) can run simultaneously. All functions on Vercel scale automatically based on demand to manage increased traffic loads.\n\nWith automatic concurrency scaling, your Vercel Functions can scale to a maximum of 30,000 on Pro or 100,000 on Enterprise, maintaining optimal performance during traffic surges. The scaling is based on the [burst concurrency limit](#burst-concurrency-limits) of 1000 concurrent executions per 10 seconds, per region. Additionally, Enterprise customers can purchase extended concurrency.\n\nVercel's infrastructure monitors your usage and preemptively adjusts the concurrency limit to cater to growing traffic, allowing your applications to scale without your intervention.\n\nAutomatic concurrency scaling is available on [all plans](https://vercel.com/docs/accounts/plans).\n\nBurst concurrency refers to Vercel's ability to temporarily handle a sudden influx of traffic by allowing a higher concurrency limit.\n\nUpon detecting a traffic spike, Vercel temporarily increases the concurrency limit to accommodate the additional load. The initial increase allows for a maximum of 1000 concurrent executions per 10 seconds. After the traffic burst subsides, the concurrency limit gradually returns to its previous state, ensuring a smooth scaling experience.\n\nThe scaling process may take several minutes during traffic surges, especially substantial ones. While this delay aligns with natural traffic curves to minimize potential impact on your application's performance, it's advisable to monitor the scaling process for optimal operation.\n\nYou can monitor burst concurrency events using [Log Drains](https://vercel.com/docs/observability/log-drains), or [Runtime Logs](https://vercel.com/docs/observability/runtime-logs) to help you understand and optimize your application's performance.\n\nIf you exceed the limit, a [`429 FUNCTION_RATE_LIMIT`](https://vercel.com/docs/errors/FUNCTION_RATE_LIMIT) error will trigger. Alternatively, you can explore [Edge Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/runtimes#edge), which do not have concurrency limits.\n\nIn Vercel, the isolation boundary refers to the separation of individual instances of a function to ensure they don't interfere with each other. This provides a secure execution environment for each function.\n\nWith traditional serverless infrastructure, each function uses a microVM for isolation, which provides strong security but also makes them slower to start and more resource intensive. As the Edge runtime is built on the [V8 engine](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/v8-runtime), it uses V8 isolates to separate just the runtime context, allowing for quick startup times and high performance.\n\nFilesystem support refers to a function's ability to read and write to the filesystem. Serverless Functions have a read-only filesystem with writable `/tmp` scratch space up to 500 MB. Edge Functions do not have filesystem access due to their ephemeral nature.\n\nServerless Functions are archived when they are not invoked:\n\nArchived functions will be unarchived when they're invoked, which can make the initial [cold start](https://vercel.com/docs/infrastructure/compute#cold-and-hot-boots) time at least 1 second longer than usual.\n\nEdge Functions are not archived.\n\nWhen using [Next.js](https://vercel.com/docs/frameworks/nextjs) or [SvelteKit](https://vercel.com/docs/frameworks/sveltekit) on Vercel, dynamic code (APIs, server-rendered pages, or dynamic `fetch` requests) will be bundled into the fewest number of Serverless Functions possible, to help reduce cold starts. Because of this, it's unlikely that you'll hit the limit of 12 bundled Serverless Functions per deployment.\n\nWhen using other [frameworks](https://vercel.com/docs/frameworks), or Serverless Functions [directly without a framework](https://vercel.com/docs/functions), every API maps directly to one Serverless Function. For example, having five files inside `api/` would create five Serverless Functions. For Hobby, this approach is limited to 12 Serverless Functions per deployment.\n\n|     | Node.js runtime (and more) | Edge runtime |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| [Max size](#bundle-size-limits) | 250 MB | Hobby: 1 MB, Pro: 2 MB, Ent: 4 MB |\n| [Max duration](#max-duration) | Hobby: 10s (default) - [configurable](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/configuring-functions/duration) up to 60s, Pro: 15s (default) - [configurable](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/configuring-functions/duration) up to 300s, Ent: 15s (default) - [configurable](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/configuring-functions/duration) up to 900s | 25s (to begin returning a response, but can continue [streaming](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/streaming) data.) |\n| [Max memory](#memory-size-limits) | Hobby: 1024 MB, Pro and Ent: 3009 MB | 128 MB |\n| [Max environment variable size](#environment-variables) | 64 KB | 64 KB |\n| [Max request body size](#request-body-size) | 4.5 MB | 4 MB |\n\nVercel places restrictions on the maximum size of the deployment bundle for functions to ensure that they execute in a timely manner.\n\nFor Serverless Functions, the maximum uncompressed size is 250 MB including layers which are automatically used depending on [runtimes](#runtime). These limits are [enforced by AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/gettingstarted-limits.html).\n\nYou can use [`includeFiles` and `excludeFiles`](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/project-configuration#functions) to specify items which may affect the function size, however the limits cannot be configured. These configurations are not supported in Next.js, instead use [`outputFileTracingIncludes`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/output).\n\nEdge Functions have plan-dependent size limits. This is the total, compressed size of your function and its dependencies after bundling.\n\nThis refers to the longest time a function can process an HTTP request before responding.\n\nFunctions using the Edge runtime do not have a maximum duration. They must begin sending a response within 25 seconds and can continue [streaming](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/streaming) a response beyond that time.\n\nWhile Serverless Functions have a default duration, this duration can be extended using the [maxDuration config](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/configuring-functions/duration). If a Serverless Function doesn't respond within the duration, a 504 error code ([`FUNCTION_INVOCATION_TIMEOUT`](https://vercel.com/docs/errors/EDGE_FUNCTION_INVOCATION_TIMEOUT)) is returned.\n\nServerless Functions have the following defaults and maximum limits for the duration of a function:\n\n|     | Default | Maximum |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Hobby | 10s | 60s |\n| Pro | 15s | 300s |\n| Enterprise | 15s | 900s |\n\nServerless Functions can use more memory and larger CPUs than Edge Functions. They have the following defaults and maximum limits:\n\n|     | Default | Maximum |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Hobby | 1024 MB / 0.6 vCPU | 1024 MB / 0.6 vCPU |\n| Pro /Enterprise | 1769 MB / 1 vCPU | 3009 MB / 1.7 vCPU |\n\nUsers on Pro and Enterprise plans can [configure the default memory size](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/configuring-functions/memory#setting-your-default-function-memory-/-cpu-size) for all functions in the dashboard, or on a [per-function basis](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/configuring-functions/memory#setting-custom-function-memory-size) in your `vercel.json`.\n\nEdge Functions have a fixed memory limit. When you exceeds this limit, the execution will be aborted and we will return a `502` error.\n\nThe maximum size for a Function includes your JavaScript code, imported libraries and files (such as fonts), and all files bundled in the function.\n\nIf you reach the limit, make sure the code you are importing in your function is used and is not too heavy. You can use a package size checker tool like [bundle](https://bundle.js.org/) to check the size of a package and search for a smaller alternative.\n\nYou can use [environment variables](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables#environment-variable-size) to manage dynamic values and sensitive information affecting the operation of your functions. Vercel allows developers to define these variables either at deployment or during runtime.\n\nYou can use a total of 64 KB in environments variables per-deployment on Vercel. This limit is for all variables combined, and so no single variable can be larger than 64 KB.\n\nIn Vercel, the request body size is the maximum amount of data that can be included in the body of a request to a function.\n\nThe maximum payload size for the request body or the response body of a Serverless Function is 4.5 MB. If a Serverless Function receives a payload in excess of the limit it will return an error [413: FUNCTION\\_PAYLOAD\\_TOO\\_LARGE](https://vercel.com/docs/errors/FUNCTION_PAYLOAD_TOO_LARGE). See [How do I bypass the 4.5MB body size limit of Vercel Serverless Functions](https://vercel.com/guides/how-to-bypass-vercel-body-size-limit-serverless-functions) for more information.\n\nEdge Functions have the following additional limits to the request size:\n\n| Name | Limit |\n| --- | --- |\n| Maximum URL length | 14 KB |\n| Maximum request body length | 4 MB |\n| Maximum number of request headers | 64  |\n| Maximum request headers length | 16 KB |\n\n|     | Node.js runtime (and more) | Edge runtime |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Geolocation data | [Yes](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/headers#x-vercel-ip-country) | [Yes](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/edge-functions/vercel-edge-package#geolocation) |\n| Access request headers | Yes | Yes |\n| Cache responses | [Yes](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/caching#using-vercel-functions) | [Yes](https://vercel.com/docs/edge-network/caching#using-vercel-functions) |\n\nYou can learn more about API support and writing functions:\n\n*   Serverless Functions: [Node.js runtime](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/runtimes/node-js)\n*   Edge Functions: [Edge Functions API](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/edge-functions/edge-functions-api)\n\nEdge Functions are neither Node.js nor browser applications, which means they don't have access to all browser and Node.js APIs. Currently, the Edge runtime offers [a subset of browser APIs](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/runtimes/edge-runtime) and [some Node.js APIs](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/runtimes/edge-runtime#unsupported-apis).\n\nThere are some restrictions when writing Edge Functions:\n\n*   Use ES modules\n*   Most libraries which use Node.js APIs as dependencies can't be used in Edge Functions yet. See [available APIs](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/edge-functions/edge-runtime#supported-apis) for a full list\n*   Dynamic code execution (such as `eval`) is not allowed for security reasons. You must ensure libraries used in your Edge Functions don't rely on dynamic code execution because it leads to a runtime error. For example, the following APIs cannot be used:\n\n*   You cannot set non-standard port numbers in the fetch URL (e.g., `https://example.com:8080`). Only `80` and `443` are allowed. If you set a non-standard port number, the port number is ignored, and the request is sent to port `80` for `http://` URL, or port `443` for `https://` URL.\n*   The maximum number of requests from `fetch` API is 950 per Edge Function invocation.\n*   The maximum number of open connections is 6.\n    *   Each function invocation can have up to 6 open connections. For example, if you try to send 10 simultaneous fetch requests, only 6 of them can be processed at a time. The remaining requests are put into a waiting queue and will be processed accordingly as those in-flight requests are completed.\n*   If in-flight requests have been waiting for a response for more than 15 seconds with no active reads/writes, the runtime may cancel them based on its LRU (Least Recently Used) logic.\n    *   If you attempt to use a canceled connection, the `Network connection lost.` exception will be thrown.\n    *   You can `catch` on the `fetch` promise to handle this exception gracefully (e.g. with retries). Additionally, you can use the [`AbortController`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortController) API to set timeouts for `fetch` requests.\n\nTo avoid CPU timing attacks, like Spectre, date and time functionality is not generally available. In particular, the time returned from `Date.now()` only advances after I/O operations, like `fetch`. For example:\n\n```\nexport const runtime = 'edge';\n \nexport async function GET(request: Request) {\n  const currentDate = () => new Date().toISOString();\n  for (let i = 0; i < 500; i++) {\n    console.log(`Current Date before fetch: ${currentDate()}`); // Prints the same value 1000 times.\n  }\n \n  await fetch('https://worldtimeapi.org/api/timezone/Etc/UTC');\n  console.log(`Current Date after fetch: ${currentDate()}`); // Prints the new time\n \n  return Response.json({ date: currentDate() });\n}\n```\n\n|     | Node.js runtime (and more) | Edge runtime |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| [Billing](#billing-model) | Pay for wall-clock time | Pay for CPU time |\n\nThe Hobby plan offers functions for free, within [limits](https://vercel.com/docs/limits/overview). The Pro plan extends these limits, billing Serverless Functions on [wall-clock time](https://vercel.com/guides/what-are-gb-hrs-for-serverless-function-execution) and Edge runtime-powered Functions on [CPU time](https://vercel.com/docs/limits/usage#execution-units).\n\nThis aligns with the intended usage of each: Serverless for intermittent heavy tasks, and Edge for continuous low-latency tasks. The Edge runtime is particularly well-suited for querying databases or other backends, like an AI service, since you will not be billed for the time making the request, only the time processing the response.\n\nSee [Usage and Pricing](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/usage-and-pricing) for more information.\n\nEdge Middleware can use no more than 50 ms of CPU time on average.\n\nThis limitation refers to actual net CPU time, which is the time spent performing calculations, not the total elapsed execution or \"wall clock\" time. For example, when you are blocked talking to the network, the time spent waiting for a response does _not_ count toward CPU time limitations.\n\n|     | Node.js runtime (and more) | Edge runtime |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| [Secure Compute](#secure-compute) | Supported | Not Supported |\n| [Streaming](#streaming) | Supported, depending on the framework | Supported |\n| [Cron jobs](#cron-jobs) | Supported | Supported |\n| [Vercel Storage](#storage) | Supported | Supported |\n| [Edge Config](#edge-config) | Supported only in Node.js runtime | Supported |\n| [OTEL](#otel) | Supported | Not supported |\n\nVercel's [Secure Compute](https://vercel.com/docs/security/secure-compute) feature offers enhanced security for your Serverless Functions, including dedicated IP addresses and VPN options. This can be particularly important for functions that handle sensitive data.\n\nStreaming refers to the ability to send or receive data in a continuous flow.\n\nBoth the Node.js and the [Edge runtime](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/edge-functions/edge-runtime) support streaming.\n\nIn addition, Serverless Functions have a [maximum duration](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/configuring-functions/duration), meaning that it isn't possible to stream indefinitely. Edge Functions do not have a maximum duration, but you must send an _initial_ response within 25 seconds. You can continue [streaming a response](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/streaming) beyond that time.\n\n[Cron jobs](https://vercel.com/docs/cron-jobs) are time-based scheduling tools used to automate repetitive tasks. When a cron job is triggered through the [cron expression](https://vercel.com/docs/cron-jobs#cron-expressions), it calls a Vercel Function.\n\nFrom your function, you can communicate with a choice of [data stores](https://vercel.com/docs/storage). To ensure low-latency responses, it's crucial to have compute close to your databases. Always deploy your databases in regions closest to your functions to avoid long network roundtrips. For more information, see our [best practices](https://vercel.com/docs/storage#locate-your-data-close-to-your-functions) documentation.\n\nAn [Edge Config](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/edge-config) is a global data store that enables experimentation with feature flags, A/B testing, critical redirects, and IP blocking. It enables you to read data at the edge without querying an external database or hitting upstream servers.\n\nVercel has an [OpenTelemetry (OTEL) collector](https://vercel.com/docs/observability/otel-overview) that allows you to send OTEL traces from your Serverless Functions to application performance monitoring (APM) vendors such as New Relic.",

    "markdown": "# Deploying Git Repositories with Vercel\n\nVercel allows for automatic deployments on every branch push and merges onto the [production branch](#production-branch) of your [GitHub](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/git/vercel-for-github), [GitLab](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/git/vercel-for-gitlab), [Bitbucket](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/git/vercel-for-bitbucket) and [Azure DevOps Pipelines](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/git/vercel-for-azure-pipelines) projects.\n\nUsing Git with Vercel provides the following benefits:\n\n*   [Preview deployments](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/preview-deployments#) for every push.\n*   [Production deployments](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/environments#production) for the most recent changes from the [production branch](#production-branch).\n*   Instant rollbacks when reverting changes assigned to a custom domain.\n\nWhen working with Git, have a branch that works as your production branch, often called `main`. After you create a pull request (PR) to that branch, Vercel creates a unique deployment you can use to preview any changes. Once you are happy with the changes, you can merge your PR into the `main` branch, and Vercel will create a production deployment.\n\nYou can choose to use a different branch as the [production branch](#production-branch).\n\nIf your provider is not listed here, you can also use the [Vercel CLI to deploy](https://vercel.com/guides/using-vercel-cli-for-custom-workflows) with any git provider.\n\nSetting up your GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket repository on Vercel is only a matter of clicking the [\"New Project\"](https://vercel.com/new) button on the top right of your dashboard and following the steps.\n\nAfter clicking it, you'll be presented with a list of Git repositories that the Git account you've signed up with has write access to.\n\nTo select a different Git namespace or provider, you can use the dropdown list on the top left of the section.\n\n![](https://vercel.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.vercel.com%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1689795055%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Fconcepts%2Fdeployments%2Fgit%2Findex%2Frepo-list-light.png&w=1200&q=75&dpl=dpl_6RGLzPaeBNhuWHRxN1xTYtAhKUa3)![](https://vercel.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.vercel.com%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1689795055%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Fconcepts%2Fdeployments%2Fgit%2Findex%2Frepo-list-dark.png&w=1200&q=75&dpl=dpl_6RGLzPaeBNhuWHRxN1xTYtAhKUa3)\n\nA list of Git repositories your Git account has access to.\n\nYou can also:\n\n*   Select a third-party Git repository by clicking on [Import Third-Party Git Repository](https://vercel.com/new/git/third-party) on the bottom of the section.\n*   Select a pre-built solution from the section on the right.\n\nAfter you've selected the Git repository or template you want to use for your new project, you'll be taken to a page where you can configure your project before it's deployed.\n\nYou can:\n\n*   Customize the project's name\n*   Select [a Framework Preset](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/configure-a-build#framework-preset)\n*   Select the root directory of your project\n*   Configure [Build Output Settings](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/configure-a-build#build-command)\n*   Set [Environment Variables](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables)\n\nWhen your settings are correct, you can select the Deploy button to initiate a deployment.\n\nYou can initiate new deployments directly from the Vercel Dashboard using a Git reference. This approach is ideal when automatic deployments are interrupted or unavailable.\n\nTo create a deployment from a Git reference:\n\n1.  From your [dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard), select the project you'd like to create a deployment for\n    \n2.  Select the Deployments tab. Once on the Deployments page, select the Create Deployment button\n    \n3.  Depending on how you would like to deploy, enter the following:\n    \n    *   Targeted Deployments: Provide the unique ID (SHA) of a commit to build a deployment based on that specific commit\n    *   Branch-Based Deployments: Provide the full name of a branch when you want to build the most recent changes from that specific branch (for example, `https://github.com/vercel/examples/tree/deploy`)\n4.  Select Create Deployment. Vercel will build and deploy your commit or branch as usual\n    \n\nWhen the same commit appears in multiple branches, Vercel will prompt you to choose the appropriate branch configuration. This choice is crucial as it affects settings like environment variables linked to each branch.\n\nAs an additional security measure, commits on private Git repositories (and commits of forks that are targeting those Git repositories) will only be deployed if the commit author also has access to the respective project on Vercel.\n\nDepending on whether the owner of the connected Vercel project is a Hobby or a Pro team, the behavior changes as mentioned in the sections below.\n\nThis only applies to commit authors on GitHub organizations, GitLab groups and non-personal Bitbucket workspaces. It does not apply to collaborators on personal Git accounts.\n\nFor public Git repositories, [a different behavior](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/git#deploying-forks-of-public-git-repositories) applies.\n\nTo deploy commits under a Vercel Pro team, the commit author must be a member of the team containing the Vercel project connected to the Git repository.\n\nMembership is verified by finding the Hobby account associated with the commit author through [Login Connections](https://vercel.com/docs/accounts/create-an-account#login-methods-and-connections). If a Hobby account is found, it checks if the account is a member of the Pro team.\n\nIf the commit author is not a member, the deployment will be prevented, and the commit author can request to join the team. The team owners will be notified and can accept or decline the membership request on the [Members](https://vercel.com/docs/accounts/team-members-and-roles) page in the team Settings.\n\nIf the request is declined, the commit will remain undeployed. If the commit author is accepted as a member of the Pro team, their most recent commit will automatically resume deployment to Vercel.\n\nCommit authors are automatically considered part of the Pro team on Vercel if one of the existing members has connected their Hobby account on Vercel with the Git account that created the commit.\n\nTo deploy commits under a Hobby account, the commit author must be the owner of the Hobby account containing the Vercel project connected to the Git repository. This is verified by comparing the [Login Connections](https://vercel.com/docs/accounts/create-an-account#login-methods-and-connections) defined in the Hobby account with the commit author.\n\nIf the commit author is not the owner of the destination Hobby account, the deployment will be prevented, and a recommendation to transfer the project to a Pro team will be displayed on the Git provider.\n\nAfter transferring the project to a Pro team, commit authors can be added as members of that team. The behavior mentioned in the [section above](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/git#using-pro-teams) will then apply to them whenever they commit.\n\nWhen a public repository is forked, commits from it will usually deploy automatically. However, when you receive a pull request from a fork of your repository that includes a change to the [`vercel.json`](https://vercel.com/docs/cli) file or the project has [Environment Variables](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables), Vercel will require authorization from you or a [team member](https://vercel.com/docs/accounts/team-members-and-roles) to deploy the pull request. This is a security measure that protects you from leaking sensitive project information. A link to authorize the deployment will be posted as a comment on the Pull Request.\n\nThe authorization step will be skipped if the commit author is already a [team member](https://vercel.com/docs/accounts/team-members-and-roles) on Vercel.\n\nA [Production deployment](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/environments#production) will be created each time you merge to the production branch.\n\nWhen you create a new Project from a Git repository on Vercel, the Production Branch will be selected in the following order:\n\n*   The `main` branch.\n*   If not present, the `master` branch ([more details](https://vercel.com/blog/custom-production-branch#a-note-on-the-master-branch)).\n*   \\[Only for Bitbucket\\] If not present, the \"production branch\" setting of your Git repository is used.\n*   If not present, the Git repository's default branch.\n\nOn the Git page in the Project Settings, you can change your production branch.\n\nWhenever a new commit is then pushed to the branch you configured here, a [production deployment](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/environments#production) will be created for you.\n\nWhile the production branch (mentioned above) is a single Git branch that contains the code that is served to your visitors, Preview Branches are all the Git branches that are not the production branch.\n\nFor example, if your production branch is `main`, then all the Git branches that are not `main` are considered Preview Branches. That means there can be many Preview Branches, but only a single production branch.\n\nPreview Branches, like the name already suggests, are used for previewing changes before presenting them to your visitors (merging them into production).\n\nBy default, every Preview Branch automatically receives its own Domain similar to the one shown below, whenever a commit is pushed to it:\n\n```\n<project-name>-git-<branch-name>-<scope-slug>.vercel.app;\n```\n\nAdditionally, any Environment Variables defined for the [Preview Environment](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables#preview-environment-variables) are applied.\n\nYou can also receive feedback from team members and other collaborators through [Vercel's Comments feature](https://vercel.com/docs/workflow-collaboration/comments). Comments can be tracked and resolved from within a PR on GitHub.\n\nOnce you're happy with your changes, you would then merge the respective Preview Branch into your production branch.\n\nFor most use cases, the default Preview behavior mentioned above is enough.\n\nIf you'd like your changes to pass through multiple phases of previewing instead of just one, you can accomplish it like so:\n\nDomains and Environment Variables can both be assigned to specific Preview Branches on their individual settings pages. For Domains, it can be done [like this](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/domains/assign-domain-to-a-git-branch) and for Environment Variables [like this](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables#preview-environment-variables).\n\nFor example, you could create a phase called \"Staging\" where you can accumulate Preview changes before merging them onto production by following these steps:\n\n1.  Create a Git branch called \"staging\" in your Git repository.\n2.  Add a Domain of your choice (like \"staging.example.com\") on your Vercel project and assign it to the \"staging\" Git branch [like this](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/domains/assign-domain-to-a-git-branch).\n3.  Add Environment Variables that you'd like to use for your new Staging phase on your Vercel project [like this](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables#preview-environment-variables).\n\nAfterwards, you can push to the \"staging\" Git branch to update your Staging phase and it will automatically receive the Domain and Environment Variables you've defined.\n\nOnce you're happy with your changes, you would then merge the respective Preview Branch into your production branch. However, unlike with the default Preview behavior, you'd then keep the branch around instead of deleting it, so that you can push to it again in the future.",

[Members of your team](https://vercel.com/docs/accounts/create-a-team) and people you share your previews with can give feedback on these changes with [Comments](#comments), if enabled.\n\nVercel creates a new preview deployment by default when:\n\n*   You commit changes to a connected Git branch that is not the production branch (e.g. `main`)\n*   You create a deployment using [our CLI's `vercel` command](https://vercel.com/docs/cli/deploy#usage)\n\nIf you'd rather not generate Preview Deployments, [you can turn them off](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/preview-deployments#turning-off-preview-deployments).\n\nAll Preview Deployments come with the Vercel Toolbar, which enables your team to:\n\n*   Leave feedback in your production environment with [Comments](https://vercel.com/docs/workflow-collaboration/comments)\n*   [Navigate to useful dashboard pages](#using-the-command-menu)\n*   [Share your Deployment](#sharing-deployments)\n\nSee [our Vercel Toolbar docs](https://vercel.com/docs/workflow-collaboration/vercel-toolbar) to learn more.\n\nIf you have created a pull or merge request when using [Git](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/git), the [generated preview URL](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/generated-urls) will be available as a comment from the Vercel bot. This URL will always reflect the latest deployment changes.\n\nAlternatively, in your [dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard):\n\n1.  Select your project and select the Deployments tab\n2.  Filter by Preview deployments to show all commits to any non-production branches\n3.  Find your commit and select the URL under Domains. This URL will display only the changes relating to that deployment\n\nAll your Preview Deployments will have a Share button in the [Vercel Toolbar](https://vercel.com/docs/workflow-collaboration/vercel-toolbar), which can be used to share access for private preview URLs with all team members. To learn more, see [Sharing Deployments](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/sharing-deployments).\n\nIf you're on an Enterprise team, you will be able to see who shared deployment URLs in your [audit logs](https://vercel.com/docs/observability/audit-log).\n\nYou can turn off Preview Deployments by using the \"[Ignore Build Step](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/overview#ignored-build-step)\" option. For example, using this command, you can tell Vercel to only build your `main` branch and ignore all other branches. If the command returns \"0\", the build is skipped. If, however, a code \"1\" or greater is returned, a new deployment is built. For more information on ignoring the build step, see [How do I use the \"Ignored Build Step\" field on Vercel?](https://vercel.com/guides/how-do-i-use-the-ignored-build-step-field-on-vercel).\n\nYou can receive feedback on your Preview Deployments from your team members and [people you share the Preview URL](https://vercel.com/docs/workflow-collaboration/comments/how-comments-work#enable-or-disable-comments) with through the Comments feature.\n\nComments allow teams [and participants outside the team](https://vercel.com/docs/workflow-collaboration/comments/how-comments-work#enable-or-disable-comments) to give direct feedback on Preview Deployments. Comments can be added directly over the areas of your site that are relevant to the feedback, and discussion threads can continue within the Preview Deployment itself or [in an integrated Slack channel](https://vercel.com/docs/workflow-collaboration/comments/integrations#use-the-vercel-slack-beta-app).\n\n[Learn more in the Comments docs](https://vercel.com/docs/workflow-collaboration/comments).\n\nThe Vercel Toolbar is available by default in all Preview Deployments. Learn more about its features in [our Deployment docs](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments#using-the-command-menu).\n\nSince a Preview Deployment creates a new version of your site under a different domain, a search engine would consider it as a new website when crawling it.\n\nThis can have a negative impact on the ranking of your main site since crawlers are able to detect when content is duplicated across multiple domains and lower the ranking of your site when measuring the content quality.\n\nTo prevent that, the `X-Robots-Tag` HTTP header is automatically set to `noindex` for all Preview Deployments so that search engines do not accidentally index the Preview URLs.\n\nWhen a [custom domain is assigned to a Git branch](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/domains/assign-domain-to-a-git-branch), this behavior is prevented. In that case, the `X-Robots-Tag` header is not set.\n\nTo learn more about the `X-Robots-Tag`, review this [Google Search Reference](https://developers.google.com/search/reference/robots_meta_tag#xrobotstag).",

    "url": "https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/skew-protection",
    "markdown": "# Skew Protection\n\n[Version skew](https://www.industrialempathy.com/posts/version-skew/) occurs when different versions of your application run on client and server, causing application errors and other unexpected behavior. For example, imagine your newest deployment modifies the data structure by adding a required field to a user's profile. Older clients wouldn't expect this new field, leading to errors when they submit it.\n\nVercel's Skew Protection resolves this problem at the platform and framework layer by using [version locking](https://www.industrialempathy.com/posts/version-skew/#version-locking), which ensures client and server use the exact same version. In our example, outdated clients continue to communicate with servers that understand the old data structure, while updated clients use the most recent deployment.\n\n![](https://vercel.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.vercel.com%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1687260660%2Ffront%2Fdocs%2Fdeployments-basics%2Fnested-layouts-light.png&w=3840&q=75&dpl=dpl_6RGLzPaeBNhuWHRxN1xTYtAhKUa3)![](https://vercel.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.vercel.com%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1687260679%2Ffront%2Fdocs%2Fdeployments-basics%2Fnested-layouts-dark.png&w=3840&q=75&dpl=dpl_6RGLzPaeBNhuWHRxN1xTYtAhKUa3)\n\nBy implementing Skew Protection, you can reduce user-facing errors during new rollouts and boost developer productivity, minimizing concerns about API compatibility across versions.\n\nIf you are using one of the [supported frameworks](#supported-frameworks), you can enable Skew Protection in your project settings.\n\n1.  Select the project in the Vercel dashboard\n2.  Select the Settings tab in the top menu\n3.  Select the Advanced tab in the side menu\n4.  Scroll down to Skew Protection and enable the switch\n5.  For Enterprise Teams, you can also set a custom duration (see [limitations](#limitations))\n\n![A screenshot of the Skew Protection section containing an enabled/disabled toggle switch.](https://vercel.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.vercel.com%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1710448647%2Ffront%2Fdocs%2Fprojects%2Fskew-protection-light.jpg&w=1920&q=75&dpl=dpl_6RGLzPaeBNhuWHRxN1xTYtAhKUa3)![A screenshot of the Skew Protection section containing an enabled/disabled toggle switch.](https://vercel.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.vercel.com%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1710448647%2Ffront%2Fdocs%2Fprojects%2Fskew-protection-dark.jpg&w=1920&q=75&dpl=dpl_6RGLzPaeBNhuWHRxN1xTYtAhKUa3)\n\nA screenshot of the Skew Protection section containing an enabled/disabled toggle switch.\n\nIn some cases, you may have problematic deployments you want to ensure no longer resolves requests from any other active clients.\n\nOnce you deploy a fix, you can Configure Skew Protection with the following:\n\n1.  Select the deployment that fixed the problem in the deployment list\n2.  Select the button (near the Visit button)\n3.  Click Configure Skew Protection\n4.
