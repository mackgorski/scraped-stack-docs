Do not save AccountSessions to your database as they expire relatively quickly, and cannot be used more than once.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect embedded components](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-connect-embedded-components)\n\n## [Application Fees](https://docs.stripe.com/api/application_fees)\n\nWhen you collect a transaction fee on top of a charge made for your user (using [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)), an `Application Fee` object is created in your account. You can list, retrieve, and refund application fees.\n\nRelated guide: [Collecting application fees](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges#collect-fees)\n\n## [Country Specs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/country_specs)\n\nStripe needs to collect certain pieces of information about each account created. These requirements can differ depending on the account’s country. The Country Specs API makes these rules available to your integration.\n\nYou can also view the information from this API call as [an online guide](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information).\n\n## [Person](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/create)[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/update)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/retrieve)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/list)[DELETE/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/delete)\n\n## [Transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/transfers)\n\nA `Transfer` object is created when you move funds between Stripe accounts as part of Connect.\n\nBefore April 6, 2017, transfers also represented movement of funds from a Stripe account to a card or bank account. This behavior has since been split out into a [Payout](#payout_object) object, with corresponding payout endpoints. For more information, read about the [transfer/payout split](https://docs.stripe.com/transfer-payout-split).\n\nRelated guide: [Creating separate charges and transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n\n## [Secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/secret_management)\n\nSecret Store is an API that allows Stripe Apps developers to securely persist secrets for use by UI Extensions and app backends.\n\nThe primary resource in Secret Store is a `secret`. Other apps can’t view secrets created by an app. Additionally, secrets are scoped to provide further permission control.\n\nAll Dashboard users and the app backend share `account` scoped secrets. Use the `account` scope for secrets that don’t change per-user, like a third-party API key.\n\nA `user` scoped secret is accessible by the app backend and one specific Dashboard user. Use the `user` scope for per-user secrets like per-user OAuth tokens, where different users might have different permissions.\n\nRelated guide: [Store data between page reloads](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/store-auth-data-custom-objects)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[GET/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/list)[POST/v1/apps/secrets/delete](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/delete)[GET/v1/apps/secrets/find](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/find)[POST/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/set)\n\n## [Reviews](https://docs.stripe.com/api/radar/reviews)\n\nReviews can be used to supplement automated fraud detection with human expertise.\n\nLearn more about [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar) and reviewing payments [here](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/reviews).\n\n## [Authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/update)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/list)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/approve](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/approve)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/decline](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/decline)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_create)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/capture](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_capture)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/expire](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_expire)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/finalize\\_amount](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_finalize_amount)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/increment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_increment)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/fraud\\_challenges/respond](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/respond_to_fraud_challenges)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/reverse](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_reverse)\n\n## [Cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/create)[POST/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/update)[GET/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/list)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/deliver](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_deliver)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/fail](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_fail)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/return](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_return)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/ship](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_ship)\n\n## [Physical Bundles](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/physical_bundles)\n\nA Physical Bundle represents the bundle of physical items - card stock, carrier letter, and envelope - that is shipped to a cardholder when you create a physical card.\n\n## [Reader](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/terminal/readers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/create)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/update)[GET/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/retrieve)[GET/v1/terminal/readers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/list)[DELETE/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/delete)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/cancel\\_action](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/cancel_action)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/collect\\_inputs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/collect_inputs)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/confirm\\_payment\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/confirm_payment_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/collect\\_payment\\_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/collect_payment_method)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/process\\_payment\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/process_payment_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/process\\_setup\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/process_setup_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/refund\\_payment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/refund_payment)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/set\\_reader\\_display](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/set_reader_display)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/terminal/readers/:id/present\\_payment\\_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/present_payment_method)\n\n## [Terminal Hardware Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_products)Preview feature\n\nA TerminalHardwareProduct is a category of hardware devices that are generally similar, but may have variations depending on the country it’s shipped to.\n\nTerminalHardwareSKUs represent variations within the same Product (for example, a country specific device). For example, WisePOS E is a TerminalHardwareProduct and a WisePOS E - US and WisePOS E - UK are TerminalHardwareSKUs.\n\n## [Terminal Hardware SKU](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_skus)Preview feature\n\nA TerminalHardwareSKU represents a SKU for Terminal hardware. A SKU is a representation of a product available for purchase, containing information such as the name, price, and images.\n\n## [Transaction Entries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/transaction_entries)\n\nTransactionEntries represent individual units of money movements within a single [Transaction](#transactions).\n\n## [Scheduled Queries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/sigma/scheduled_queries)\n\nIf you have [scheduled a Sigma query](https://docs.stripe.com/sigma/scheduled-queries), you’ll receive a `sigma.scheduled_query_run.created` webhook each time the query runs. The webhook contains a `ScheduledQueryRun` object, which you can use to retrieve the query results.\n\n## [Report Types](https://docs.stripe.com/api/reporting/report_type)\n\nThe Report Type resource corresponds to a particular type of report, such as the “Activity summary” or “Itemized payouts” reports. These objects are identified by an ID belonging to a set of enumerated values. See [API Access to Reports documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/reporting/statements/api) for those Report Type IDs, along with required and optional parameters.\n\nNote that certain report types can only be run based on your live-mode data (not test-mode data), and will error when queried without a [live-mode API key](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#test-live-modes).\n\n## [Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/financial_connections/sessions)\n\nA Financial Connections Session is the secure way to programmatically launch the client-side Stripe.js modal that lets your users link their accounts.\n\n## [Verification Report](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_reports)\n\nA VerificationReport is the result of an attempt to collect and verify data from a user. The collection of verification checks performed is determined from the `type` and `options` parameters used. You can find the result of each verification check performed in the appropriate sub-resource: `document`, `id_number`, `selfie`.\n\nEach VerificationReport contains a copy of any data collected by the user as well as reference IDs which can be used to access collected images through the [FileUpload](https://docs.stripe.com/api/files) API. To configure and create VerificationReports, use the [VerificationSession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_sessions) API.\n\nRelated guide: [Accessing verification results](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verification-sessions#results).\n\n## [Crypto Onramp Quotes](https://docs.stripe.com/api/crypto/onramp_quotes)\n\nCrypto Onramp Quotes are estimated quotes for onramp conversions into all the different cryptocurrencies on different networks. The Quotes API allows you to display quotes in your product UI before directing the user to the onramp widget.\n\nRelated guide: [Quotes API](https://docs.stripe.com/crypto/quotes-api)\n\n## [Climate Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/climate/product)\n\nA Climate product represents a type of carbon removal unit available for reservation. You can retrieve it to see the current price and availability.\n\n## [Forwarding Request](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/request)\n\nInstructs Stripe to make a request on your behalf using the destination URL. The destination URL is activated by Stripe at the time of onboarding. Stripe verifies requests with your credentials provided during onboarding, and injects card details from the payment\\_method into the request.\n\nStripe redacts all sensitive fields and headers, including authentication credentials and card numbers, before storing the request and response data in the forwarding Request object, which are subject to a 30-day retention period.\n\nYou can provide a Stripe idempotency key to make sure that requests with the same key result in only one outbound request. The Stripe idempotency key provided should be unique and different from any idempotency keys provided on the underlying third-party request.\n\nForwarding Requests are synchronous requests that return a response or time out according to Stripe’s limits.\n\nRelated guide: [Forward card details to third-party API endpoints](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/forwarding).\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/create)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/retrieve)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/list)",

For example, WisePOS E is a TerminalHardwareProduct and a WisePOS E - US and WisePOS E - UK are TerminalHardwareSKUs.\n\n## [Terminal Hardware SKU](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_skus)Preview feature\n\nA TerminalHardwareSKU represents a SKU for Terminal hardware. A SKU is a representation of a product available for purchase, containing information such as the name, price, and images.\n\n## [Transaction Entries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/transaction_entries)\n\nTransactionEntries represent individual units of money movements within a single [Transaction](#transactions).\n\n## [Scheduled Queries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/sigma/scheduled_queries)\n\nIf you have [scheduled a Sigma query](https://docs.stripe.com/sigma/scheduled-queries), you’ll receive a `sigma.scheduled_query_run.created` webhook each time the query runs. The webhook contains a `ScheduledQueryRun` object, which you can use to retrieve the query results.\n\n## [Report Types](https://docs.stripe.com/api/reporting/report_type)\n\nThe Report Type resource corresponds to a particular type of report, such as the “Activity summary” or “Itemized payouts” reports. These objects are identified by an ID belonging to a set of enumerated values. See [API Access to Reports documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/reporting/statements/api) for those Report Type IDs, along with required and optional parameters.\n\nNote that certain report types can only be run based on your live-mode data (not test-mode data), and will error when queried without a [live-mode API key](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#test-live-modes).\n\n## [Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/financial_connections/sessions)\n\nA Financial Connections Session is the secure way to programmatically launch the client-side Stripe.js modal that lets your users link their accounts.\n\n## [Verification Report](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_reports)\n\nA VerificationReport is the result of an attempt to collect and verify data from a user. The collection of verification checks performed is determined from the `type` and `options` parameters used. You can find the result of each verification check performed in the appropriate sub-resource: `document`, `id_number`, `selfie`.\n\nEach VerificationReport contains a copy of any data collected by the user as well as reference IDs which can be used to access collected images through the [FileUpload](https://docs.stripe.com/api/files) API. To configure and create VerificationReports, use the [VerificationSession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_sessions) API.\n\nRelated guide: [Accessing verification results](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verification-sessions#results).\n\n## [Crypto Onramp Quotes](https://docs.stripe.com/api/crypto/onramp_quotes)\n\nCrypto Onramp Quotes are estimated quotes for onramp conversions into all the different cryptocurrencies on different networks.

  "markdown": "# Create a usage record | Stripe API Reference\n\nCreates a usage record for a specified subscription item and date, and fills it with a quantity.\n\nUsage records provide `quantity` information that Stripe uses to track how much a customer is using your service. With usage information and the pricing model set up by the [metered billing](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/metered-billing) plan, Stripe helps you send accurate invoices to your customers.\n\nThe default calculation for usage is to add up all the `quantity` values of the usage records within a billing period. You can change this default behavior with the billing plan’s `aggregate_usage` [parameter](https://docs.stripe.com/api/plans/create#create_plan-aggregate_usage). When there is more than one usage record with the same timestamp, Stripe adds the `quantity` values together. In most cases, this is the desired resolution, however, you can change this behavior with the `action` parameter.\n\nThe default pricing model for metered billing is [per-unit pricing](https://docs.stripe.com/api/plans/object#plan_object-billing_scheme). For finer granularity, you can configure metered billing to have a [tiered pricing](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/tiers) model.\n\n### Parameters\n\n*   The usage quantity for the specified timestamp.\n    \n*   Valid values are `increment` (default) or `set`. When using `increment` the specified `quantity` will be added to the usage at the specified timestamp. The `set` action will overwrite the usage quantity at that timestamp. If the subscription has [billing thresholds](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/object#subscription_object-billing_thresholds), `increment` is the only allowed value.\n    \n*   #### \n    \n    timestampstring | timestamp\n    \n    The timestamp for the usage event. This timestamp must be within the current billing period of the subscription of the provided `subscription_item`, and must not be in the future. When passing `\"now\"`, Stripe records usage for the current time. Default is `\"now\"` if a value is not provided.\n    \n\n### Returns\n\nReturns the usage record object.\n\nPOST /v1/subscription\\_items/:id/usage\\_records\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/subscription_items/si_IutmSSymhsWA5i/usage_records \\  -u \"sk_test_4eC39Hq...arjtT1zdp7dcsk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc:\" \\  -d quantity=100 \\  -d timestamp=1571252444\n```\n\n```\n{  \"id\": \"mbur_1IJ3zE2eZvKYlo2CsJAtf1Jl\",  \"object\": \"usage_record\",  \"livemode\": false,  \"quantity\": 100,  \"subscription_item\": \"si_IutmSSymhsWA5i\",  \"timestamp\": 1571252444}\n```\n\n## [List all subscription item period summaries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/usage_records/subscription_item_summary_list)\n\nFor the specified subscription item, returns a list of summary objects. Each object in the list provides usage information that’s been summarized from multiple usage records and over a subscription billing period (e.g., 15 usage records in the month of September).\n\nThe list is sorted in reverse-chronological order (newest first). The first list item represents the most current usage period that hasn’t ended yet. Since new usage records can still be added, the returned summary information for the subscription item’s ID should be seen as unstable until the subscription billing period ends.\n\n### Parameters\n\nNo parameters.\n\n### More parameters\n\n### Returns\n\nA dictionary with a `data` property that contains an array of up to `limit` summaries, starting after summary `starting_after`. Each entry in the array is a separate summary object. If no more summaries are available, the resulting array is empty.\n\nGET /v1/subscription\\_items/:id/usage\\_record\\_summaries\n\n```\ncurl -G https://api.stripe.com/v1/subscription_items/si_E9xjsAhGRXCCWe/usage_record_summaries \\  -u \"sk_test_4eC39Hq...arjtT1zdp7dcsk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc:\" \\  -d limit=3\n```\n\n```\n{  \"object\": \"list\",  \"url\": \"/v1/subscription_items/si_E9xjsAhGRXCCWe/usage_record_summaries\",  \"has_more\": false,  \"data\": [    {      \"object\": \"list\",      \"url\": \"/v1/subscription_items/si_E9xjsAhGRXCCWe/usage_record_summaries\",      \"has_more\": false,      \"data\": [        {          \"id\": \"sis_1Bnyrd2eZvKYlo2CuVcUbXln\",          \"object\": \"usage_record_summary\",          \"invoice\": \"in_1Bnyrd2eZvKYlo2CSV57GLV8\",          \"livemode\": false,          \"period\": {            \"end\": 0,            \"start\": null          },          \"subscription_item\": \"si_18UXa82eZvKYlo2CbYoIEZVv\",          \"total_usage\": 1        }      ]    }    {...}    {...}  ],}\n```\n\n## [Account Links](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_links)\n\nAccount Links are the means by which a Connect platform grants a connected account permission to access Stripe-hosted applications, such as Connect Onboarding.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect Onboarding](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom/hosted-onboarding)\n\n## [Account Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_sessions)\n\nAn AccountSession allows a Connect platform to grant access to a connected account in Connect embedded components.\n\nWe recommend that you create an AccountSession each time you need to display an embedded component to your user. Do not save AccountSessions to your database as they expire relatively quickly, and cannot be used more than once.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect embedded components](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-connect-embedded-components)\n\n## [Application Fees](https://docs.stripe.com/api/application_fees)\n\nWhen you collect a transaction fee on top of a charge made for your user (using [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)), an `Application Fee` object is created in your account. You can list, retrieve, and refund application fees.\n\nRelated guide: [Collecting application fees](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges#collect-fees)\n\n## [Country Specs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/country_specs)\n\nStripe needs to collect certain pieces of information about each account created. These requirements can differ depending on the account’s country. The Country Specs API makes these rules available to your integration.\n\nYou can also view the information from this API call as [an online guide](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information).\n\n## [Person](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/create)[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/update)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/retrieve)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/list)[DELETE/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/delete)\n\n## [Transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/transfers)\n\nA `Transfer` object is created when you move funds between Stripe accounts as part of Connect.\n\nBefore April 6, 2017, transfers also represented movement of funds from a Stripe account to a card or bank account.

If the fee is only partially refunded, this attribute will still be false.\n    \n\n### More attributes\n\n*   #### \n    \n    applicationstringExpandable\n    \n*   #### \n    \n    balance\\_transactionnullable stringExpandable\n    \n\n*   #### \n    \n    fee\\_sourcenullable object\n    \n\n*   #### \n    \n    originating\\_transactionnullable stringExpandable\n    \n\nThe Application Fee object\n\n```\n{  \"id\": \"fee_1B73DOKbnvuxQXGuhY8Aw0TN\",  \"object\": \"application_fee\",  \"account\": \"acct_164wxjKbnvuxQXGu\",  \"amount\": 105,  \"amount_refunded\": 105,  \"application\": \"ca_32D88BD1qLklliziD7gYQvctJIhWBSQ7\",  \"balance_transaction\": \"txn_1032HU2eZvKYlo2CEPtcnUvl\",  \"charge\": \"ch_1B73DOKbnvuxQXGurbwPqzsu\",  \"created\": 1506609734,  \"currency\": \"gbp\",  \"livemode\": false,  \"originating_transaction\": null,  \"refunded\": true,  \"refunds\": {    \"object\": \"list\",    \"data\": [      {        \"id\": \"fr_1MBoV6KbnvuxQXGucP0PaPPO\",        \"object\": \"fee_refund\",        \"amount\": 0,        \"balance_transaction\": null,        \"created\": 1670284508,        \"currency\": \"usd\",        \"fee\": \"fee_1B73DOKbnvuxQXGuhY8Aw0TN\",        \"metadata\": {}      },      {        \"id\": \"fr_1MBoU0KbnvuxQXGu2wCCz4Bb\",        \"object\": \"fee_refund\",        \"amount\": 0,        \"balance_transaction\": null,        \"created\": 1670284441,        \"currency\": \"usd\",        \"fee\": \"fee_1B73DOKbnvuxQXGuhY8Aw0TN\",        \"metadata\": {}      },      {        \"id\": \"fr_1MBoRzKbnvuxQXGuvKkBKkSR\",        \"object\": \"fee_refund\",        \"amount\": 0,        \"balance_transaction\": null,        \"created\": 1670284315,        \"currency\": \"usd\",        \"fee\": \"fee_1B73DOKbnvuxQXGuhY8Aw0TN\",        \"metadata\": {}      },      {        \"id\": \"fr_1MBoPOKbnvuxQXGueOBnke22\",        \"object\": \"fee_refund\",        \"amount\": 0,        \"balance_transaction\": null,        \"created\": 1670284154,        \"currency\": \"usd\",        \"fee\": \"fee_1B73DOKbnvuxQXGuhY8Aw0TN\",        \"metadata\": {}      },      {        \"id\": \"fr_1MBoOGKbnvuxQXGu6EPQI2Zp\",        \"object\": \"fee_refund\",        \"amount\": 0,        \"balance_transaction\": null,        \"created\": 1670284084,        \"currency\": \"usd\",        \"fee\": \"fee_1B73DOKbnvuxQXGuhY8Aw0TN\",        \"metadata\": {}      },      {        \"id\": \"fr_1MBoMUKbnvuxQXGu8Y0Peaoy\",        \"object\": \"fee_refund\",        \"amount\": 0,        \"balance_transaction\": null,        \"created\": 1670283974,        \"currency\": \"usd\",        \"fee\": \"fee_1B73DOKbnvuxQXGuhY8Aw0TN\",        \"metadata\": {}      },      {        \"id\": \"fr_1MAgZBKbnvuxQXGuLTUrgGeq\",        \"object\": \"fee_refund\",        \"amount\": 0,        \"balance_transaction\": null,        \"created\": 1670015681,        \"currency\": \"usd\",        \"fee\": \"fee_1B73DOKbnvuxQXGuhY8Aw0TN\",        \"metadata\": {}      },      {        \"id\": \"fr_1JAu9EKbnvuxQXGuRdZYkxVW\",        \"object\": \"fee_refund\",        \"amount\": 0,        \"balance_transaction\": null,        \"created\": 1625738880,        \"currency\": \"usd\",        \"fee\": \"fee_1B73DOKbnvuxQXGuhY8Aw0TN\",        \"metadata\": {          \"order_id\": \"6735\"        }      },      {        \"id\": \"fr_1HZK0UKbnvuxQXGuS428gH0W\",        \"object\": \"fee_refund\",        \"amount\": 0,        \"balance_transaction\": null,        \"created\": 1602005482,        \"currency\": \"usd\",        \"fee\": \"fee_1B73DOKbnvuxQXGuhY8Aw0TN\",        \"metadata\": {}      },      {        \"id\": \"fr_D0s7fGBKB40Twy\",        \"object\": \"fee_refund\",        \"amount\": 138,        \"balance_transaction\": \"txn_1CaqNg2eZvKYlo2C75cA3Euk\",        \"created\": 1528486576,        \"currency\": \"usd\",        \"fee\": \"fee_1B73DOKbnvuxQXGuhY8Aw0TN\",        \"metadata\": {}      }    ],    \"has_more\": false,    \"url\": \"/v1/application_fees/fee_1B73DOKbnvuxQXGuhY8Aw0TN/refunds\"  },  \"fee_source\": {    \"charge\": \"ch_1B73DOKbnvuxQXGurbwPqzsu\",    \"type\": \"charge\"  }}\n```\n\n## [Retrieve an application fee](https://docs.stripe.com/api/application_fees/retrieve)\n\nRetrieves the details of an application fee that your account has collected.

These requirements can differ depending on the account’s country. The Country Specs API makes these rules available to your integration.\n\nYou can also view the information from this API call as [an online guide](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information).\n\n## [Person](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/create)[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/update)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/retrieve)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/list)[DELETE/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/delete)\n\n## [Transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/transfers)\n\nA `Transfer` object is created when you move funds between Stripe accounts as part of Connect.\n\nBefore April 6, 2017, transfers also represented movement of funds from a Stripe account to a card or bank account. This behavior has since been split out into a [Payout](#payout_object) object, with corresponding payout endpoints. For more information, read about the [transfer/payout split](https://docs.stripe.com/transfer-payout-split).\n\nRelated guide: [Creating separate charges and transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n\n## [Secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/secret_management)\n\nSecret Store is an API that allows Stripe Apps developers to securely persist secrets for use by UI Extensions and app backends.\n\nThe primary resource in Secret Store is a `secret`. Other apps can’t view secrets created by an app. Additionally, secrets are scoped to provide further permission control.\n\nAll Dashboard users and the app backend share `account` scoped secrets. Use the `account` scope for secrets that don’t change per-user, like a third-party API key.\n\nA `user` scoped secret is accessible by the app backend and one specific Dashboard user. Use the `user` scope for per-user secrets like per-user OAuth tokens, where different users might have different permissions.\n\nRelated guide: [Store data between page reloads](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/store-auth-data-custom-objects)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[GET/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/list)[POST/v1/apps/secrets/delete](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/delete)[GET/v1/apps/secrets/find](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/find)[POST/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/set)\n\n## [Reviews](https://docs.stripe.com/api/radar/reviews)\n\nReviews can be used to supplement automated fraud detection with human expertise.\n\nLearn more about [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar) and reviewing payments [here](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/reviews).\n\n## [Authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/update)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/list)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/approve](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/approve)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/decline](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/decline)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_create)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/capture](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_capture)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/expire](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_expire)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/finalize\\_amount](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_finalize_amount)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/increment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_increment)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/fraud\\_challenges/respond](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/respond_to_fraud_challenges)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/reverse](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_reverse)\n\n## [Cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/create)[POST/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/update)[GET/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/list)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/deliver](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_deliver)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/fail](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_fail)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/return](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_return)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/ship](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_ship)\n\n## [Physical Bundles](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/physical_bundles)\n\nA Physical Bundle represents the bundle of physical items -

The webhook contains a `ScheduledQueryRun` object, which you can use to retrieve the query results.\n\n## [Report Types](https://docs.stripe.com/api/reporting/report_type)\n\nThe Report Type resource corresponds to a particular type of report, such as the “Activity summary” or “Itemized payouts” reports. These objects are identified by an ID belonging to a set of enumerated values. See [API Access to Reports documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/reporting/statements/api) for those Report Type IDs, along with required and optional parameters.\n\nNote that certain report types can only be run based on your live-mode data (not test-mode data), and will error when queried without a [live-mode API key](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#test-live-modes).\n\n## [Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/financial_connections/sessions)\n\nA Financial Connections Session is the secure way to programmatically launch the client-side Stripe.js modal that lets your users link their accounts.\n\n## [Verification Report](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_reports)\n\nA VerificationReport is the result of an attempt to collect and verify data from a user. The collection of verification checks performed is determined from the `type` and `options` parameters used. You can find the result of each verification check performed in the appropriate sub-resource: `document`, `id_number`, `selfie`.\n\nEach VerificationReport contains a copy of any data collected by the user as well as reference IDs which can be used to access collected images through the [FileUpload](https://docs.stripe.com/api/files) API. To configure and create VerificationReports, use the [VerificationSession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_sessions) API.\n\nRelated guide: [Accessing verification results](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verification-sessions#results).\n\n## [Crypto Onramp Quotes](https://docs.stripe.com/api/crypto/onramp_quotes)\n\nCrypto Onramp Quotes are estimated quotes for onramp conversions into all the different cryptocurrencies on different networks. The Quotes API allows you to display quotes in your product UI before directing the user to the onramp widget.\n\nRelated guide: [Quotes API](https://docs.stripe.com/crypto/quotes-api)\n\n## [Climate Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/climate/product)\n\nA Climate product represents a type of carbon removal unit available for reservation. You can retrieve it to see the current price and availability.\n\n## [Forwarding Request](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/request)\n\nInstructs Stripe to make a request on your behalf using the destination URL. The destination URL is activated by Stripe at the time of onboarding. Stripe verifies requests with your credentials provided during onboarding, and injects card details from the payment\\_method into the request.\n\nStripe redacts all sensitive fields and headers, including authentication credentials and card numbers, before storing the request and response data in the forwarding Request object, which are subject to a 30-day retention period.\n\nYou can provide a Stripe idempotency key to make sure that requests with the same key result in only one outbound request. The Stripe idempotency key provided should be unique and different from any idempotency keys provided on the underlying third-party request.\n\nForwarding Requests are synchronous requests that return a response or time out according to Stripe’s limits.\n\nRelated guide: [Forward card details to third-party API endpoints](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/forwarding).\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/create)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/retrieve)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/list)",

Do not save AccountSessions to your database as they expire relatively quickly, and cannot be used more than once.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect embedded components](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-connect-embedded-components)\n\n## [Application Fees](https://docs.stripe.com/api/application_fees)\n\nWhen you collect a transaction fee on top of a charge made for your user (using [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)), an `Application Fee` object is created in your account. You can list, retrieve, and refund application fees.\n\nRelated guide: [Collecting application fees](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges#collect-fees)\n\n## [Country Specs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/country_specs)\n\nStripe needs to collect certain pieces of information about each account created. These requirements can differ depending on the account’s country. The Country Specs API makes these rules available to your integration.\n\nYou can also view the information from this API call as [an online guide](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information).\n\n## [Person](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/create)[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/update)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/retrieve)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/list)[DELETE/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/delete)\n\n## [Transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/transfers)\n\nA `Transfer` object is created when you move funds between Stripe accounts as part of Connect.\n\nBefore April 6, 2017, transfers also represented movement of funds from a Stripe account to a card or bank account. This behavior has since been split out into a [Payout](#payout_object) object, with corresponding payout endpoints. For more information, read about the [transfer/payout split](https://docs.stripe.com/transfer-payout-split).\n\nRelated guide: [Creating separate charges and transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n\n## [Secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/secret_management)\n\nSecret Store is an API that allows Stripe Apps developers to securely persist secrets for use by UI Extensions and app backends.\n\nThe primary resource in Secret Store is a `secret`. Other apps can’t view secrets created by an app. Additionally, secrets are scoped to provide further permission control.\n\nAll Dashboard users and the app backend share `account` scoped secrets. Use the `account` scope for secrets that don’t change per-user, like a third-party API key.\n\nA `user` scoped secret is accessible by the app backend and one specific Dashboard user. Use the `user` scope for per-user secrets like per-user OAuth tokens, where different users might have different permissions.\n\nRelated guide: [Store data between page reloads](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/store-auth-data-custom-objects)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[GET/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/list)[POST/v1/apps/secrets/delete](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/delete)[GET/v1/apps/secrets/find](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/find)[POST/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/set)\n\n## [Reviews](https://docs.stripe.com/api/radar/reviews)\n\nReviews can be used to supplement automated fraud detection with human expertise.\n\nLearn more about [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar) and reviewing payments [here](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/reviews).\n\n## [Authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/update)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/list)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/approve](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/approve)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/decline](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/decline)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_create)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/capture](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_capture)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/expire](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_expire)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/finalize\\_amount](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_finalize_amount)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/increment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_increment)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/fraud\\_challenges/respond](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/respond_to_fraud_challenges)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/reverse](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_reverse)\n\n## [Cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/create)[POST/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/update)[GET/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/list)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/deliver](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_deliver)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/fail](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_fail)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/return](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_return)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/ship](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_ship)\n\n## [Physical Bundles](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/physical_bundles)\n\nA Physical Bundle represents the bundle of physical items - card stock, carrier letter, and envelope - that is shipped to a cardholder when you create a physical card.\n\n## [Reader](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/terminal/readers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/create)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/update)[GET/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/retrieve)[GET/v1/terminal/readers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/list)[DELETE/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/delete)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/cancel\\_action](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/cancel_action)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/collect\\_inputs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/collect_inputs)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/confirm\\_payment\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/confirm_payment_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/collect\\_payment\\_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/collect_payment_method)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/process\\_payment\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/process_payment_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/process\\_setup\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/process_setup_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/refund\\_payment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/refund_payment)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/set\\_reader\\_display](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/set_reader_display)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/terminal/readers/:id/present\\_payment\\_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/present_payment_method)\n\n## [Terminal Hardware Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_products)Preview feature\n\nA TerminalHardwareProduct is a category of hardware devices that are generally similar, but may have variations depending on the country it’s shipped to.\n\nTerminalHardwareSKUs represent variations within the same Product (for example, a country specific device). For example, WisePOS E is a TerminalHardwareProduct and a WisePOS E - US and WisePOS E - UK are TerminalHardwareSKUs.\n\n## [Terminal Hardware SKU](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_skus)Preview feature\n\nA TerminalHardwareSKU represents a SKU for Terminal hardware. A SKU is a representation of a product available for purchase, containing information such as the name, price, and images.\n\n## [Transaction Entries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/transaction_entries)\n\nTransactionEntries represent individual units of money movements within a single [Transaction](#transactions).\n\n## [Scheduled Queries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/sigma/scheduled_queries)\n\nIf you have [scheduled a Sigma query](https://docs.stripe.com/sigma/scheduled-queries), you’ll receive a `sigma.scheduled_query_run.created` webhook each time the query runs. The webhook contains a `ScheduledQueryRun` object, which you can use to retrieve the query results.\n\n## [Report Types](https://docs.stripe.com/api/reporting/report_type)\n\nThe Report Type resource corresponds to a particular type of report, such as the “Activity summary” or “Itemized payouts” reports. These objects are identified by an ID belonging to a set of enumerated values. See [API Access to Reports documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/reporting/statements/api) for those Report Type IDs, along with required and optional parameters.\n\nNote that certain report types can only be run based on your live-mode data (not test-mode data), and will error when queried without a [live-mode API key](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#test-live-modes).\n\n## [Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/financial_connections/sessions)\n\nA Financial Connections Session is the secure way to programmatically launch the client-side Stripe.js modal that lets your users link their accounts.\n\n## [Verification Report](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_reports)\n\nA VerificationReport is the result of an attempt to collect and verify data from a user. The collection of verification checks performed is determined from the `type` and `options` parameters used. You can find the result of each verification check performed in the appropriate sub-resource: `document`, `id_number`, `selfie`.\n\nEach VerificationReport contains a copy of any data collected by the user as well as reference IDs which can be used to access collected images through the [FileUpload](https://docs.stripe.com/api/files) API. To configure and create VerificationReports, use the [VerificationSession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_sessions) API.\n\nRelated guide: [Accessing verification results](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verification-sessions#results).\n\n## [Crypto Onramp Quotes](https://docs.stripe.com/api/crypto/onramp_quotes)\n\nCrypto Onramp Quotes are estimated quotes for onramp conversions into all the different cryptocurrencies on different networks. The Quotes API allows you to display quotes in your product UI before directing the user to the onramp widget.\n\nRelated guide: [Quotes API](https://docs.stripe.com/crypto/quotes-api)\n\n## [Climate Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/climate/product)\n\nA Climate product represents a type of carbon removal unit available for reservation.

  "markdown": "# Create a card | Stripe API Reference\n\nWhen you create a new debit card, you must specify a [connected account](#accounts) to create it on. You can only specify connected accounts where [account.controller.requirement\\_collection](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-controller-requirement_collection) is `application` (includes [Custom accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom-accounts)).\n\nIf the account has no default destination card, then the new card will become the default. However, if the owner already has a default then it will not change. To change the default, you should set `default_for_currency` to `true`.\n\n### Parameters\n\n*   #### \n    \n    external\\_accountobject | stringRequired\n    \n    A token, like the ones returned by [Stripe.js](https://docs.stripe.com/js) or a dictionary containing a user’s card details (with the options shown below).

Do not save AccountSessions to your database as they expire relatively quickly, and cannot be used more than once.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect embedded components](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-connect-embedded-components)\n\n## [Application Fees](https://docs.stripe.com/api/application_fees)\n\nWhen you collect a transaction fee on top of a charge made for your user (using [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)), an `Application Fee` object is created in your account. You can list, retrieve, and refund application fees.\n\nRelated guide: [Collecting application fees](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges#collect-fees)\n\n## [Country Specs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/country_specs)\n\nStripe needs to collect certain pieces of information about each account created. These requirements can differ depending on the account’s country. The Country Specs API makes these rules available to your integration.\n\nYou can also view the information from this API call as [an online guide](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information).\n\n## [Person](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/create)[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/update)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/retrieve)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/list)[DELETE/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/delete)\n\n## [Transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/transfers)\n\nA `Transfer` object is created when you move funds between Stripe accounts as part of Connect.\n\nBefore April 6, 2017, transfers also represented movement of funds from a Stripe account to a card or bank account. This behavior has since been split out into a [Payout](#payout_object) object, with corresponding payout endpoints. For more information, read about the [transfer/payout split](https://docs.stripe.com/transfer-payout-split).\n\nRelated guide: [Creating separate charges and transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n\n## [Secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/secret_management)\n\nSecret Store is an API that allows Stripe Apps developers to securely persist secrets for use by UI Extensions and app backends.\n\nThe primary resource in Secret Store is a `secret`. Other apps can’t view secrets created by an app. Additionally, secrets are scoped to provide further permission control.\n\nAll Dashboard users and the app backend share `account` scoped secrets. Use the `account` scope for secrets that don’t change per-user, like a third-party API key.\n\nA `user` scoped secret is accessible by the app backend and one specific Dashboard user. Use the `user` scope for per-user secrets like per-user OAuth tokens, where different users might have different permissions.\n\nRelated guide: [Store data between page reloads](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/store-auth-data-custom-objects)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[GET/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/list)[POST/v1/apps/secrets/delete](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/delete)[GET/v1/apps/secrets/find](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/find)[POST/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/set)\n\n## [Reviews](https://docs.stripe.com/api/radar/reviews)\n\nReviews can be used to supplement automated fraud detection with human expertise.\n\nLearn more about [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar) and reviewing payments [here](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/reviews).\n\n## [Authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/update)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/list)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/approve](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/approve)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/decline](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/decline)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_create)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/capture](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_capture)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/expire](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_expire)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/finalize\\_amount](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_finalize_amount)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/increment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_increment)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/fraud\\_challenges/respond](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/respond_to_fraud_challenges)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/reverse](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_reverse)\n\n## [Cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/create)[POST/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/update)[GET/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/list)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/deliver](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_deliver)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/fail](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_fail)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/return](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_return)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/ship](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_ship)\n\n## [Physical Bundles](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/physical_bundles)\n\nA Physical Bundle represents the bundle of physical items -

For example, WisePOS E is a TerminalHardwareProduct and a WisePOS E - US and WisePOS E - UK are TerminalHardwareSKUs.\n\n## [Terminal Hardware SKU](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_skus)Preview feature\n\nA TerminalHardwareSKU represents a SKU for Terminal hardware. A SKU is a representation of a product available for purchase, containing information such as the name, price, and images.\n\n## [Transaction Entries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/transaction_entries)\n\nTransactionEntries represent individual units of money movements within a single [Transaction](#transactions).\n\n## [Scheduled Queries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/sigma/scheduled_queries)\n\nIf you have [scheduled a Sigma query](https://docs.stripe.com/sigma/scheduled-queries), you’ll receive a `sigma.scheduled_query_run.created` webhook each time the query runs. The webhook contains a `ScheduledQueryRun` object, which you can use to retrieve the query results.\n\n## [Report Types](https://docs.stripe.com/api/reporting/report_type)\n\nThe Report Type resource corresponds to a particular type of report, such as the “Activity summary” or “Itemized payouts” reports. These objects are identified by an ID belonging to a set of enumerated values. See [API Access to Reports documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/reporting/statements/api) for those Report Type IDs, along with required and optional parameters.\n\nNote that certain report types can only be run based on your live-mode data (not test-mode data), and will error when queried without a [live-mode API key](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#test-live-modes).\n\n## [Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/financial_connections/sessions)\n\nA Financial Connections Session is the secure way to programmatically launch the client-side Stripe.js modal that lets your users link their accounts.\n\n## [Verification Report](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_reports)\n\nA VerificationReport is the result of an attempt to collect and verify data from a user. The collection of verification checks performed is determined from the `type` and `options` parameters used. You can find the result of each verification check performed in the appropriate sub-resource: `document`, `id_number`, `selfie`.\n\nEach VerificationReport contains a copy of any data collected by the user as well as reference IDs which can be used to access collected images through the [FileUpload](https://docs.stripe.com/api/files) API. To configure and create VerificationReports, use the [VerificationSession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_sessions) API.\n\nRelated guide: [Accessing verification results](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verification-sessions#results).\n\n## [Crypto Onramp Quotes](https://docs.stripe.com/api/crypto/onramp_quotes)\n\nCrypto Onramp Quotes are estimated quotes for onramp conversions into all the different cryptocurrencies on different networks. The Quotes API allows you to display quotes in your product UI before directing the user to the onramp widget.\n\nRelated guide: [Quotes API](https://docs.stripe.com/crypto/quotes-api)\n\n## [Climate Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/climate/product)\n\nA Climate product represents a type of carbon removal unit available for reservation.

Do not save AccountSessions to your database as they expire relatively quickly, and cannot be used more than once.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect embedded components](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-connect-embedded-components)\n\n## [Application Fees](https://docs.stripe.com/api/application_fees)\n\nWhen you collect a transaction fee on top of a charge made for your user (using [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)), an `Application Fee` object is created in your account. You can list, retrieve, and refund application fees.\n\nRelated guide: [Collecting application fees](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges#collect-fees)\n\n## [Country Specs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/country_specs)\n\nStripe needs to collect certain pieces of information about each account created. These requirements can differ depending on the account’s country. The Country Specs API makes these rules available to your integration.\n\nYou can also view the information from this API call as [an online guide](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information).\n\n## [Person](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/create)[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/update)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/retrieve)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/list)[DELETE/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/delete)\n\n## [Transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/transfers)\n\nA `Transfer` object is created when you move funds between Stripe accounts as part of Connect.\n\nBefore April 6, 2017, transfers also represented movement of funds from a Stripe account to a card or bank account. This behavior has since been split out into a [Payout](#payout_object) object, with corresponding payout endpoints. For more information, read about the [transfer/payout split](https://docs.stripe.com/transfer-payout-split).\n\nRelated guide: [Creating separate charges and transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n\n## [Secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/secret_management)\n\nSecret Store is an API that allows Stripe Apps developers to securely persist secrets for use by UI Extensions and app backends.\n\nThe primary resource in Secret Store is a `secret`. Other apps can’t view secrets created by an app. Additionally, secrets are scoped to provide further permission control.\n\nAll Dashboard users and the app backend share `account` scoped secrets. Use the `account` scope for secrets that don’t change per-user, like a third-party API key.\n\nA `user` scoped secret is accessible by the app backend and one specific Dashboard user. Use the `user` scope for per-user secrets like per-user OAuth tokens, where different users might have different permissions.\n\nRelated guide: [Store data between page reloads](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/store-auth-data-custom-objects)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[GET/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/list)[POST/v1/apps/secrets/delete](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/delete)[GET/v1/apps/secrets/find](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/find)[POST/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/set)\n\n## [Reviews](https://docs.stripe.com/api/radar/reviews)\n\nReviews can be used to supplement automated fraud detection with human expertise.\n\nLearn more about [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar) and reviewing payments [here](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/reviews).\n\n## [Authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/update)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/list)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/approve](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/approve)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/decline](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/decline)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_create)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/capture](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_capture)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/expire](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_expire)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/finalize\\_amount](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_finalize_amount)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/increment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_increment)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/fraud\\_challenges/respond](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/respond_to_fraud_challenges)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/reverse](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_reverse)\n\n## [Cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/create)[POST/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/update)[GET/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/list)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/deliver](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_deliver)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/fail](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_fail)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/return](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_return)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/ship](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_ship)\n\n## [Physical Bundles](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/physical_bundles)\n\nA Physical Bundle represents the bundle of physical items - card stock, carrier letter, and envelope - that is shipped to a cardholder when you create a physical card.\n\n## [Reader](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/terminal/readers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/create)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/update)[GET/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/retrieve)[GET/v1/terminal/readers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/list)[DELETE/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/delete)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/cancel\\_action](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/cancel_action)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/collect\\_inputs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/collect_inputs)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/confirm\\_payment\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/confirm_payment_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/collect\\_payment\\_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/collect_payment_method)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/process\\_payment\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/process_payment_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/process\\_setup\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/process_setup_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/refund\\_payment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/refund_payment)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/set\\_reader\\_display](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/set_reader_display)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/terminal/readers/:id/present\\_payment\\_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/present_payment_method)\n\n## [Terminal Hardware Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_products)Preview feature\n\nA TerminalHardwareProduct is a category of hardware devices that are generally similar, but may have variations depending on the country it’s shipped to.\n\nTerminalHardwareSKUs represent variations within the same Product (for example, a country specific device). For example, WisePOS E is a TerminalHardwareProduct and a WisePOS E - US and WisePOS E - UK are TerminalHardwareSKUs.\n\n## [Terminal Hardware SKU](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_skus)Preview feature\n\nA TerminalHardwareSKU represents a SKU for Terminal hardware. A SKU is a representation of a product available for purchase, containing information such as the name, price, and images.\n\n## [Transaction Entries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/transaction_entries)\n\nTransactionEntries represent individual units of money movements within a single [Transaction](#transactions).\n\n## [Scheduled Queries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/sigma/scheduled_queries)\n\nIf you have [scheduled a Sigma query](https://docs.stripe.com/sigma/scheduled-queries), you’ll receive a `sigma.scheduled_query_run.created` webhook each time the query runs. The webhook contains a `ScheduledQueryRun` object, which you can use to retrieve the query results.\n\n## [Report Types](https://docs.stripe.com/api/reporting/report_type)\n\nThe Report Type resource corresponds to a particular type of report, such as the “Activity summary” or “Itemized payouts” reports. These objects are identified by an ID belonging to a set of enumerated values. See [API Access to Reports documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/reporting/statements/api) for those Report Type IDs, along with required and optional parameters.\n\nNote that certain report types can only be run based on your live-mode data (not test-mode data), and will error when queried without a [live-mode API key](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#test-live-modes).\n\n## [Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/financial_connections/sessions)\n\nA Financial Connections Session is the secure way to programmatically launch the client-side Stripe.js modal that lets your users link their accounts.\n\n## [Verification Report](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_reports)\n\nA VerificationReport is the result of an attempt to collect and verify data from a user. The collection of verification checks performed is determined from the `type` and `options` parameters used. You can find the result of each verification check performed in the appropriate sub-resource: `document`, `id_number`, `selfie`.\n\nEach VerificationReport contains a copy of any data collected by the user as well as reference IDs which can be used to access collected images through the [FileUpload](https://docs.stripe.com/api/files) API. To configure and create VerificationReports, use the [VerificationSession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_sessions) API.\n\nRelated guide: [Accessing verification results](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verification-sessions#results).\n\n## [Crypto Onramp Quotes](https://docs.stripe.com/api/crypto/onramp_quotes)\n\nCrypto Onramp Quotes are estimated quotes for onramp conversions into all the different cryptocurrencies on different networks. The Quotes API allows you to display quotes in your product UI before directing the user to the onramp widget.\n\nRelated guide: [Quotes API](https://docs.stripe.com/crypto/quotes-api)\n\n## [Climate Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/climate/product)\n\nA Climate product represents a type of carbon removal unit available for reservation. You can retrieve it to see the current price and availability.\n\n## [Forwarding Request](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/request)\n\nInstructs Stripe to make a request on your behalf using the destination URL.

  "markdown": "# Manage locations | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Group and manage your readers by physical location.\n\nYou can streamline the management of multiple readers across different physical sites by using locations and zones.\n\nLocations and zones help by associating each reader with specific operational sites and guarantee that the correct regional configurations are downloaded.\n\n*   **Locations**: Allows you to group readers, monitor their connectivity status, and modify your settings based on physical location. This functionality is beneficial for marketplaces with multiple connected accounts.\n    \n*   **Zones**: Offers an optional method to further categorize locations and readers. Zones enable you to represent broader groups of readers or locations, such as larger geographic regions (for example, countries) or organizational sub-brands. Multiple locations can belong to a single zone, and you can create a hierarchical structure by grouping multiple zones under a single zone.\n    \n\n#### Note\n\nZones provide an additional way to group locations. You must still assign readers to a location, and you can assign a location to only one zone.\n\n## Locations ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nYou can create a location for each physical place where your readers operate. You can [register](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/fleet/register-readers) multiple readers to each location, and nest these locations within zones. Before you can use a reader, you must register it to a location.\n\nThe required [address properties](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/locations/create#create_terminal_location-address) for a location vary by country:\n\n| Countries | Required Address Properties |\n| --- | --- |\n| Australia<br><br>Canada<br><br>Italy<br><br>Spain<br><br>United States | `line1`, `city`, `state`, `postal_code`, and `country` |\n| Austria+<br><br>Belgium<br><br>Czech Republic+<br><br>Denmark<br><br>Finland+<br><br>France<br><br>Germany<br><br>Luxembourg+<br><br>Malaysia+<br><br>Netherlands<br><br>New Zealand+<br><br>Norway+<br><br>Portugal+<br><br>Sweden<br><br>Switzerland+<br><br>United Kingdom | `line1`, `city`, `postal_code`, and `country` |\n| Ireland<br><br>Singapore | `line1`, `postal_code`, and `country` |\n\n+Terminal is currently in beta in this country.\n\n\\*\\*Compatibility for this mobile SDK also applies when used with React Native.\n\n#### Common mistake\n\nYou can use the Dashboard or API to update a `Location` object. If you do so, avoid changing the country associated with an existing location. Instead of changing the country, create a new location in a different country, and then re-register any readers associated with the old location.\n\n## Zones ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nZones are the top-level groups that can consist of either more zones or locations. You can add more zones nested under an existing one, creating additional hierarchy levels, such as “West coast.” However, organizing your locations into zones is optional.\n\n## Create locations and zones ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\n#### Note\n\nYou can’t create or modify zones using the API.\n\nFirst, you must [register your reader to a location](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/fleet/register-readers?dashboard-or-api=api) to accept payments.\n\nTo create a new Terminal [Location](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/locations) object using the API, use the [create location](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/locations/create) request.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/terminal/locations \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d display_name=HQ \\  -d \"address[line1]\"=\"1272 Valencia Street\" \\  -d \"address[city]\"=\"San Francisco\" \\  -d \"address[state]\"=CA \\  -d \"address[country]\"=US \\  -d \"address[postal_code]\"=94110`\n\n### Create a location for accounts using direct charges![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nTo create a Location for an account using [direct charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges), use the `Stripe-Account` header in your request. Only the Connect account you authenticate as can access these locations. If the business operates in multiple physical sites, you can create multiple Locations for any individual accounts with direct charges.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/terminal/locations \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -H \"Stripe-Account:   {{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}  \" \\  -d display_name=HQ \\  -d \"address[line1]\"=\"1272 Valencia Street\" \\  -d \"address[city]\"=\"San Francisco\" \\  -d \"address[state]\"=CA \\  -d \"address[country]\"=US \\  -d \"address[postal_code]\"=94110`\n\n### Create a location for accounts using destination charges![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nFor integrations using [destination charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges), Locations belong to the _platform_ account and aren’t mapped strictly to connected accounts. If your platform needs to associate accounts using destination charges with Locations, you can store a reference to the relevant account(s) in the Location’s [metadata](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/locations/object#terminal_location_object-metadata) property.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/terminal/locations \\   -u` \n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`: \\   -d \"display_name\"=\"HQ\" \\   -d \"address[line1]\"=\"1272 Valencia Street\" \\   -d \"address[city]\"=\"San Francisco\" \\   -d \"address[state]\"=\"CA\" \\   -d \"address[country]\"=\"US\" \\   -d \"address[postal_code]\"=\"94110\" \\   -d \"metadata[connected_account]\"=  {{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}    `\n\nWhen you [register your reader to a Location](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/fleet/register-readers), the specified Location groups the reader and defines its country settings.\n\n## Scope connection tokens Server-side Smart readers ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nWhen creating a [ConnectionToken](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/connection_tokens) for the Terminal SDK, you can provide a `location` parameter to control access to smart readers. If you provide a Location, the ConnectionToken is only usable with smart readers assigned to that Location. If you don’t provide a Location, the ConnectionToken is usable with all readers.\n\n#### Note\n\nFor Bluetooth readers, the `location` of a ConnectionToken has no effect. This ensures that any nearby Bluetooth readers remain discoverable.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/terminal/connection_tokens \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d location=  {{LOCATION_ID}}    `",

For example, WisePOS E is a TerminalHardwareProduct and a WisePOS E - US and WisePOS E - UK are TerminalHardwareSKUs.\n\n## [Terminal Hardware SKU](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_skus)Preview feature\n\nA TerminalHardwareSKU represents a SKU for Terminal hardware. A SKU is a representation of a product available for purchase, containing information such as the name, price, and images.\n\n## [Transaction Entries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/transaction_entries)\n\nTransactionEntries represent individual units of money movements within a single [Transaction](#transactions).\n\n## [Scheduled Queries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/sigma/scheduled_queries)\n\nIf you have [scheduled a Sigma query](https://docs.stripe.com/sigma/scheduled-queries), you’ll receive a `sigma.scheduled_query_run.created` webhook each time the query runs. The webhook contains a `ScheduledQueryRun` object, which you can use to retrieve the query results.\n\n## [Report Types](https://docs.stripe.com/api/reporting/report_type)\n\nThe Report Type resource corresponds to a particular type of report, such as the “Activity summary” or “Itemized payouts” reports. These objects are identified by an ID belonging to a set of enumerated values. See [API Access to Reports documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/reporting/statements/api) for those Report Type IDs, along with required and optional parameters.\n\nNote that certain report types can only be run based on your live-mode data (not test-mode data), and will error when queried without a [live-mode API key](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#test-live-modes).\n\n## [Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/financial_connections/sessions)\n\nA Financial Connections Session is the secure way to programmatically launch the client-side Stripe.js modal that lets your users link their accounts.\n\n## [Verification Report](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_reports)\n\nA VerificationReport is the result of an attempt to collect and verify data from a user. The collection of verification checks performed is determined from the `type` and `options` parameters used. You can find the result of each verification check performed in the appropriate sub-resource: `document`, `id_number`, `selfie`.\n\nEach VerificationReport contains a copy of any data collected by the user as well as reference IDs which can be used to access collected images through the [FileUpload](https://docs.stripe.com/api/files) API. To configure and create VerificationReports, use the [VerificationSession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_sessions) API.\n\nRelated guide: [Accessing verification results](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verification-sessions#results).\n\n## [Crypto Onramp Quotes](https://docs.stripe.com/api/crypto/onramp_quotes)\n\nCrypto Onramp Quotes are estimated quotes for onramp conversions into all the different cryptocurrencies on different networks. The Quotes API allows you to display quotes in your product UI before directing the user to the onramp widget.\n\nRelated guide: [Quotes API](https://docs.stripe.com/crypto/quotes-api)\n\n## [Climate Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/climate/product)\n\nA Climate product represents a type of carbon removal unit available for reservation. You can retrieve it to see the current price and availability.\n\n## [Forwarding Request](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/request)\n\nInstructs Stripe to make a request on your behalf using the destination URL. The destination URL is activated by Stripe at the time of onboarding. Stripe verifies requests with your credentials provided during onboarding, and injects card details from the payment\\_method into the request.\n\nStripe redacts all sensitive fields and headers, including authentication credentials and card numbers, before storing the request and response data in the forwarding Request object, which are subject to a 30-day retention period.\n\nYou can provide a Stripe idempotency key to make sure that requests with the same key result in only one outbound request. The Stripe idempotency key provided should be unique and different from any idempotency keys provided on the underlying third-party request.\n\nForwarding Requests are synchronous requests that return a response or time out according to Stripe’s limits.\n\nRelated guide: [Forward card details to third-party API endpoints](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/forwarding).\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/create)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/retrieve)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/list)",

the “Activity summary” or “Itemized payouts” reports. These objects are identified by an ID belonging to a set of enumerated values. See [API Access to Reports documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/reporting/statements/api) for those Report Type IDs, along with required and optional parameters.\n\nNote that certain report types can only be run based on your live-mode data (not test-mode data), and will error when queried without a [live-mode API key](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#test-live-modes).\n\n## [Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/financial_connections/sessions)\n\nA Financial Connections Session is the secure way to programmatically launch the client-side Stripe.js modal that lets your users link their accounts.\n\n## [Verification Report](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_reports)\n\nA VerificationReport is the result of an attempt to collect and verify data from a user. The collection of verification checks performed is determined from the `type` and `options` parameters used. You can find the result of each verification check performed in the appropriate sub-resource: `document`, `id_number`, `selfie`.\n\nEach VerificationReport contains a copy of any data collected by the user as well as reference IDs which can be used to access collected images through the [FileUpload](https://docs.stripe.com/api/files) API. To configure and create VerificationReports, use the [VerificationSession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_sessions) API.\n\nRelated guide: [Accessing verification results](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verification-sessions#results).\n\n## [Crypto Onramp Quotes](https://docs.stripe.com/api/crypto/onramp_quotes)\n\nCrypto Onramp Quotes are estimated quotes for onramp conversions into all the different cryptocurrencies on different networks. The Quotes API allows you to display quotes in your product UI before directing the user to the onramp widget.\n\nRelated guide: [Quotes API](https://docs.stripe.com/crypto/quotes-api)\n\n## [Climate Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/climate/product)\n\nA Climate product represents a type of carbon removal unit available for reservation. You can retrieve it to see the current price and availability.\n\n## [Forwarding Request](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/request)\n\nInstructs Stripe to make a request on your behalf using the destination URL. The destination URL is activated by Stripe at the time of onboarding. Stripe verifies requests with your credentials provided during onboarding, and injects card details from the payment\\_method into the request.\n\nStripe redacts all sensitive fields and headers, including authentication credentials and card numbers, before storing the request and response data in the forwarding Request object, which are subject to a 30-day retention period.\n\nYou can provide a Stripe idempotency key to make sure that requests with the same key result in only one outbound request. The Stripe idempotency key provided should be unique and different from any idempotency keys provided on the underlying third-party request.\n\nForwarding Requests are synchronous requests that return a response or time out according to Stripe’s limits.\n\nRelated guide: [Forward card details to third-party API endpoints](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/forwarding).\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/create)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/retrieve)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/list)",

Stripe also handles all regulatory requirements, [know your customer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_your_customer \"know your customer\") (KYC) verifications, and sanctions screening. Customers have the option of saving payment methods, KYC data, and wallet information with Stripe, which makes the returning onramp experience much faster.\n\nYou must submit an onramp application to access the onramp API. Most applications are reviewed within 48 hours.\n\n### To submit your application:![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n1.  Create or sign in to your Stripe account, and submit the [onramp application](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register?redirect=%2Fcrypto-onramp%2Fapplication).\n2.  Complete your [Stripe application](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/onboarding).\n3.  After submitting the application in step 2, you can start development using test mode.\n\nStripe notifies you when your application is approved or if we require more information. Check the status of your application at any time by visiting the [onboarding page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/crypto-onramp/onboarding).\n\nPlease reach out to support@stripe.com with any questions.\n\n![An example of Stripe's fiat-to-crypto onramp being embedded into a 3rd party application](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/crypto-onramp-overview.c9ec889d4c12403f4b2dbc17600dc640.png)\n\nAn example of Stripe’s fiat-to-crypto onramp being embedded into a 3rd party application\n\n## Integration Options![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nStripe provides multiple ways for your application to integrate with the onramp.

  "markdown": "# Backend integration recipes | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Backend integration recipesBeta\n\n## Learn best practices for integrating the onramp for different web3 use cases.\n\nTo optimize the user experience, frame the onramp as a native component of your application. In addition to frontend design, you often want to pre-populate onramp parameters when creating an onramp session in the backend. The following are some common use cases and suggested implementations.\n\n### Wallet![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nWallet users have two main onramp entry points—wallet funding and transaction top up.\n\n#### 1\\. Wallet funding![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYou can proactively prompt users to fund their wallet after they create a new wallet or when their funds are critically low.\n\nIn these cases, you might want to specify the following:\n\n*   `wallet_addresses`: Use the wallet address already in use.\n*   `destination_networks`: Set to the default or selected network to reduce user confusion.\n*   `destination_currencies`: Leaving this blank is acceptable but you can optionally restrict it to the native gas token or any desired cryptocurrencies (for example, if you offer a Defi service in USDC, consider the case where the user likely needs both USDC and the gas token).\n*   `destination_network`: Leave this blank to inherit first value of supported network.\n*   `destination_currency`: Leave this blank to inherit first value of supported cryptocurrencies.\n\n`curl -X POST https://api.stripe.com/v1/crypto/onramp_sessions \\   -u` \n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`: \\   -d \"customer_ip_address\"=\"8.8.8.8\" \\   -d \"wallet_addresses[ethereum]\"=\"0xB00F0759DbeeF5E543Cc3E3B07A6442F5f3928a2\" \\   -d \"wallet_addresses[solana]\"=\"bufoH37MTiMTNAfBS4VEZ94dCEwMsmeSijD2vZRShuV\" \\   -d \"destination_networks[]\"=\"ethereum\" \\   -d \"destination_networks[]\"=\"solana\"`\n\n#### 2\\. Transaction top-up![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nWhen a Dapp or the user proposes a transaction, you might detect that the transaction fails because of insufficient funds. In this case, you can calculate the delta required for the transaction to complete. However, it’s often difficult to detect the requested amount or cryptocurrency for ERC or SPL tokens.\n\nIn these cases, you might want to specify the following:\n\n*   `wallet_addresses`: Use the wallet address in use\n*   `destination_networks`: Set to the selected network\n*   `destination_currencies`: Restrict to the missing currencies when possible\n*   `destination_network`: Set to the selected network (a required value if you want to set the amount)\n*   `destination_currency`: Set to the target currency (a required value if you want to set the amount)\n*   `destination_amount`: Set to the balance differences and leave enough buffer room for gas when applicable\n\n`curl -X POST https://api.stripe.com/v1/crypto/onramp_sessions \\   -u` \n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`: \\   -d \"customer_ip_address\"=\"8.8.8.8\" \\   -d \"wallet_addresses[ethereum]\"=\"0xB00F0759DbeeF5E543Cc3E3B07A6442F5f3928a2\" \\   -d \"destination_networks[]\"=\"ethereum\" \\   -d \"destination_currencies[]\"=\"usdc\" \\   -d \"destination_network\"=\"ethereum\" \\   -d \"destination_currency\"=\"usdc\" \\   -d \"destination_amount\"=\"10\"`\n\n### Dapp or NFT checkout![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nIn some applications, you can use the onramp in checkout when you know what the destination amount is. For example, a Dapp might be used to sell memberships for a fixed price, or when the user is looking to buy a specific NFT from a marketplace.\n\nIn these cases, you might want to specify the following:\n\n*   `wallet_addresses`—Use the connected wallet address\n*   `destination_networks`—Use the connected network\n*   `destination_currencies`—Use the presentment currency (that is, the price in the currency the goods are quoted in)\n*   `destination_network`—Set to the selected network above (a required value if you want to set the amount)\n*   `destination_currency`—Set to the target currency above (a required value if you want to set amount)\n*   `destination_amount`—Set it to either the balance difference or to cover the entire purchase amount. Some users adopt both using on-chain analytics with just about an even split. A user might choose the full amount to simplify their tax cost basis or to not spend accumulated assets. In both cases, you should leave room for gas.\n\n`curl -X POST https://api.stripe.com/v1/crypto/onramp_sessions \\   -u` \n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`: \\   -d \"customer_ip_address\"=\"8.8.8.8\" \\   -d \"wallet_addresses[ethereum]\"=\"0xB00F0759DbeeF5E543Cc3E3B07A6442F5f3928a2\" \\   -d \"destination_networks[]\"=\"ethereum\" \\   -d \"destination_currencies[]\"=\"eth\" \\   -d \"destination_network\"=\"ethereum\" \\   -d \"destination_currency\"=\"eth\" \\   -d \"destination_amount\"=\"0.2343\"`\n\n### DEX![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nA DEX presents a unique opportunity to let users buy any cryptocurrency with fiat. While a DEX can incrementally prompt users to top up crypto when exchanging arbitrary crypto pairs using an existing interface, it’s preferable to have a dedicated user flow that focuses on fiat to crypto only.\n\nAs the onramp lets you own your brand and user experience, a DEX can build an onramp widget that takes advantage of Stripe’s ability to process fiat into selective cryptocurrencies, and DEX can complete the final leg exchanging it to arbitrary currencies. A DEX can also build an onramp widget for a specific token. For example, a DAO might endorse a specific liquidity pool and use a DEX to distribute their tokens and onboard new users with fiat.\n\nIn these cases, you might want to specify the following\n\n*   `wallet_addresses`—Use the wallet address already in use\n*   `destination_networks`—Set to the selected network\n*   `destination_currencies`—Restrict to the selected cryptocurrency\n*   `destination_network`—Set to selected network (a required value if you want to set the amount)\n*   `destination_currency`—Set to the target currency (a required value if you want to set the amount)\n*   `destination_amount`—Set only if you can collect the user’s intent ahead of time—leave blank for Stripe to suggest smart default values\n\n`curl -X POST https://api.stripe.com/v1/crypto/onramp_sessions \\   -u` \n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`: \\   -d \"customer_ip_address\"=\"8.8.8.8\" \\   -d \"wallet_addresses[ethereum]\"=\"0xB00F0759DbeeF5E543Cc3E3B07A6442F5f3928a2\" \\   -d \"destination_networks[]\"=\"ethereum\" \\   -d \"destination_currencies[]\"=\"eth\" \\   -d \"destination_network\"=\"ethereum\" \\   -d \"destination_currency\"=\"eth\"`",

Don’t include the scripts in a bundle or host a copy yourself. If you do, your integration might break without warning.\n\nGenerate a redirect URL using the `Standalone` function, passing in desired parameters:\n\n`const standaloneOnramp = window.StripeOnramp.Standalone({   source_currency: 'usd',   amount: {source_amount: '42'},   destination_networks: ['ethereum', 'bitcoin'],   destination_currencies: ['eth', 'btc'],   destination_currency: 'btc',   destination_network: 'bitcoin' }); const redirectUrl = standaloneOnramp.getUrl();`\n\nWe allow the following parameters to be pre-populated:\n\n*   `source_currency`: The fiat currency for the transaction (`usd` and `eur` only for now).\n*   `amount`: The fixed amount of fiat currency or cryptocurrency for this purchase. Specify a fiat amount by passing in `source_amount` (for example, `{source_amount: 42}`). Specify a cryptocurrency amount by passing in `destination_amount` (for example, `{destination_amount: 42}`). You can only specify one amount.\n*   `destination_currencies`: An array of cryptocurrencies you want to restrict to (for example, `[eth, usdc]`).\n*   `destination_networks`: An array of crypto networks you want to restrict to (for example, `[ethereum, polygon]`).\n*   `destination_network`: The default crypto network for this onramp (for example, `ethereum`).\n*   `destination_currency`: The default cryptocurrency for this onramp session (for example, `eth`).\n\nRedirect your users to the URL for a prebuilt frontend integration of the crypto onramp on the standalone hosted onramp.\n\n## Mint a session with a redirect URL![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nSimilar to other integrations, you need to implement a server endpoint to [create a new onramp session](https://docs.stripe.com/crypto/using-the-api) for every user visit. The onramp session creation request returns a `redirect_url`. Redirect your users to the URL for a fully customized and branded crypto onramp on the standalone hosted onramp.\n\nGenerate a [crypto onramp session](https://docs.stripe.com/crypto/using-the-api#api-reference) with a `redirect_url` by running the following curl command in your terminal:\n\n`curl -X POST https://api.stripe.com/v1/crypto/onramp_sessions \\   -u` \n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:`\n\nSample response:\n\n`{   \"id\": \"cos_0MpKNb589O8KAxCGjmaOVF8T\",   \"object\": \"crypto.onramp_session\",   \"client_secret\": \"cos_0MpKNb589O8KAxCGjmaOVF8T_secret_fqV1TAdhSCFeO9FW5HnygRXca00AwEHIOu8\",   \"created\": 1679701843,   \"livemode\": false,   \"redirect_url\": \"[https://crypto.link.com?session_hash=CCwaGwoZYWNjdF8yOERUNTg5TzhLQXhDR2JMbXh5WijU7vigBjIGmyBbkqO4Oi10eFHEaFln9gFSsTGQBoQf5qRZK-A0NhiEIeH3QaCMrz-d4oYotirrAd_Bkz4](https://crypto.link.com/?session_hash=CCwaGwoZYWNjdF8yOERUNTg5TzhLQXhDR2JMbXh5WijU7vigBjIGmyBbkqO4Oi10eFHEaFln9gFSsTGQBoQf5qRZK-A0NhiEIeH3QaCMrz-d4oYotirrAd_Bkz4)\",   \"status\": \"initialized\",   \"transaction_details\": {     \"destination_currency\": null,     \"destination_amount\": null,     \"destination_network\": null,     \"fees\": null,     \"lock_wallet_address\": false,     \"source_currency\": null,     \"source_amount\": null,     \"destination_currencies\": [       \"btc\",       \"eth\",       \"sol\",       \"usdc\",       \"xlm\"     ],     \"destination_networks\": [       \"bitcoin\",       \"ethereum\",       \"solana\",       \"polygon\",       \"stellar\"     ],     \"transaction_id\": null,     \"wallet_address\": null,     \"wallet_addresses\": null   } }`",

Onboard onto Stripe and get API keys\n\nGo to the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys) and get:\n\n*   The [secret key](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#obtain-api-keys) that you need to make API calls to Stripe from a server you control\n*   The [publishable key](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#obtain-api-keys) that you use to make requests from your frontend client\n\n1.  Generate a CryptoOnrampSession server-side\n\nOn a server you control, expose a new API endpoint (for example, `myserver.com/mint-onramp-session`) which makes a call to the Stripe `POST /v1/crypto/onramp_sessions` endpoint. This “mints” an onramp session with Stripe that you can use with new or returning users. You need to mint one session per user.\n\nThe request:\n\n`curl -X POST https://api.stripe.com/v1/crypto/onramp_sessions \\   -u` \n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:`\n\nThe response:\n\n`{   \"id\": \"cos_0MYvmj589O8KAxCGp14dTjiw\",   \"object\": \"crypto.onramp_session\",   \"client_secret\": \"cos_0MYvmj589O8KAxCGp14dTjiw_secret_BsxEqQLiYKANcTAoVnJ2ikH5q002b9xzouk\",   \"created\": 1675794053,   \"livemode\": false,   \"status\": \"initialized\",   \"transaction_details\": {     \"destination_currency\": null,     \"destination_amount\": null,     \"destination_network\": null,     \"fees\": null,     \"lock_wallet_address\": false,     \"source_currency\": null,     \"source_amount\": null,     \"destination_currencies\": [       \"btc\",       \"eth\",       \"sol\",       \"usdc\",       \"xlm\"     ],     \"destination_networks\": [       \"bitcoin\",       \"ethereum\",       \"solana\",       \"stellar\"     ],     \"transaction_id\": null,     \"wallet_address\": null,     \"wallet_addresses\": null   } }`\n\nThis endpoint returns error codes if Stripe can’t create onramp sessions. See the supportability section below to learn why this might happen.\n\n#### Note\n\nFor an optimal user experience, render the onramp component conditional when a user gets an HTTP status `200` during session creation and provide a fallback UI that can deal with session creation errors.\n\n1.  Use the session client\\_secret in the frontend\n\nTo initialize the onramp component you’ll need:\n\n*   Your publishable API key from step 1\n*   The client\\_secret from your request to `POST /v1/crypto/onramp_sessions` in step 2 above\n\n`<!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=\"en\">   <head>     <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />     <title>Crypto Onramp</title>     <meta name=\"description\" content=\"A demo of hosted onramp\" />     <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" />      <script src=\"[https://js.stripe.com/v3/](https://js.stripe.com/v3/)\"></script>     <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"[https://crypto-js.stripe.com/crypto-onramp-outer.js](https://crypto-js.stripe.com/crypto-onramp-outer.js)\"></script>   </head>   <body>     <div id=\"onramp-element\" style=\"max-width: 500px\">      <script>       const stripeOnramp = StripeOnramp(`\n\n`\"pk_test_TYooMQauvdEDq54NiTphI7jx\"`\n\n`);       initialize();       // initialize onramp element with client secret       function initialize() {         const clientSecret = \"cos_1LLgeLF5fgi2FFcAWx8RlsMT_secret_WNA1VOkwZ0bHMc9MtOuyJ4vto00EMsLP7Io\";         const onrampSession = stripeOnramp.createSession({clientSecret});         onrampSession           .mount(\"#onramp-element\");       }     </script>   </body> </html>`\n\nThe above code mounts an iframe on the `#onramp-element` node, which hosts all of the onramp. You can use an event listener to enhance the user experience—for example, resuming operation in a Dapp after crypto purchases (see the [frontend events section](https://docs.stripe.com/crypto/using-the-api#frontend-events) for all events which can be subscribed to).\n\n1.  CryptoOnramp element renders and takes over\n\nAfter the above `CryptoOnramp` html element renders, the frontend client drives the interface. As the state of the session changes and we collect more details around `transaction_details`, the `CryptoOnrampSession` object updates accordingly. Webhooks and frontend events are generated for every status transition that occurs. By using frontend event listeners, you can redirect users back to your application user flow after the onramp session completes.\n\n1.  (Optional) Change the appearance of the onramp\n\nTo enable darkmode, include an appearance struct in the session creation call from above.\n\n`const onrampSession = stripeOnramp.createSession({   clientSecret: clientSecret,   appearance: {     theme: 'dark'   }, });`\n\nIf you don’t specify the appearance, the onramp defaults to a light theme. You can also change the theme after the onramp renders by calling:\n\n`onrampSession.setAppearance({   theme: newTheme });`\n\nYou can use [branding settings](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/customization#branding) to upload your logo and brand colors which automatically apply to onramp sessions created with your platform API key.\n\n## How to pre-populate transaction parameters![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nTo deliver a seamless onramp user flow, you can pre-populate some of the parameters of the onramp session. For example, a Dapp or wallet would already have a user’s `wallet_addresses`. You can achieve this during session creation as follows:\n\n`curl -X POST https://api.stripe.com/v1/crypto/onramp_sessions \\   -u` \n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`: \\   -d \"wallet_addresses[ethereum]\"=\"0xB00F0759DbeeF5E543Cc3E3B07A6442F5f3928a2\" \\   -d \"source_currency\"=\"usd\" \\   -d \"destination_currency\"=\"eth\" \\   -d \"destination_network\"=\"ethereum\" \\   -d \"destination_amount\"=\"0.1234\"`\n\nThe response:\n\n`{   \"id\": \"cos_0MYvnp589O8KAxCGwmWATYfA\",   \"object\": \"crypto.onramp_session\",   \"client_secret\": \"cos_0MYvnp589O8KAxCGwmWATYfA_secret_LhqXJi2lvbMCYhVHfrHGfUfX6009qtZPtV7\",   \"created\": 1675794121,   \"livemode\": false,   \"status\": \"initialized\",   \"transaction_details\": {     \"destination_currency\": \"eth\",     \"destination_amount\": \"0.123400000000000000\",     \"destination_network\": \"ethereum\",     \"fees\": null,     \"lock_wallet_address\": false,     \"source_currency\": \"usd\",     \"source_amount\": null,     \"destination_currencies\": [       \"btc\",       \"eth\",       \"sol\",       \"usdc\",       \"xlm\"     ],     \"destination_networks\": [       \"bitcoin\",       \"ethereum\",       \"solana\",       \"stellar\"     ],     \"transaction_id\": null,     \"wallet_address\": null,     \"wallet_addresses\": {       \"bitcoin\": null,       \"ethereum\": \"0xB00F0759DbeeF5E543Cc3E3B07A6442F5f3928a2\",       \"polygon\": null,       \"solana\": null,       \"stellar\": null,       \"destination_tags\": null     }   } }`\n\nWe allow the following parameters to be pre-populated:\n\n*   `wallet_addresses`: The suggested wallet address to deliver crypto to (the default selection on the wallet attach screen)\n*   `lock_wallet_address`: Whether or not to lock the suggested wallet address\n*   `source_currency`: The fiat currency for the transaction (`usd` and `eur` only for now)\n*   `source_amount`: The amount of fiat currency to use for the purchase of crypto (mutually exclusive with destination amount)\n*   `destination_network`: The default crypto network for this onramp (for example, `ethereum`)\n*   `destination_currency`: The default cryptocurrency for this onramp session (for example, `eth`)\n*   `destination_amount`: The amount of cryptocurrency to purchase (mutually exclusive with the source amount)\n*   `destination_currencies`: An array of cryptocurrencies you want to restrict to (for example, `[eth, usdc]`)\n*   `destination_networks`: An array of crypto networks you want to restrict to (for example, `[ethereum, polygon]`)\n\nRefer to the API reference for more details on the specific requirements and how they impact users in the onramp UI.\n\n## How to pre-populate customer information![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nTo reduce user friction during the onramp flow and increase conversion, you might want to pre-populate some of the required KYC information for the user if you’ve already collected it within your application.\n\nThroughout the flow, users will be required to provide at least:\n\n*   Email\n*   First name\n*   Last name\n*   Date of birth\n*   SSN\n*   Home address (country, address line 1, address line 2, city, state, postal code)\n\nThe onramp API provides the ability to pre-populate all of those fields except for SSN. To pre-populate this information, you can provide it using the `customer_information` parameter in the OnrampSession creation API.\n\nExample request:\n\n`curl -X POST https://api.stripe.com/v1/crypto/onramp_sessions \\   -u` \n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`: \\   -d \"customer_information[email]\"=\"john@doe.com\" \\   -d \"customer_information[first_name]\"=\"John\" \\   -d \"customer_information[last_name]\"=\"Doe\" \\   -d \"customer_information[dob][year]\"=1990 \\   -d \"customer_information[dob][month]\"=7 \\   -d \"customer_information[dob][day]\"=4 \\   -d \"customer_information[address][country]\"=\"US\" \\   -d \"customer_information[address][line1]\"=\"354 Oyster Point Blvd\" \\   -d \"customer_information[address][line2]\"=\"Apt 1A\" \\   -d \"customer_information[address][city]\"=\"South San Francisco\" \\   -d \"customer_information[address][state]\"=\"CA\" \\   -d \"customer_information[address][postal_code]\"=\"94080\"`\n\nResponse:\n\n`{   \"id\": \"cos_1MbuUeAEFtmWU4EVBFZS0gce\",   \"object\": \"crypto.onramp_session\",   \"client_secret\": \"cos_1MbuUeAEFtmWU4EVBFZS0gce_secret_zPsPPytwNU6mMKh1Bmz7ymXGi00ILwwyGeG\",   \"created\": 1676504072,   \"livemode\": false,   \"status\": \"initialized\",   \"transaction_details\": {     \"destination_currency\": null,     \"destination_amount\": null,     \"destination_network\": null,     \"fees\": null,     \"lock_wallet_address\": false,     \"source_currency\": null,     \"source_amount\": null,     \"destination_currencies\": [       \"btc\",       \"eth\",       \"sol\",       \"usdc\",       \"xlm\"     ],     \"destination_networks\": [       \"bitcoin\",       \"ethereum\",       \"solana\",       \"polygon\",       \"stellar\"     ],     \"transaction_id\": null,     \"wallet_address\": null,     \"wallet_addresses\": null   } }`\n\nWe allow the following parameters to be pre-populated:\n\n*   `customer_information.email`—Freeform string for the user’s email\n*   `customer_information.first_name`—Freeform string for the user’s first name\n*   `customer_information.last_name`—Freeform string for the user’s last name\n*   `customer_information.dob.year`—Integer for the user’s birth year\n*   `customer_information.dob.month`—Integer for the user’s birth month\n*   `customer_information.dob.day`—Integer for the user’s birth day\n*   `customer_information.address.country`—String of the two letter country code for the user’s country of residence\n*   `customer_information.address.line1`—Freeform string for the user’s address line one\n*   `customer_information.address.line2`—Freeform string for the user’s address line two\n*   `customer_information.address.city`—Freeform string for the user’s city\n*   `customer_information.address.state`—String of the two letter state code for US states (the full state name also works), for example, “CA” or “California”\n*   `customer_information.address.postal_code`—Freeform string for the user’s postal code\n\nAll of the fields are optional and you can provide any subset of them for pre-population. However, if you provide date of birth, you must also provide all of `year`, `month`, and `day` (that is, not just one or two of the birth fields).\n\n## Dealing with user supportability and fraud![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nStripe enforces limitations on the onramp product for both user supportability and in the event of fraud attacks.\n\n### Checking if a user is supportable![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nAs noted in the [Feature Set](https://docs.stripe.com/crypto/overview#feature-set) section, the onramp is only available in the United States at this time.\n\nPass `customer_ip_address` during session creation so we can preemptively check the aforementioned limitation. The endpoint returns `HTTP 400` with `code=crypto_onramp_unsupportable_customer` if the customer is in a geography we can’t support (based on `customer_ip_address`)\n\nYou might want to hide the onramp option from users in this case. Otherwise, our onramp UI renders in a `disabled` state.\n\nHere’s a sample request and response (400) illustrating this behavior:\n\n`curl -X POST https://api.stripe.com/v1/crypto/onramp_sessions \\   -u` \n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`: \\   -d \"customer_ip_address\"=\"8.8.8.8\" \\`\n\n`{   \"error\": {     \"type\": \"invalid_request_error\",     \"code\": \"crypto_onramp_unsupportable_customer\",     \"message\": \"Based on the information provided about the customer, we’re currently unable to support them.\"   } }`\n\n### Dealing with fraud attacks![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nStripe serves as the business of record and takes on the liability for disputes and fraud. Stripe has deep expertise in risk management, but we might decide to temporarily restrict creation of onramp sessions if we detect a high risk situation (for example, if we see active attacks and exploits).\n\nIf we need to shut off the API because of an unbounded fraud attack, we’ll return the following when anyone attempts to create a new session: Request:\n\n`curl -X POST https://api.stripe.com/v1/crypto/onramp_sessions \\   -u` \n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`: \\`\n\nResponse (400):\n\n`{   \"error\": {     \"type\": \"api_error\",     \"code\": \"crypto_onramp_disabled\",     \"message\": \"The v1/crypto/onramp_sessions endpoint has been disabled temporarily.

Users can still select a different wallet in the onramp UI.<br><br>For assets that use destination tags or memos, you can nest a `destination_tags` map in `wallet_addresses` that maps assets to the specified destination tag for a user. |\n| source\\_currency | String (optional) default: null | The default source fiat currency for the onramp session.<br><br>*   When left null, a default currency is selected based on user locale.<br>*   When set, it must be one of the fiat currencies supported by onramp. Users can still select a different currency in the onramp UI. |\n| source\\_amount | String (optional) default: null | The default amount of fiat (in decimal) to exchange into crypto.<br><br>*   When left null, a default value is computed if `destination_amount` is set.<br>*   When set, setting `source_amount` is mutually exclusive with setting `destination_amount` (only one or the other is supported). We don’t support fractional pennies. If fractional minor units of a currency are passed in, it generates an error. Users can update the value in the onramp UI. |\n| destination\\_networks | Array<String> (optional) default: null | The list of destination crypto networks user can choose from.<br><br>*   When left null, all supported crypto networks are shown in the onramp UI.<br>*   When set, it must be a non-empty array where values in the array are each a valid crypto network. Allowed values are `{solana, ethereum, bitcoin, polygon}`. It can be used to lock users to a specific network by passing a single value array. Users **cannot** override this parameter. |\n| destination\\_currencies | Array<String> (optional) default: null | The list of destination cryptocurrencies a user can choose from.<br><br>*   When left null, all supported cryptocurrencies are shown in the onramp UI subject to `destination_networks` if set.<br>*   When set, it must be a non-empty array where all values in the array are valid cryptocurrencies. These are `{eth, matic, sol, usdc, btc}`. You can use it to lock users to a specific cryptocurrency by passing a single value array. Users **cannot** override this parameter. |\n| destination\\_network | String (optional) default: null | The default destination crypto network.<br><br>*   When left null, the first value of `destination_networks` is selected.<br>*   When set, if `destination_networks` is also set, the value of `destination_network` must be present in that array. To lock a `destination_network`, specify that value as the single value for `destination_networks`. Supported destination networks are `{solana, bitcoin, ethereum, polygon}`. Users can select a different network in the onramp UI subject to `destination_networks` if set. |\n| destination\\_currency | String (optional) default: null | The default destination cryptocurrency.<br><br>*   When left null, the first value of `destination_currencies` is selected.<br>*   When set, if `destination_currencies` is also set, the value of `destination_currency` must be present in that array. To lock a `destination_currency`, specify that value as the single value for `destination_currencies`. Supported destination currencies are `{eth, matic, sol, usdc, btc}`. Users can select a different cryptocurrency in the onramp UI subject to `destination_currencies` if set. |\n| destination\\_amount | String (optional) default: null | The default amount of crypto to exchange into.<br><br>*   When left null, a default value is computed if `source_amount`, `destination_currency`, and `destination_network` are set.<br>*   When set, both `destination_currency` and `destination_network` must also be set. All cryptocurrencies are supported to their full precisions (for example, 18 decimal places for `eth`). We validate and generate an error if the amount exceeds the supported precision based on the exchange currency. Setting `source_amount` is mutually exclusive with setting `destination_amount` (only one or the other is supported).

We won’t send one when a new session is created. You can [configure webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks) in the Dashboard.\n\nThe resource used by the webhook will be the `CryptoOnrampSession` resource above:\n\n`{   \"id\": \"evt_123\",   \"object\": \"event\",   \"data\": {     \"object\": {       \"id\": \"cos_0MYvv9589O8KAxCGPm84FhVR\",       \"object\": \"crypto.onramp_session\",       \"client_secret\": \"cos_0MYvv9589O8KAxCGPm84FhVR_secret_IGBYKVlTlnJL8UGxji48pKxBO00deNcBuVc\",       \"created\": 1675794575,       \"livemode\": false,       \"status\": \"initialized\",       \"transaction_details\": {         \"destination_currency\": \"eth\",         \"destination_amount\": null,         \"destination_network\": \"ethereum\",         \"fees\": null,         \"lock_wallet_address\": false,         \"source_currency\": \"usd\",         \"source_amount\": null,         \"destination_currencies\": [           \"eth\"         ],         \"destination_networks\": [           \"ethereum\"         ],         \"transaction_id\": null,         \"wallet_address\": null,         \"wallet_addresses\": {           \"bitcoin\": null,           \"ethereum\": \"0xB00F0759DbeeF5E543Cc3E3B07A6442F5f3928a2\",           \"polygon\": null,           \"solana\": null,           \"stellar\": null,           \"destination_tags\": null         }       }     }   } }`\n\n### Frontend events![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nHere is the list of frontend events that you can subscribe to:\n\n`// when the onramp UI is rendered {   type: 'onramp_ui_loaded',   payload: {session: OnrampSession}, } // when the onramp session object is updated {   type: 'onramp_session_updated',   payload: {session: OnrampSession}, }  // for modal overlay render mode only {   type: 'onramp_ui_modal_opened',   payload: {session: OnrampSession}, } {   type: 'onramp_ui_modal_closed',   payload: {session: OnrampSession}, }`\n\nAs shown above, events can be subscribed to and unsubscribed to using the standard `addEventListener/removeEventListener` functions over OnrampSession. You can use `'*'` to match all events.\n\n### Session persistence![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYou can use session persistence to help you provide notifications and keep users engaged with the onramp after fulfilling their purchase.\n\n#### Advantages of session persistence![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYou might want to persist an onramp session across user visits in some instances. For example, when a user’s onramp session is disrupted or dropped, you could prompt them and provide ways to resume the onramp session later. Or if a user refreshes the page after completing the payment, you can retain the ability to notify them when a previous onramp purchase was fulfilled. For this reason, the OnrampSession object is stateful and stored as a server side resource. By initializing the onramp UI using a previously used OnrampSession client secret, users return to where they left off.\n\n#### Session persistence configuration![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nA client secret is a unique identifier for the onramp session that stores the lifecycle of a session without leaking sensitive payment information. However, it exposes private information such as wallet addresses. Don’t log it, embed it in URLs, or expose it to anyone other than the customer. Make sure that you have TLS on any page that includes the client secret. If you have a Web2-like account structure, you could link OnrampSession to your user object and fetch it upon authentication. For an account-less Web3 application, it would add user friction to require the use of message signing for authentication. Privacy-preserving local storage yields an acceptable user experience.",

  "markdown": "# Mobile integration | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Mobile integrationBeta\n\n## Learn how to integrate the onramp for mobile use.\n\nThe onramp UI supports mobile web views and mobile browsers. We don’t support mobile SDKs.\n\n### Mint a session![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nSimilar to other integrations, you need to implement a server endpoint to [create a new onramp session](https://docs.stripe.com/crypto/using-the-api) for every user visit. The endpoint returns a client\\_secret that can load the onramp UI or display an error when the onramp is unavailable.\n\n### Hosted Onramp UI![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nCreate a frontend route (for example, www.my-web3-wallet.com/onramp/<client\\_secret>) to host the onramp UI. Your /onramp/<client\\_secret> points to an onramp.html.\n\n`<!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=\"en\">   <head>     <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />     <title>Crypto Onramp</title>     <meta name=\"description\" content=\"A demo of hosted onramp\" />     <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" />     <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"[https://crypto-js.stripe.com/crypto-onramp-outer.js](https://crypto-js.stripe.com/crypto-onramp-outer.js)\"></script>     <script src=\"onramp.js\" defer></script>   </head>   <body>     <div id=\"onramp-element\" />   </body> </html>`\n\nWhere onramp.js consumes the client\\_secret from the URL and mounts the onramp UI:\n\n`const stripeOnramp = StripeOnramp(`\n\n`pk_test_TYooMQauvdEDq54NiTphI7jx`\n\n`); initialize(); // initialize onramp element with client secret function initialize() {   const url = window.location.href.replace(/\\/$/, '');   const clientSecret = url.substring(url.lastIndexOf('/') + 1);   const onrampSession = stripeOnramp.createSession({     clientSecret,     // other client side options that customize the look and feel   });   onrampSession     .addEventListener('onramp_session_updated', handleSessionUpdate)     .mount(\"#onramp-element\"); } function handleSessionUpdate(event) {   const session = event.payload.session;   if (session.status === 'fulfillment_complete' || session.status === 'rejected') {     // redirect back to mobile app via universal link     window.location.assign('/onramp_success/' + session.id);   } }`\n\nYou need to configure universal links to deep link /onramp\\_success back to your mobile app and consider providing a fallback or onramp\\_success page to ask users to manually switch back to your app.\n\n### Complete the purchase![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nSimilar to a regular integration, the frontend client drives the entirety of the onramp UI. The UI is responsive to fit the screen size—as the state of the session changes and we collect more details around transaction\\_details, the CryptoOnrampSession object updates accordingly. Webhooks and frontend events are generated for every status transition that occurs. As shown above, by using frontend event listeners, you can redirect users back to your application user flow when the OnrampSession is complete.\n\n### Redirect to the mobile app![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nUsing a deep link or manual switch, users can resume their flow in your mobile application. Your mobile application can use your backend to continue querying the state of CryptoOnrampSession. For example, if the user is topping up their user balance during initial setup, you could redirect users back to your application as soon as the session transitions into fulfillment\\_processing. You could allow users to explore the rest of your application while polling the status of the OnrampSession in the background.",

Here’s what you’ll do:\n\n1.  Add a verification button to your webpage that redirects to Stripe Identity.\n2.  Display a confirmation page on identity document submission.\n3.  Handle verification results.\n\n[](#set-up-stripe)\n\nFirst, [register](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register) for a Stripe account.\n\nThen install the libraries for access to the Stripe API from your application:\n\n`# Available as a gem sudo gem install stripe`\n\n`# If you use bundler, you can add this line to your Gemfile gem 'stripe'`\n\n[](#add-a-button)\n\nCreate a button on your website for starting the verification.\n\n### Add a button![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nStart by adding a verify button to your page:\n\n`<html>   <head>     <title>Verify your identity</title>   </head>   <body>     <button id=\"verify-button\">Verify</button>   </body> </html>`\n\n[](#redirect-to-identity)\n\nSet up the button to redirect to Stripe Identity. After clicking the button, your frontend redirects to a Stripe-hosted page where they can capture and upload a picture of their passport, driver’s license, or national ID.\n\nThe redirect to Stripe Identity cuts down on development time and maintenance and gives you added security. It also decreases the amount of private information you handle on your site, allows you to support users in a variety of platforms and languages, and allows you to customize the style to match your branding.\n\n### Create a VerificationSession![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nA [VerificationSession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_sessions) is the programmatic representation of the verification. It contains details about the type of verification, such as what [check](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verification-checks) to perform. You can [expand](https://docs.stripe.com/api/expanding_objects) the [verified outputs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_sessions/object#identity_verification_session_object-verified_outputs) field to see details of the data that was verified.\n\nAfter successfully creating a `VerificationSession`, send the [session URL](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_sessions/object#identity_verification_session_object-url) to the frontend to redirect to Stripe Identity.\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/modal_integration_diagram.4c9ef035ee7fcb8b8f58a99fcad27202.svg)\n\nYou need a server-side endpoint to [create the VerificationSession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_sessions/create). Creating the `VerificationSession` server-side prevents malicious users from overriding verification options and incurring processing charges on your account. Add authentication to this endpoint by including a user reference in the session metadata or storing the session ID in your database.\n\n`// Set your secret key. Remember to switch to your live secret key in production. // See your keys here: [https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys) const stripe = require('stripe')(`\n\n`'sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc'`\n\n`);  // In the route handler for /create-verification-session: // Authenticate your user.  // Create the session. const verificationSession = await stripe.identity.verificationSessions.create({   type: 'document',   metadata: {     user_id: '{{USER_ID}}',   }, });  // Return only the session URL to the frontend. const url = verificationSession.url;`\n\n#### Caution\n\nThe session URL is single-use and expires after 48 hours. Don’t store it, log it, embed it in a URL, or expose it to anyone other than the user. Send only the session URL to your frontend to avoid exposing verification configuration or results.\n\nTest your endpoint by starting your web server (for example, `localhost:4242`) and sending a POST request with curl to create a VerificationSession:\n\n`curl -X POST -is \"http://localhost:4242/create-verification-session\" -d \"\"`\n\nThe response in your terminal looks like this:\n\n### Add an event handler to the verify button![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nNow that you have a button and an endpoint to create a VerificationSession, modify the button to redirect to the session URL when clicked:\n\n`<html>   <head>     <title>Verify your identity</title>     <script src=\"[https://js.stripe.com/v3/](https://js.stripe.com/v3/)\"></script>   </head>   <body>     <button id=\"verify-button\">Verify</button>      <script type=\"text/javascript\">       var verifyButton = document.getElementById('verify-button');        verifyButton.addEventListener('click', function() {         // Get the VerificationSession client secret using the server-side         // endpoint you created in step 3.         fetch('/create-verification-session', {           method: 'POST',         })         .then(function(response) {           return response.json();         })         .then(function(session) {           // When the user clicks on the button, redirect to the session URL.           window.location.href = session.url;         })         .catch(function(error) {           console.error('Error:', error);         });       });     </script>   </body> </html>`\n\n### Test the redirect![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nTest that the verify button redirects to Stripe Identity:\n\n*   Click the verify button.\n*   Ensure your browser redirects to Stripe Identity.\n\nIf your integration isn’t working:\n\n1.  Open the Network tab in your browser’s developer tools.\n2.  Click the verify button to see if it makes an XHR request to your server-side endpoint (`POST /create-verification-session`).\n3.  Verify that the request returns a 200 status.\n4.  Use `console.log(session)` inside your button click listener to confirm that it returns the correct data.\n\n[\n\n## Handle verification events![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n\n\n](#handle-verification-events)\n\n[Document checks](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verification-checks#document-availability) are typically completed as soon as the user redirects back to your site and you can retrieve the result from the API immediately. In some rare cases, the document verification isn’t ready yet and must continue asynchronously. In these cases, you’re notified through webhooks when the verification result is ready. After the processing completes, the VerificationSession [status changes](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/how-sessions-work) from `processing` to `verified`.\n\nStripe sends the following events when the session status changes:\n\nUse a [webhook handler](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/handle-verification-outcomes) to receive these events and automate actions like sending a confirmation email, updating the verification results in your database, or completing an onboarding step.

[Learn more](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verification-sessions#cancel).\n\n### Parameters\n\nNo parameters.\n\n### Returns\n\nReturns the canceled VerificationSession object\n\nPOST /v1/identity/verification\\_sessions/:id/cancel\n\n```\ncurl -X POST https://api.stripe.com/v1/identity/verification_sessions/vs_1NuN3kLkdIwHu7ixk5OvTq3b/cancel \\  -u \"sk_test_4eC39Hq...arjtT1zdp7dcsk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc:\"\n```\n\n```\n{  \"id\": \"vs_1NuN3kLkdIwHu7ixk5OvTq3b\",  \"object\": \"identity.verification_session\",  \"client_secret\": null,  \"created\": 1695680120,  \"last_error\": null,  \"last_verification_report\": null,  \"livemode\": false,  \"metadata\": {},  \"options\": {    \"document\": {      \"require_matching_selfie\": true    }  },  \"redaction\": null,  \"status\": \"canceled\",  \"type\": \"document\",  \"url\": null}\n```\n\n## [Redact a VerificationSession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_sessions/redact)\n\nRedact a VerificationSession to remove all collected information from Stripe. This will redact the VerificationSession and all objects related to it, including VerificationReports, Events, request logs, etc.\n\nA VerificationSession object can be redacted when it is in `requires_input` or `verified` [status](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/how-sessions-work). Redacting a VerificationSession in `requires_action` state will automatically cancel it.\n\nThe redaction process may take up to four days. When the redaction process is in progress, the VerificationSession’s `redaction.status` field will be set to `processing`; when the process is finished, it will change to `redacted` and an `identity.verification_session.redacted` event will be emitted.\n\nRedaction is irreversible. Redacted objects are still accessible in the Stripe API, but all the fields that contain personal data will be replaced by the string `[redacted]` or a similar placeholder. The `metadata` field will also be erased. Redacted objects cannot be updated or used for any purpose.\n\n[Learn more](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verification-sessions#redact).\n\n### Parameters\n\nNo parameters.\n\n### Returns\n\nReturns the redacted VerificationSession object\n\nPOST /v1/identity/verification\\_sessions/:id/redact\n\n```\ncurl -X POST https://api.stripe.com/v1/identity/verification_sessions/vs_1NuN3kLkdIwHu7ixk5OvTq3b/redact \\  -u \"sk_test_4eC39Hq...arjtT1zdp7dcsk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc:\"\n```\n\n```\n{  \"id\": \"vs_1NuN3kLkdIwHu7ixk5OvTq3b\",  \"object\": \"identity.verification_session\",  \"client_secret\": null,  \"created\": 1695680120,  \"last_error\": null,  \"last_verification_report\": null,  \"livemode\": false,  \"metadata\": {},  \"options\": {    \"document\": {      \"require_matching_selfie\": true    }  },  \"redaction\": {    \"status\": \"processing\"  },  \"status\": \"canceled\",  \"type\": \"document\",  \"url\": null}\n```\n\n## [Verification Report](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_reports)\n\nA VerificationReport is the result of an attempt to collect and verify data from a user. The collection of verification checks performed is determined from the `type` and `options` parameters used. You can find the result of each verification check performed in the appropriate sub-resource: `document`, `id_number`, `selfie`.\n\nEach VerificationReport contains a copy of any data collected by the user as well as reference IDs which can be used to access collected images through the [FileUpload](https://docs.stripe.com/api/files) API. To configure and create VerificationReports, use the [VerificationSession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_sessions) API.\n\nRelated guide: [Accessing verification results](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verification-sessions#results).\n\n## [Crypto Onramp Quotes](https://docs.stripe.com/api/crypto/onramp_quotes)\n\nCrypto Onramp Quotes are estimated quotes for onramp conversions into all the different cryptocurrencies on different networks. The Quotes API allows you to display quotes in your product UI before directing the user to the onramp widget.\n\nRelated guide: [Quotes API](https://docs.stripe.com/crypto/quotes-api)\n\n## [Climate Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/climate/product)\n\nA Climate product represents a type of carbon removal unit available for reservation. You can retrieve it to see the current price and availability.\n\n## [Forwarding Request](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/request)\n\nInstructs Stripe to make a request on your behalf using the destination URL. The destination URL is activated by Stripe at the time of onboarding. Stripe verifies requests with your credentials provided during onboarding, and injects card details from the payment\\_method into the request.\n\nStripe redacts all sensitive fields and headers, including authentication credentials and card numbers, before storing the request and response data in the forwarding Request object, which are subject to a 30-day retention period.\n\nYou can provide a Stripe idempotency key to make sure that requests with the same key result in only one outbound request. The Stripe idempotency key provided should be unique and different from any idempotency keys provided on the underlying third-party request.\n\nForwarding Requests are synchronous requests that return a response or time out according to Stripe’s limits.\n\nRelated guide: [Forward card details to third-party API endpoints](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/forwarding).\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/create)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/retrieve)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/list)",

The destination URL is activated by Stripe at the time of onboarding. Stripe verifies requests with your credentials provided during onboarding, and injects card details from the payment\\_method into the request.\n\nStripe redacts all sensitive fields and headers, including authentication credentials and card numbers, before storing the request and response data in the forwarding Request object, which are subject to a 30-day retention period.\n\nYou can provide a Stripe idempotency key to make sure that requests with the same key result in only one outbound request. The Stripe idempotency key provided should be unique and different from any idempotency keys provided on the underlying third-party request.\n\nForwarding Requests are synchronous requests that return a response or time out according to Stripe’s limits.\n\nRelated guide: [Forward card details to third-party API endpoints](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/forwarding).\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/create)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/retrieve)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/list)",

  "markdown": "# OAuth changes for platform-controlled Standard accounts\n\n## Learn about the changes Stripe has made to OAuth for Connect.\n\nWe’ve updated OAuth to isolate platforms’ processing activity on platform-controlled Standard accounts. Platforms using OAuth with `read_write` scope can’t connect to Standard accounts that are controlled by another platform. Prior to June 2021, multiple platforms could connect to the same Standard account.\n\nThis change ensures that in the rare case that a [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect \"Connect\") user with access to the Stripe Dashboard interacts with two platforms, each platform’s activity is kept distinct in separate Standard accounts.\n\nWhen a user of a Standard account controlled by another platform connects to your platform, the Connect onboarding flow directs them to create a separate Standard account to use with your platform. The new account automatically connects to your platform.\n\nIf you registered your Connect application as an [Extension integration](https://docs.stripe.com/building-extensions), it can still connect to accounts that are connected to another platform. Extensions need to connect to existing Standard accounts that might also be connected to another Platform or Extension. Only Extensions can use `read_only`, which ensures that platforms can’t read other applications’ data.\n\nHowever, if you had previously selected ‘Platform’ for your Connect application, and find that you need Extension functionality, then you will need to [contact us](https://support.stripe.com/contact/email?topic=connect) to modify your integration selection. Your selection can be found at the [Connect Settings page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect) in the ‘Availability’ section.",

  "markdown": "# Collect card payments | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\nCollecting payments with Stripe Terminal requires writing a payment flow in your application. Use the Stripe Terminal SDK to create and update a [PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api#payment_intents), an object representing a single payment session.\n\nDesigned to be robust to failures, the Terminal integration splits the payment process into several steps, each of which can be retried safely:\n\n1.  [Create a PaymentIntent](#create-payment)\n2.  [Collect a payment method](#collect-payment) you can define whether to [automatically](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-capture_method) or [manually](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/place-a-hold-on-a-payment-method) capture your payments\n3.  [Confirm the payment](#confirm-payment) Authorization on the customer’s card takes place when the SDK confirms the payment.\n4.  (Optional) [Capture the payment](#capture-payment)\n\n[](#create-payment)\n\nThe first step when collecting payments is to start the payment flow. When a customer begins checking out, your application must create a `PaymentIntent` object. This represents a new payment session on Stripe.\n\nYou can create a PaymentIntent on the client or server.\n\nUse [test amounts](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/references/testing#physical-test-cards) to try producing different results. An amount ending in `00` results in an approved payment.\n\n### Client-side ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nCreate a PaymentIntent from your client:\n\n#### Warning\n\nIf your app is connected to the Verifone P400, you can’t create a PaymentIntent from the iOS SDK. Instead, you must [create the PaymentIntent server-side](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/collect-card-payment#create-server-side), and retrieve the PaymentIntent in your app using the `Terminal.retrievePaymentIntent` method in the SDK.\n\nPaymentViewController.swift\n\n`import UIKit import StripeTerminal  class PaymentViewController: UIViewController {      // ...      // Action for a \"Checkout\" button     func checkoutAction() throws {         let params = try PaymentIntentParametersBuilder(amount: 1000, currency: \"usd\").build()         Terminal.shared.createPaymentIntent(params) { createResult, createError in             if let error = createError {                 print(\"createPaymentIntent failed: \\(error)\")             } else if let paymentIntent = createResult {                 print(\"createPaymentIntent succeeded\")                 // ...             }          }     }      // ... }`\n\n### Server-side ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nYou can create the `PaymentIntent` on your server if the information required to start a payment isn’t readily available in your app.\n\nThe following example shows how to create a `PaymentIntent` on your server:\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/payment_intents \\   -u` \n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`: \\   -d \"amount\"=1000 \\   -d \"currency\"=\"usd\" \\   -d \"payment_method_types[]\"=\"card_present\" \\   -d \"capture_method\"=\"manual\"`\n\nFor Terminal payments, the `payment_method_types` parameter must include `card_present`.\n\nYou can control the payment flow as follows:\n\n*   To fully control the payment flow for `card_present` payments, set the `capture_method` to `manual`. This allows you to add a reconciliation step before finalizing the payment.\n*   To authorize and capture payments in one step, set the `capture_method` to `automatic`.\n\nTo accept payments in Australia, you need to set `capture_method` to `automatic` or `manual_preferred`. For more details, visit our [Australia documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/regional?integration-country=AU). To accept Interac payments in Canada, you must also include `interac_present` in `payment_method_types`. For more details, visit our [Canada documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/regional?integration-country=CA).\n\nThe PaymentIntent contains a [client secret](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-client_secret), a key that is unique to the individual PaymentIntent. To use the client secret, you must obtain it from the PaymentIntent on your server and [pass it to the client side](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents#passing-to-client).\n\n`post '/create_payment_intent' do   intent = # ... Create or retrieve the PaymentIntent   {client_secret: intent.client_secret}.to_json end`\n\nFirst use the client secret to call `retrievePaymentIntent`, and then use the retrieved PaymentIntent to call `collectPaymentMethod`.\n\nPaymentViewController.swift\n\n`func checkoutButtonAction() {     // ... Fetch the client secret from your backend     Terminal.shared.retrievePaymentIntent(clientSecret: clientSecret) { retrieveResult, retrieveError in         if let error = retrieveError {             print(\"retrievePaymentIntent failed: \\(error)\")         }         else if let paymentIntent = retrieveResult {             print(\"retrievePaymentIntent succeeded: \\(paymentIntent)\")             // ...         }     } }`\n\n[](#collect-payment)\n\nAfter you’ve created a PaymentIntent, the next step is to collect a payment method with the SDK.\n\nIn order to collect a payment method, your app needs to be connected to a reader. The connected reader waits for a card to be presented after your app calls `collectPaymentMethod`.\n\nPaymentViewController.swift\n\n`import UIKit import StripeTerminal  class PaymentViewController: UIViewController, ReaderDisplayDelegate {      // Label for displaying messages from the card reader     let readerMessageLabel = UILabel(frame: .zero)     var collectCancelable: Cancelable? = nil      // ...      // Action for a \"Checkout\" button     func checkoutAction() throws {         let params = try PaymentIntentParametersBuilder(amount: 1000, currency: \"usd\").build()         Terminal.shared.createPaymentIntent(params) { createResult, createError in             if let error = createError {                 print(\"createPaymentIntent failed: \\(error)\")             }             else if let paymentIntent = createResult {                 print(\"createPaymentIntent succeeded\")                 self.collectCancelable = Terminal.shared.collectPaymentMethod(paymentIntent) { collectResult, collectError in                     if let error = collectError {                         print(\"collectPaymentMethod failed: \\(error)\")                     }                     else if let paymentIntent = collectResult {                         print(\"collectPaymentMethod succeeded\")                         // ... Confirm the payment                     }                 }             }          }     }  }   // MARK: BluetoothReaderDelegate - only needed for Bluetooth readers, this is the delegate set during connectBluetoothReader   func reader(_ reader: Reader, didRequestReaderInput inputOptions: ReaderInputOptions = []) {      readerMessageLabel.text = Terminal.stringFromReaderInputOptions(inputOptions)  }   func reader(_ reader: Reader, didRequestReaderDisplayMessage displayMessage: ReaderDisplayMessage) {      readerMessageLabel.text = Terminal.stringFromReaderDisplayMessage(displayMessage)  }  // MARK: ReaderDisplayDelegate   func terminal(_ terminal: Terminal, didRequestReaderInput inputOptions: ReaderInputOptions = []) {      readerMessageLabel.text = Terminal.stringFromReaderInputOptions(inputOptions)  }   func terminal(_ terminal: Terminal, didRequestReaderDisplayMessage displayMessage: ReaderDisplayMessage) {      readerMessageLabel.text = Terminal.stringFromReaderDisplayMessage(displayMessage)  }`\n\nThis method collects encrypted payment method data using the connected card reader, and associates the encrypted data with the local PaymentIntent.\n\n#### Caution\n\nCollecting a payment method happens locally and requires no authorization or updates to the Payment Intents API object until the next step, [confirm the payment](#confirm-payment).\n\n### Optionally inspect payment method details Beta![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nFor advanced use cases, you can examine the payment method details of the presented card and perform your own business logic prior to authorization.\n\nUse the `initWithUpdatePaymentIntent` parameter in `CollectConfiguration` to attach a PaymentMethod to the server-side PaymentIntent. This data is returned in the `collectPaymentMethod` response.\n\nPaymentViewController.swift\n\n`class PaymentViewController: UIViewController, ReaderDisplayDelegate {     // ...      // Action for a \"Checkout\" button     func checkoutAction() throws {         let params = try PaymentIntentParametersBuilder(amount: 1000, currency: \"usd\").build()         Terminal.shared.createPaymentIntent(params) { createResult, createError in             if let error = createError {                 print(\"createPaymentIntent failed: \\(error)\")             }             else if let paymentIntent = createResult {                 print(\"createPaymentIntent succeeded\")                 let collectConfig = try CollectConfigurationBuilder().setUpdatePaymentIntent(true).build()                 self.collectCancelable = Terminal.shared.collectPaymentMethod(paymentIntent: paymentIntent, collectConfig: collectConfig) {                   collectResult, collectError in                     if let error = collectError {                         print(\"collectPaymentMethod failed: \\(error)\")                     }                     else if let paymentIntent = collectResult {                         print(\"collectPaymentMethod succeeded\")                         if let paymentMethod = paymentIntent.paymentMethod,                             let card = paymentMethod.cardPresent ?? paymentMethod.interacPresent {                              // ... Perform business logic on card                         }                          // ... Confirm the payment                     }                 }             }          }     }  }`\n\n#### Note\n\nThis method attaches the collected encrypted payment method data with an update to the PaymentIntent object. It requires no authorization until the next step, [confirm the payment](#confirm-payment).\n\nThis advanced use case isn’t supported on the Verifone P400 or with simulated Terminal readers.\n\nYou can access attributes like card brand, funding, and other useful data at this point.\n\n#### Note\n\nStripe attempts to detect whether a mobile wallet is used in a transaction as shown in the `wallet.type` attribute. However, the attribute isn’t populated if the card’s issuing bank doesn’t support reader-driven identification of a mobile wallet, so accurate detection isn’t guaranteed. After authorization in the [confirmation](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/collect-card-payment#confirm-payment) step, Stripe receives up-to-date information from the networks and updates `wallet.type` reliably\n\n### Cancel collection ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\n#### Programmatic cancellation![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYou can cancel collecting a payment method using the `Cancelable` object returned by the iOS SDK.\n\n#### Customer-initiated cancellation![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nWhen you set `setEnableCustomerCancellation` to true for a transaction, smart reader users see a cancel button. Tapping the cancel button cancels the active transaction.\n\nPaymentViewController.swift\n\n`let collectConfig = try CollectConfigurationBuilder()     .setEnableCustomerCancellation(true)     .build() Terminal.shared.collectPaymentMethod(paymentIntent: paymentIntent, collectConfig: collectConfig) {     intentWithPaymentMethod, attachError in }`\n\n### Handle events ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nWhen collecting a payment method using a reader like the [BBPOS Chipper 2X BT](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/readers/bbpos-chipper2xbt), without a built-in display, your app must be able to display events from the payment method collection process to users. These events help users successfully collect payments (for example, retrying a card, trying a different card, or using a different read method).\n\nWhen a transaction begins, the SDK passes a `ReaderInputOptions` value to your app’s reader display handler, denoting the acceptable types of input (for example, Swipe, Insert, Tap). In your app’s checkout UI, prompt the user to present a card using one of these options.\n\nDuring the transaction, the SDK might request your app to display additional prompts (for example, Retry Card) to your user by passing a `ReaderDisplayMessage` value to your app’s reader display handler. Make sure your checkout UI displays these messages to the user.\n\n#### Note\n\nYour application doesn’t need to display events from the payment method collection process to users because the reader displays them. To clear the payment method on a transaction, you can [cancel the request](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/collect-card-payment?terminal-sdk-platform=server-driven#payment-cancellation).\n\nPaymentViewController.swift\n\n`// MARK: BluetoothReaderDelegate - only needed for Bluetooth readers, this is the delegate set during connectBluetoothReader   func reader(_ reader: Reader, didRequestReaderInput inputOptions: ReaderInputOptions = []) {      readerMessageLabel.text = Terminal.stringFromReaderInputOptions(inputOptions)  }   func reader(_ reader: Reader, didRequestReaderDisplayMessage displayMessage: ReaderDisplayMessage) {      readerMessageLabel.text = Terminal.stringFromReaderDisplayMessage(displayMessage)  }`\n\n### Collect payments with Tap to Pay on iPhone ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nWhen your application is ready to collect a payment, the Stripe iOS SDK takes over the display to handle the collection process. After calling the [collect payment method](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/collect-card-payment#collect-payment), your application remains running, but the iPhone displays a full-screen prompt to the cardholder, instructing them to present their card or NFC-based mobile wallet. If there’s an error reading the card, a prompt for retry displays. A successful presentation returns a success indication, and then control returns to your application to [confirm the payment](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/collect-card-payment#confirm-payment).\n\n![Tap to pay on iPhone](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/tap-on-mobile-ios-payment-collection.544683eeac33062a8cc3e6b4959fe895.jpeg)\n\nPayment collection\n\n[](#confirm-payment)\n\nAfter successfully collecting a payment method from the customer, the next step is to confirm the payment with the SDK. When you’re ready to proceed with the payment, call `confirmPaymentIntent` with the updated `PaymentIntent` from [Step 2](#collect_payment).\n\n*   For manual capture of payments, a successful `confirmPaymentIntent` call results in a `PaymentIntent` with a status of `requires_capture`.\n*   For automatic capture of payments, the `PaymentIntent` transitions to a `succeeded` state.\n\nPaymentViewController.swift\n\n`// Action for a \"Checkout\" button func checkoutAction() throws {   let params = try PaymentIntentParametersBuilder(amount: 1000, currency: \"usd\").build()   Terminal.shared.createPaymentIntent(params) { createResult, createError in       if let error = createError {           print(\"createPaymentIntent failed: \\(error)\")       } else if let paymentIntent = createResult {           print(\"createPaymentIntent succeeded\")           self.collectCancelable = Terminal.shared.collectPaymentMethod(paymentIntent) { collectResult, collectError in               if let error = collectError {                   print(\"collectPaymentMethod failed: \\(error)\")               } else if let collectPaymentMethodPaymentIntent = collectResult {                   print(\"collectPaymentMethod succeeded\")                   // ...

Your application needs to inspect the `PaymentIntent` to decide how to deal with the error.\n\n| PaymentIntent Status | Meaning | Resolution |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `requires_payment_method` | Payment method declined | Try collecting a different payment method by calling `collectPaymentMethod` again with the same PaymentIntent. |\n| `requires_confirmation` | Temporary connectivity problem | Call `confirmPaymentIntent` again with the same PaymentIntent to retry the request. |\n| PaymentIntent is `nil` | Request to Stripe timed out, unknown PaymentIntent status | Retry confirming the original PaymentIntent. Don’t create a new one, as that could result in multiple authorizations for the cardholder. |\n\nIf you encounter multiple, consecutive timeouts, there might be a problem with your connectivity. Make sure that your app can communicate with the internet.\n\n### Avoiding double charges ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nThe PaymentIntent object enables money movement at Stripe—use a single PaymentIntent to represent a transaction.\n\nRe-use the same PaymentIntent after a card is declined (for example, if it has insufficient funds), so your customer can try again with a different card.\n\nIf you edit the PaymentIntent, you must call `collectPaymentMethod` to update the payment information on the reader.\n\nA PaymentIntent must be in the `requires_payment_method` state before Stripe can confirm it. An authorized, captured, or canceled PaymentIntent can’t be confirmed by a reader.\n\n[](#capture-payment)\n\nIf you defined `capture_method` as `manual` during `PaymentIntent` creation in [Step 1](#create-payment), the SDK returns an authorized but not captured `PaymentIntent` to your application. Learn more about the difference between [authorization and capture](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/place-a-hold-on-a-payment-method).\n\nWhen your app receives a confirmed `PaymentIntent` from the SDK, make sure it notifies your backend to capture the payment. Create an endpoint on your backend that accepts a `PaymentIntent` ID and sends a request to the Stripe API to capture it:\n\n`curl -X POST https://api.stripe.com/v1/payment_intents/{{PAYMENT_INTENT_ID}}/capture \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\"`\n\nA successful `capture` call results in a `PaymentIntent` with a status of `succeeded`.\n\n#### Note\n\nTo ensure the application fee captured is correct for connected accounts, inspect each `PaymentIntent` and modify the application fee, if needed, prior to manually capturing the payment.\n\n### Reconcile payments ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nTo monitor the payments activity of your business, you may want to reconcile PaymentIntents with your internal orders system on your server at the end of a day’s activity.\n\nA PaymentIntent that retains a `requires_capture` status may represent two things:\n\n**Unnecessary authorization on your customer’s card statement**\n\n*   Cause: User abandons your app’s checkout flow in the middle of a transaction\n*   Solution: If the uncaptured PaymentIntent isn’t associated with a completed order on your server, you can [cancel](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/cancel) it. A canceled PaymentIntent can no longer be used to perform charges.\n\n**Incomplete collection of funds from a customer**\n\n*   Cause: Failure of the request from your app notifying your backend to capture the payment\n*   Solution: If the uncaptured PaymentIntent is associated with a completed order on your server, and no other payment has been taken for the order (for example, a cash payment), you can [capture](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/capture) it.\n\n### Collect tips US only![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nIn the US, eligible users can [collect tips when capturing payments](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/features/collecting-tips/on-receipt).",

  "markdown": "# TLS Certificates | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Learn how to make sure your integration securely communicates with Stripe.\n\nYour integration connects to Stripe’s API securely over [HTTPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS)–the HTTP protocol encrypted over a [Transport Security Layer (TLS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) connection. Whether you use Stripe managed SDKs, curl, or other HTTP clients to connect to Stripe APIs, TLS ensures that you’re connecting to Stripe servers and that third parties can’t read or modify API requests or responses.\n\n## TLS certificates![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n[TLS certificates](https://www.digicert.com/tls-ssl/tls-ssl-certificates) are how your integration verifies it’s connecting to a Stripe-owned server. A digital certificate includes (but isn’t limited to) the host name of the server, information about the owner of the server/domain, duration of validity, and the identity of a trusted [certificate authority (CA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority) that issued or signed this certificate. A client connecting to the server performs [path validation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certification_path_validation_algorithm) on the certificate where it verifies that the subject field of the certificate matches the domain name of the server that it’s trying to connect to, the certificate isn’t expired, and that a trusted CA issued the certificate. For more details, you can [read about certificates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_certificate).\n\n## Certificate pinning![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nWhen you connect to Stripe API endpoints, certificates load from a CA certificates bundle that your operating system provides, or from browser or Stripe Bindings (depending on the HTTP client used for this connection). These certificates are treated as valid trusted certificates during certificate path validation. Certificate pinning is the process of restricting which certificates are considered valid for a particular HTTPS website or endpoint. Stripe recommends against certificate pinning to avoid complications with your integration when we roll out new certificates for our systems. DigiCert, one of the major CAs, also recommends against [certificate pinning](https://www.digicert.com/blog/certificate-pinning-what-is-certificate-pinning).\n\n### What to do if you need to use certificate pinning![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nAs a Stripe user, if you must use certificate pinning for some reason, make sure you pin _only_ (and **all** of) the **root** certificates listed [below](#root-certificates-for-stripe-domains). Do **NOT** pin the entire certificate chain, the intermediate certificate, or the end-entity (leaf) certificate. If you do, you run a high risk of breaking your integration as Stripe updates certificates for our systems every few months, including the intermediate CA certificates.\n\nOur root certificates listed below might also change in the future, both routinely and on an emergency basis. For routine changes to the list of root certificates, Stripe will give seven days notice through the [API announce mailing list](https://groups.google.com/a/lists.stripe.com/g/api-announce) before we roll out the change. You **must** make sure that all your clients that connect to Stripe APIs, including mobile applications, can handle this certificate list changing with seven days notice. Emergency rotations might have a shorter interval between notification and change.\n\n#### Root certificates for Stripe domains![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n*   **DigiCert Global Root CA**\n    \n    *   Serial #: `08:3b:e0:56:90:42:46:b1:a1:75:6a:c9:59:91:c7:4a`\n    *   SHA1 Fingerprint: `a8:98:5d:3a:65:e5:e5:c4:b2:d7:d6:6d:40:c6:dd:2f:b1:9c:54:36`\n*   **DigiCert Global Root G2**\n    \n    *   Serial #: `03:3a:f1:e6:a7:11:a9:a0:bb:28:64:b1:1d:09:fa:e5`\n    *   SHA1 Fingerprint: `df:3c:24:f9:bf:d6:66:76:1b:26:80:73:fe:06:d1:cc:8d:4f:82:a4`\n*   **DigiCert Global Root G3**\n    \n    *   Serial #: `05:55:56:bc:f2:5e:a4:35:35:c3:a4:0f:d5:ab:45:72`\n    *   SHA1 Fingerprint: `7e:04:de:89:6a:3e:66:6d:00:e6:87:d3:3f:fa:d9:3b:e8:3d:34:9e`\n*   **DigiCert High Assurance EV Root CA**\n    \n    *   Serial #: `02:ac:5c:26:6a:0b:40:9b:8f:0b:79:f2:ae:46:25:77`\n    *   SHA1 Fingerprint: `5f:b7:ee:06:33:e2:59:db:ad:0c:4c:9a:e6:d3:8f:1a:61:c7:dc:25`\n*   **GlobalSign Root R3**\n    \n    *   Serial #: `04:00:00:00:00:01:21:58:53:08:a2`\n    *   SHA1 Fingerprint: `d6:9b:56:11:48:f0:1c:77:c5:45:78:c1:09:26:df:5b:85:69:76:ad`\n*   **GlobalSign Root R6**\n    \n    *   Serial #: `45:e6:bb:03:83:33:c3:85:65:48:e6:ff:45:51`\n    *   SHA1 Fingerprint: `80:94:64:0e:b5:a7:a1:ca:11:9c:1f:dd:d5:9f:81:02:63:a7:fb:d1`\n*   **GlobalSign ECC Root R5**\n    \n    *   Serial #: `60:59:49:e0:26:2e:bb:55:f9:0a:77:8a:71:f9:4a:d8:6c`\n    *   SHA1 Fingerprint: `1f:24:c6:30:cd:a4:18:ef:20:69:ff:ad:4f:dd:5f:46:3a:1b:69:aa`\n\nYou can verify and download the above root CA certificates from [DigiCert](https://www.digicert.com/kb/digicert-root-certificates.htm) and [GlobalSign](https://support.globalsign.com/ca-certificates/root-certificates/globalsign-root-certificates).",

In your app, build a flow to [register](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/create) a reader with the Stripe API.\n\n1.  If you have a Verifone P400, enter the key sequence `0-7-1-3-9` to display a unique registration code.

The user enters the code in your application.\n3.  Your application sends the code to Stripe:\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/terminal/readers \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d registration_code={{READER_REGISTRATION_CODE}} \\   --data-urlencode label=\"Alice's reader\" \\  -d location=  {{LOCATION_ID}}    `\n\nTo confirm that you’ve registered a reader correctly, list all the readers you’ve registered at that location:\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/terminal/readers \\   -u` \n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:`\n\n[](#discover-readers)\n\nAfter registering the reader to your account, search for previously registered readers to connect to your point of sale application using the `discoverReaders` method. You can scope your discovery using the `location` you registered the reader to in the previous step.\n\n[](#connect-reader)\n\nTo connect your point of sale application to a reader, call [connectReader](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/references/api/js-sdk#connect-reader) with the selected reader.\n\n`async function connectReader(discoverResult) {   // Just select the first reader here.   const selectedReader = discoverResult.discoveredReaders[0];    const connectResult = await terminal.connectReader(selectedReader);   if (connectResult.error) {     console.log('Failed to connect:', connectResult.error);   } else {     console.log('Connected to reader:', connectResult.reader.label);   } }`\n\n### Multiple connections![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n`const connectResult = await terminal.connectReader(reader, {fail_if_in_use: true});`\n\n|     | fail\\_if\\_in\\_use is false (default) | fail\\_if\\_in\\_use is true |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `connectReader` called from a new SDK when the reader is idle | The existing SDK-to-reader connection breaks, and the new SDK connects to the reader.

The existing SDK-to-reader connection does not break and the command in progress continues. |\n\nFor the least-disruptive connection experience in multi-reader environments, we recommend setting `fail_if_in_use` to `true` on your application’s initial connection attempt. Then, allow your users to retry the connection with `fail_if_in_use` set to `false` if the connection fails the first time. With this setup, one of your users can’t accidentally interrupt a transaction by inadvertently connecting to an in-use reader, but can still connect if needed.\n\n### Handle disconnects ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nYour app must implement the `UnexpectedReaderDisconnect` callback to handle when a reader is disconnected.\n\nWhen you implement this callback, display a UI that notifies your user of the disconnected reader. You can call `discoverReaders` to scan for readers and initiate reconnection. Your app can attempt to automatically reconnect to the disconnected reader or display a UI that prompts your user to reconnect to a different reader.\n\nThe reader can disconnect from your app if it loses connection to the network. To simulate an unexpected disconnect, power off the reader.\n\n`const terminal = StripeTerminal.create({   onFetchConnectionToken: fetchConnectionToken,   onUnexpectedReaderDisconnect: unexpectedDisconnect, });  function unexpectedDisconnect() {   // Consider displaying a UI to notify the user and start rediscovering readers }`\n\n### Automatic reconnection![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nStripe Terminal doesn’t automatically reconnect to a reader when your application starts. Instead, you can build a reconnection flow by storing reader IDs and attempting to connect to a known reader on startup.\n\n1.  When you successfully connect to a reader, save its serial number in a persistent data storage location, such as the [localStorage API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage).\n2.  When your app launches, check that persistent store for a saved serial number. If one is found, call the `discoverReaders` method so your application can try to find that reader again.\n3.  If the saved serial number matches any of the discovered readers, try connecting to that reader with the matching reader object returned from the call to `discoverReaders`. If the previously connected reader isn’t found, stop the discovery process.\n\nDisplay some UI during the discovery and connection process to indicate that an automatic reconnection is taking place.\n\nThe BBPOS and Chipper™ name and logo are trademarks or registered trademarks of BBPOS Limited in the United States and/or other countries.

Then, from your app, search for nearby Bluetooth-connected readers using the [discoverReaders](https://stripe.dev/stripe-terminal-android/core/com.stripe.stripeterminal/-terminal/discover-readers.html) method.\n\nReaderDiscoveryActivity.kt\n\n``class ReaderDiscoveryActivity : AppCompatActivity(), DiscoveryListener {    var discoverCancelable: Cancelable? = null    // ...    // Action for a \"Discover Readers\" button    fun discoverReadersAction() {     val config = DiscoveryConfiguration.BluetoothDiscoveryConfiguration()      Terminal.getInstance().discoverReaders(config, this, object : Callback {       override fun onSuccess() {         println(\"discoverReaders succeeded\")       }        override fun onFailure(e: TerminalException) {         e.printStackTrace()       }     })    }    // DiscoveryListener   override fun onUpdateDiscoveredReaders(readers: List<Reader>) {     // In your app, display the discovered reader(s) to the user.     // Call `connectBluetoothReader` after the user selects a reader to connect to.    }  }``\n\n#### Bluetooth scan ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nBluetooth scan searches for all nearby readers and returns a list of discovered readers to your app. As the discovery process continues, the SDK continues to invoke the `DiscoveryDelegate.didUpdateDiscoveredReaders` method with the latest list of nearby readers.\n\nWith the Bluetooth scan discovery method, you can set a timeout to scan for a set period of time, which you can use for managing battery life or triggering an error message if no devices are found.\n\nIn your mobile application, we recommend displaying an auto-updating list of discovered readers, with serial numbers or labels to help users identify their reader.\n\n[](#connect-reader)\n\nTo connect to a discovered reader, call the `connectBluetoothReader` method from your app. As soon as the SDK connects to the reader, the reader’s status light shines solid blue.\n\nYou must [register your reader](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/fleet/locations-and-zones) to a [location](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/locations) upon connection. To do so, create and use a `BluetoothConnectionConfiguration` with the `locationId` set to the relevant location ID when connecting.\n\nReaderDiscoveryActivity.kt\n\n``// Call `connectBluetoothReader` with the selected reader and a connection config // to register to a location as set by your app. val connectionConfig = ConnectionConfiguration.BluetoothConnectionConfiguration(``\n  \n\n`\"{{LOCATION_ID}}\"`\n\n`) Terminal.getInstance().connectBluetoothReader(selectedReader, connectionConfig, readerListener, object : ReaderCallback() {    override fun onSuccess(reader: Reader) {     println(\"Successfully connected to reader\")   }    override fun onFailure(e: TerminalException) {     e.printStackTrace()   } })`\n\nDon’t program your app to call `disconnectReader` to conserve power. The reader efficiently handles power management using its standby mode.\n\n### Handle reader disconnects ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nReader disconnects can sometimes occur between your app and the reader. For example, the reader can disconnect from your app if it’s out of range or runs out of battery. You can simulate an unexpected disconnect while testing by powering off the reader.\n\nThe `ReaderListener` includes a `onDisconnect` callback that provides your application with the `DisconnectReason` to help identify why the reader disconnected.\n\nWhen a reader disconnects, we recommend you automatically attempt reconnection and display notifications in your app relaying the reader status throughout the process.\n\nTo implement automatic reconnection:\n\n1.  Set `autoReconnectOnUnexpectedDisconnect` to true on the `ConnectionConfiguration`.\n2.  Implement the callbacks found in the `ReaderReconnectionListener`.\n3.  Pass a `bluetoothReaderReconnectionListener` to your `ConnectionConfiguration`.\n    \n    `val bluetoothReaderReconnectionListener = yourReconnectionListener  Terminal.getInstance().connectBluetoothReader(     reader,     BluetoothConnectionConfiguration(connectLocationId, true, bluetoothReaderReconnectionListener),     readerListener,     readerCallback, )`\n    \n4.  When the SDK sends [onReaderReconnectStarted](https://stripe.dev/stripe-terminal-android/external/com.stripe.stripeterminal.external.callable/-reader-reconnection-listener/index.html#2086493177%2FFunctions%2F-405186196) to your app, display a message announcing that the reader lost connection and reconnection is in progress.\n    *   You can use the `Cancelable` object to stop the reconnection attempt at any time.\n5.  When the SDK indicates successful reconnection by sending [`onReaderReconnectSucceeded`](https://stripe.dev/stripe-terminal-android/external/com.stripe.stripeterminal.external.callable/-reader-reconnection-listener/index.html#677433242%2FFunctions%2F-405186196), display a message announcing the connection was restored and to continue normal operations.\n6.  If the SDK can’t reconnect to the reader and sends [`onReaderReconnectFailed`](https://stripe.dev/stripe-terminal-android/external/com.stripe.stripeterminal.external.callable/-reader-reconnection-listener/index.html#-1023342536%2FFunctions%2F-405186196), display a message stating that an unexpected disconnect occurred.\n\n`val readerReconnectionListener = object : ReaderReconnectionListener {     override fun onReaderReconnectStarted(reader: Reader, cancelReconnect: Cancelable) {         // 1. Notified at the start of a reconnection attempt         // Use cancelable to stop reconnection at any time     }      override fun onReaderReconnectSucceeded(reader: Reader) {         // 2. Notified when reader reconnection succeeds         // App is now connected     }      override fun onReaderReconnectFailed(reader: Reader) {         // 3. Notified when reader reconnection fails         // App is now disconnected     } }`\n\nIf you don’t configure automatic reconnection, you can handle the disconnect callback to just display a message in the app alerting the user that the reader unexpectedly disconnected and initiate reader discovery and connection.\n\n`class ReaderActivity : AppCompatActivity(), TerminalListener {    // ...    Terminal.getInstance().setTerminalListener(this)    // TerminalListener   override fun onUnexpectedReaderDisconnect(reader: Reader) {     // Consider displaying a UI to notify the user and start rediscovering readers   } }`\n\n### Reboot the connected reader![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nStripe Reader M2 and BBPOS WisePad 3 automatically reboot after operating for 24 hours. However, you can force the reader to reboot and reset its 24-hour timer by using the `rebootReader` API. After this action, the reader disconnects from the SDK and then reboots. If you’re using automatic reconnect, the SDK attempts to restore the connection with the reader.\n\n`Terminal.getInstance().rebootReader(object : Callback {     override fun onSuccess() {         // Reboot succeeded and the reader will disconnect.         // If your app is using automatic reconnect the reconnect will begin.     }      override fun onFailure(e: TerminalException) {         // Placeholder for handling the error     } })`\n\n### Automatic reconnection on application start![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nStripe Terminal doesn’t automatically reconnect to a reader when your application starts. Instead, you can build a reconnection flow by storing reader IDs and attempting to connect to a known reader on startup.\n\n1.  When you successfully connect to a reader, save its serial number in a persistent data storage location, such as the [Shared Preferences API](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/shared-preferences) (Android).\n2.  When your app launches, check the persistent data storage location for a saved serial number. If one is found, call the `discoverReaders` method so your application can try to find that reader again.\n3.  If the saved serial number matches any of the discovered readers, try connecting to that reader with the matching reader object returned from the call to `discoverReaders`. If the previously connected reader isn’t found, stop the discovery process.\n\nDisplay some UI during the discovery and connection process to indicate that an automatic reconnection is happening.\n\n[](#update-reader)\n\nYour application must update Bluetooth and USB readers to apply:\n\n*   Regional configurations that keep you up to date with card network and issuer requirements\n*   Security updates\n\nRequired updates start installing on connection to the reader. You can’t use the reader until updating completes.\n\n#### Note\n\nInstalling updates requires that the reader’s battery is charged to more than 50%.\n\n### Required updates ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nWhen immediately required updates are available for the reader, the integration’s `ReaderListener` receives `onStartInstallingUpdate` with a `ReaderSoftwareUpdate`. The `ReaderSoftwareUpdate` provides the necessary details of the update including an estimate of the total update duration, indicated by `timeEstimate`. During the installation process, the Terminal’s `connectionStatus` transitions to `ConnectionStatus.CONNECTING` while the update is being installed on the reader.\n\nYour application must notify users that an update is being installed and display the progress in your UI. Make it clear why connecting is taking longer than normal.\n\nIf the required update process fails, your application’s `ReaderListener` receives `onFinishInstallingUpdate` with an exception. The connection attempt fails with the same exception unless the following conditions are met:\n\n*   The reader’s software version has been updated to the latest version for the location within the last 30 days.\n*   The Android SDK version is greater than or equal to `3.5.0`.\n\nIf the conditions are met, the connection process succeeds despite the required update being incomplete. Stripe retries the required update the next time you connect to that reader until it’s successfully installed.\n\n`class ReaderActivity : AppCompatActivity(), ReaderListener {      // ...      // ReaderListener      override fun onStartInstallingUpdate(update: ReaderSoftwareUpdate, cancelable: Cancelable) {         // Show UI communicating that a required update has started installing     }      override fun onReportReaderSoftwareUpdateProgress(progress: Float) {         // Update the progress of the install     }      override fun onFinishInstallingUpdate(update: ReaderSoftwareUpdate?, e: TerminalException?) {         // Report success or failure of the update     }      // ... }`\n\nYou can cancel required updates using the `Cancelable` object. However, this will result in a failed connection to the reader. For incremental-only updates no `Cancelable` is provided as these updates can not be canceled.\n\n### Optional updates ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nYou can defer optional updates until the specified date, after which they become required. The SDK notifies you of optional updates through the `BluetoothReaderDelegate` at any time the reader is connected but not performing a transaction. If an optional update is available, your application’s `BluetoothReaderDelegate` receives the `didReportAvailableUpdate` callback with the `ReaderSoftwareUpdate` object containing the update details, including:\n\n*   Estimated of update duration (`estimatedUpdateTime`)\n*   Date after which the update becomes required (`requiredAt`).\n\nThe update is also stored on the reader object as `reader.availableUpdate`. Call `Terminal.installAvailableUpdate` to install the update.\n\nIn your application, notify users that an update is available, and display a prompt to optionally continue with the update.\n\nTo proceed with the update, call `installAvailableUpdate`, which will install the update previously reported via `didReportAvailableUpdate`.\n\nAs the update proceeds, block the user from leaving the page in your app, and instruct the user to keep the reader in range and powered on until the update completes. We recommend also providing your user with a visual indicator of the update’s progress. The `BluetoothReaderDelegate` reports the update’s progress in the `didReportReaderSoftwareUpdateProgress` method.\n\nWhen an optional update’s `requiredAt` date has passed, the update won’t be installed until the reader is disconnected and reconnected.\n\n``class ReaderActivity : AppCompatActivity(), ReaderListener {      // ...      // ReaderListener      override fun onReportAvailableUpdate(update: ReaderSoftwareUpdate) {         // An update is available for the connected reader. Show this update in your application.         // This update can be installed using `Terminal.shared.installAvailableUpdate`.     }      // ... }``\n\nSee [Testing reader updates](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/references/testing#simulated-reader-updates) to learn more about making sure your application handles the different update types that a reader can have.\n\nThe BBPOS and Chipper™ name and logo are trademarks or registered trademarks of BBPOS Limited in the United States and/or other countries.

Locate the connect account’s **Account claim status**.\n    *   If the status is **Not claimed, no attempts left**, navigate to the overflow menu () and select the option to **Reset account claim attempts**.\n    *   If the status is **Not claimed** and the payee is still struggling with access, check that you have the most up to date information on file for the account and if required, send a new pre-filing confirmation invite to the connect account.\n\n**Account claim status** has the following values:\n\n*   **Claimed**: the connected account has completed account claim and has access to the Stripe Express dashboard.\n*   **Not claimed, no attempts left**: the connected account has exhausted their attempts to complete account claim and the platform must reset them.\n*   **Not claimed**: the connected account has either not attempted yet or still has account claim attempts remaining.\n\n### A connected account wants to use their business tax details instead of their personal details (or vice versa) on their 1099 tax form![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe tax details that appear on the 1099 tax form are determined by a connected account’s [business type](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information-taxes#required-information). The IRS expects to see an SSN provided on 1099 forms for Single Person Entities (SPEs). To change the tax details that appear on the form, you can update the connected account’s business type by:\n\n1.  Collect the following details from the connected account:\n    *   Desired legal entity type\n    *   Desired legal entity name and TIN\n2.  Locate the connected account, navigate to **Business details**, and select **Edit**.\n3.  Select **Change business type** and choose the desired **Type of business** and **Business structure**.\n4.  Follow the prompts to enter the new legal entity details for the connected account’s business.\n5.  Return to the [1099 tab](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/taxes/forms) of the Tax Forms dashboard and verify that the name and TIN on the 1099 tax form match what was shared with you from the connected account.\n6.  If necessary, edit the 1099 tax form with the newly supplied information.\n\n#### Note\n\nOnly certain user roles can update this information in the Dashboard, such as the Connect Onboarding Analyst or an Admin. Tax Analysts can’t edit connected account information. See [Team roles](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/teams) documentation for more information.

The forms are filed with the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and, if required, state tax departments. Forms must be delivered to recipients by January 31 and can be postal mailed or sent via paperless delivery.\n\n### What is Stripe Express, and how do I access it?![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nStripe Express allows you to update your tax information, manage tax forms, and track your earnings. If you’re working with \\[Platform\\_Name\\] and earned $600 or more (within the calendar year in the US), Stripe will send an email inviting you to create an account and log in to Stripe Express.\n\n### How do I download the app?![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nIf you’d like to download the Stripe Express app, you can do so here from:\n\n*   **iOS:** [https://apps.apple.com/us/app/stripe-express/id1560214813](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/stripe-express/id1560214813)\n*   **Android:** Not available\n\n### Do I have to download an app?![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYou don’t need to download an app. You can use either the web-based portal or the Stripe Express app to access your account and tax information.\n\n### Which email address does Stripe use to send Stripe Express invitations?![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nStripe uses the email information associated with your \\[insert platform name\\] account to send you an invitation to sign up for Stripe Express.\n\nIf you’re unable to find that email, head to this [Support site page](https://support.stripe.com/express/how-do-i-get-a-new-invite-link) where you can request a new link to be sent to your email.

Why haven’t I received an email from Stripe?![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nIf you earned enough to need a 1099 form in 2023, you should have received an email from Stripe by mid-January 2024. Emails for pre-filing confirmation will be sent out starting Nov 1, 2023 - this is separate from the email you’ll receive when your form is filed by the platform in January.\n\nIf you can’t find an email from Stripe, it’s possible that:\n\n*   The may be in your spam/junk mail folder. Please search your inbox for an email titled: “Get your \\[Platform\\_Name\\] 2023 tax forms faster by enabling e-delivery”.\n*   \\[Platform\\_Name\\] does not have your most current email address on file.

If you haven’t received an email from Stripe or a 1099 in the mail, please reach out to \\[Platform\\_Name\\] to get a copy of your tax forms.\n\nYou may not have received an invitation for other reasons, such as:\n\n*   You earned less than the threshold for your form type.\n*   Your email address on file is incorrect, missing, or unable to receive email.\n*   Your specific account is unsupported on Stripe Express (in uncommon situations where multiple users are sharing the same account, or the same email address is being used on more than 20 accounts)\n\n### Will I receive a 1099 form?![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nIf you earned less than $600 over the course of the year, you may not receive a 1099 form and one won’t be generated for you unless you meet a threshold in your state. If your state has a filing threshold lower than $600, you might receive a 1099 form.\n\nYou can check your state’s requirements here: [View 1099 state requirements](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/tax-forms-state-requirements#check-1099-form-requirements-by-state).\n\n### When will I receive my 1099?![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYour 1099 tax form will be sent to you by January 31st, 2024 (note: paper forms delivered by postal delivery might take up to 10 additional business days).\n\n*   Starting November 1st, 2023: Stripe will email you instructions on how to set up e-delivery and create a Stripe Express account.

Please allow up to 10 business days for postal delivery.\n    *   \\[Platform\\_Name\\] will file your 1099 tax form with the IRS and relevant state tax authorities.\n*   April 15, 2024: IRS deadline to file taxes. You’ll need your 1099 tax form to file your taxes.\n\nIn January, we strongly suggest that you make sure all of your tax filing details and delivery preferences are up to date in Stripe Express. Your name, address, and Taxpayer Identification Number (Social Security Number /Employer Identification Number) are of primary importance.\n\n### How do I update my tax information?![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nOpen the email from Stripe and click on the “Get started” button, which will prompt you to create a Stripe Express account. After you create an account, you’ll be able to review your tax information (e.g., name, address, and SSN or EIN) and make any necessary changes via Stripe Express. Please update your information no later than mid January 2024.\n\nPlease note: If you don’t agree to paperless delivery by mid January 2024, we’ll automatically mail your 1099 tax form to the address on file, so it’s critical that your information is current, correct, and complete.\n\nYou may find that your 1099 tax form reports your SSN and you want to use your EIN (or vice-versa). If that’s the case, you’ll want to reach out to your platform to update your legal entity information.\n\nPlease note: If you’re operating as an individual, Sole Proprietorship, or Single Member LLC, the IRS will expect to see the individual owner’s Name and SSN (as opposed to Business Name and EIN) reported on your 1099 tax form.\n\n### When answering the account claim security questions, it states that my answers are incorrect, what should I do?![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nPlease reach out to \\[Platform\\_Name\\] support to confirm the information that they have on file against the information you are providing.\n\nYour SSN, EIN, or ITIN is required to file your 1099 tax form with the IRS and relevant state tax authorities.\n\n### Is my tax information secure?![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nStripe’s security tools and best practices ensure that your sensitive information is safely stored and encrypted.

Information you edit will not appear in the 1099 tax form in the Stripe Express dashboard but it is shared with \\[Platform\\_Name\\]. You should reach out to \\[Platform\\_Name\\] after you’ve made the edits you want and they can assist you with a correction. Once \\[Platform\\_Name\\] ‘files’ your correction, you will be notified via email and you will see a new 1099 tax form appear in the Stripe Express dashboard.\n\nPlease note that it can take up to 72 hours after the platform files the correction for you to be notified.\n\n### How do I get in touch with Stripe for more help?![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nIf you have a question that isn’t answered here, we recommend looking through the [1099 tax forms](https://support.stripe.com/express/topics/1099-tax-forms) or [Stripe Express](https://support.stripe.com/express) resource pages.

If you don’t remember the email address that you signed up with, check your inbox for past emails that we sent about confirming your tax information for paperless delivery. Otherwise, I’ll need to confirm the email address that is associated with your Stripe account. If you have historically accessed your Stripe Express account via your \\[insert platform portal name\\], you can continue to log in this way - however, you will now have to enter a 6-digit verification code that will be sent via SMS to the phone number associated with your account to log in. If you’ve lost or updated your phone number, you can select the “[I no longer have access to this phone number](https://support.stripe.com/express/questions/i-lost-my-phone-or-changed-my-number-how-do-i-login-to-my-account)” option to authenticate via email and change your phone number.\n\n### How do I update my phone number?

However, before doing so, it’s possible that:\n\n*   The email may be in your spam/junk mail folder. Please search your inbox for an email from Stripe.\n*   Your platform does not have your most current email address on file. Please check any other email addresses you may have used with your platform, or reach out to your platform to update your email.\n*   The email address associated with your account is incorrect, missing, or unable to receive mail.\n\n### I have multiple accounts with different emails.

The IRS requires your Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) on your 1099 tax form. If you are an individual, your Social Security Number (SSN) or Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) is used as your TIN. If you are a business, your Employer Identification Number (EIN) is used as your TIN. If you have earned enough to qualify for a 1099 tax form, the IRS requires your full details to be reported on your 1099 tax form filings. The tax authorities which receive copies of your 1099 tax form will expect to see the income on your individual or business tax return. The EIN/SSN/ITIN is crucial in connecting this information, which is why the IRS requires it.\n\n### I have claimed my account and I think the information is wrong. How do I change it?![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nTo update your personal information on your web browser, first head to the Accounts tab at the top of the page:\n\n*   Under Stripe Express Account, you can update the email address and phone number used to log in to Stripe Express. Please note that only one contact method can be updated at a time.\n*   Under Language preference, you can choose your preferred language for the dashboard.\n*   Under Payout details, you will see the platform(s) tied to your account. Once a platform is selected, you can update your bank details associated with that platform. Please note that this is only available for some accounts using Stripe Express.\n*   Under Platform settings, you will see the platform(s) tied to your account. Once a platform is selected, you can update your Professional and Personal details associated with that platform. You will also be able to invite and remove people to your account.

They receive one email per account for e-delivery.\n*   Rejected and deleted accounts: Accounts that you’ve rejected or deleted no longer have a Stripe relationship and are ineligible to login to Stripe Express\n*   Pre-filing confirmation outreach from Stripe: accounts that have missing email addresses or are below the filing threshold will be excluded from Stripe outreach.",

You can use the implementation checklist on this page to make sure that you’re ready to use e-delivery and Stripe Express for the tax season.\n\n| Action | Comments |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Configure your platform tax settings](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-tax-reporting) for the tax year, including delivery settings to enable e-delivery and early collection of identity information for connected accounts. Learn more about [e-delivery on Stripe Express](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/express-dashboard-taxes). | Enabling e-delivery and collection of tax information triggers emails from Stripe to connected accounts starting in November. |\n| Identify connected accounts that are missing email addresses and add them. | Stripe requires [an email address](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/express-dashboard-taxes#which-email-address-does-stripe-use-for-e-delivery) for each of your connected accounts to confirm tax information and e-deliver tax forms. Use the `Missing email address` filter in the 1099 dashboard to see which accounts require you to [add an email address](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/express-dashboard-taxes#how-do-i-update-the-email-address). |\n| Identify connected accounts that need updated tax information, and reach out to those accounts. | This is important to make sure you have good tax data at filing time. For more information, see [Identifying 1099 forms that need attention](https://support.stripe.com/questions/7bd66c04-b645-4749-83f2-7d2fb36bf1d1). |\n| Prep your support teams for tax season. | Grant the Tax Analyst role for anyone on your team that needs permissions to work with tax forms. For more information, see [Teams and user roles](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/teams). Also, create or update [FAQs](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/platform-express-dashboard-taxes-faqs) for internal support teams. |\n| Review edge cases that aren’t eligible for e-delivery (Stripe can only paper deliver to these accounts). | Work with your team to review these [edge cases](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/platform-express-dashboard-taxes-faqs#edge-cases-for-1099-tax-reporting). |\n| Make sure your Connect branding settings are up to date. We use those icons, colors, and the business name for Stripe emails to connected accounts. | Go to the [Connect settings page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/applications/settings). In the **Branding** section, customize the name, color, and icon of your brand. Please use a 128x128 pixel icon. |\n| Preview and test the outreach email from Stripe. | Go to the [Emails page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect/emails) and preview the outreach email. You can send a test email. |\n| Make sure that your [support email address](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/platform-express-dashboard-taxes-walkthrough#for-delivery) is up to date. We use it in the e-delivery consent dialog. | Go to your [Account details](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/account?support_details=true) page in the Dashboard and confirm the **Support email** for your platform in the **Public business information** section. |\n| Prepare to notify your connected accounts to expect an email from Stripe before e-delivery begin. | In the [1099 Dashboard page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/taxes/forms), filter for accounts with a **Pre-filing confirmation** status of **Sent** to check who’s already been emailed. Send reminder emails to accounts who’ve already been sent pre-filing confirmation emails. Suggested timing: Once outreach to your connected accounts begins, we recommend a weekly cadence for sending reminder emails. You may choose to send another reminder email prior to filing and e-delivering of 1099 tax forms in late January. For more information, see [Stripe communication timeline proposal](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/platform-express-dashboard-taxes-communication). |\n| Create a support article for your connected accounts to explain the tax timeline and your partnership with Stripe for taxes. | Example of a [support article by DoorDash](https://help.doordash.com/dashers/s/article/Common-Dasher-Tax-Questions?language=en_US).

Updates that occur to this page are automatically reflected in the form status badges and counts in the tax reporting Dashboard.\n\nFor 1099-MISC forms, the IRS requires filing if the amount of total reportable payments is $600 or more. Filing requirements for some states might differ from federal requirements.\n\nWe outline state filing requirements for 1099-MISC forms to help you identify which [states you can file directly](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/tax-forms-state-requirements) in your Dashboard, which states require a state tax registration or withholding ID when filing, and which states you’re responsible for filing directly with.\n\n#### Note\n\nIn the case of some box types, we always supply the federal threshold:\n\n1.  Royalties - $10\n2.  Payments in lieu of dividends or interest - $10\n3.  Fishing boat proceeds - $0.01\n4.  Excess golden parachute payments - $0.01\n\n#### Warning\n\nIf you have done backup withholding or state withholding, you might have additional reporting requirements with states.

When you file your 1099-MISC forms from the [Tax forms view](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/taxes/forms) in the Dashboard, Stripe submits your forms to the IRS and all qualifying states.\n\n### 1099-MISC FILING REQUIRED![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| State Portal | Stripe submits the forms directly to these states. An additional state filing fee of 1.49 USD applies per 1099-MISC form filed directly with state revenue authorities. |\n| CFSF | States listed as CFSF are part of the Combined Federal / State Filing (CFSF) program. Forms filed to the IRS are automatically forwarded to the state, eliminating separate reporting to the participating states. If forms have already been filed with the IRS, you won’t be charged an additional state filing fee for filing in these states.<br><br>Some states still require direct filing with the state, even though they participate in the CFSF program. Stripe submits the forms directly to these states. |\n| If State Withholding | You’re required to file a 1099-MISC form with that state only if you withheld state taxes. In your Dashboard, you can specify the amount withheld by updating the form and updating the `state_tax_withheld` column.

  "markdown": "# Terminal configurations | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Learn how to use the Terminal Configurations object to apply configurations to your readers.\n\nThe Terminal [Configuration](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/configuration) object contains all relevant configurations for a reader, such as the splash screen, tipping settings, offline mode, and so on. Because these settings are hierarchical, you can apply a configuration at either the account level or at the individual location level. You can set configurations in the following ways:\n\n*   On individual [Locations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/locations): Applies to all readers registered to that Location\n*   At the account level: Applies to all readers in your fleet\n\nYou can override account-level settings with location-level settings. If you don’t configure settings at the location level, they inherit the account-level settings.\n\n#### Note\n\nWe don’t support assigning or adding configurations to zones.\n\nFor example, you can model your `Configuration` objects as follows:\n\n![Configuration Hierarchy](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/configuration-object-tree.5ec745ad57500a800c4f34f0a970224e.png)\n\nIn this scenario, Location 3 inherits the configurations from the account “Default configuration”, while Locations 1 and 2 have their own configuration.\n\n#### Note\n\nIf you don’t set a configuration on the location-level, the Location inherits the default configuration on the account. For example, if you don’t set the splash screen on the Location, it inherits it from the default configuration set at the account level.\n\nAny configuration changes made with the API or Dashboard can take up to 10 minutes to reflect on the target readers.\n\n### Retrieve the account default configuration![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nStripe automatically provisions the default configuration for your account. When you set up your hierarchy, any setting that isn’t established at the location level inherits the setting from the default configuration. You can’t apply the default configuration directly to a Location. To retrieve the account default configuration, use the [configuration retrieve](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/configuration/retrieve) request:\n\n`curl -G https://api.stripe.com/v1/terminal/configurations \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d is_account_default=true`\n\n### Create a configuration for an individual location![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nTo create a `Configuration` object, use the [create configuration](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/configuration/create) request:\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/terminal/configurations \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d \"bbpos_wisepos_e[splashscreen]\"=file_1KjBJdE7XUJuZdf0F6GgO9uY`\n\nTo assign it to a location, provide the `Configuration` object you previously created to the [update location](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/locations/update) request:\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/terminal/locations/tml_DPJxAAnxbn3JQz \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d configuration_overrides=tmc_EjHtMwLT8HmATT`\n\n### Update an existing configuration![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nTo update a `Configuration` object, use the [update configuration](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/configuration/update) request:\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/terminal/configurations/tmc_EjHtMwLT8HmATT \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d \"bbpos_wisepos_e[splashscreen]\"=file_1KjBJdE7XUJuZdf0F6GgO9uY`\n\n### Delete a configuration![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nTo delete a `Configuration` object, use the [delete configuration](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/configuration/delete) request:\n\n`curl -X DELETE https://api.stripe.com/v1/terminal/configurations/tmc_EjHtMwLT8HmATT \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\"`",

[Complete your platform profile](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/settings/profile).\n4.  [Customize your brand settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect/stripe-dashboard/branding). Add a business name, icon, and brand color.\n\n[](#setup)\n\nInstall Stripe’s official libraries so you can access the API from your application:\n\n`# Available as a gem sudo gem install stripe`\n\n`# If you use bundler, you can add this line to your Gemfile gem 'stripe'`\n\n[](#create-account)\n\nWhen a user (seller or service provider) signs up on your platform, create a user [Account](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts) (referred to as a _connected account_) so you can accept payments and move funds to their bank account. Connected accounts represent your user in Stripe’s API and help facilitate the collection of onboarding requirements so Stripe can verify the user’s identity. In our store builder example, the connected account represents the business setting up their Internet store.\n\n![Screenshot of Connect Onboarding form](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/Kavholm-Seamless-Standard.78b64d90c0bf87130c8b6ba1ef53df7f.png)\n\n### Create a connected account and prefill information ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nUse the `/v1/accounts` API to [create](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/create) a connected account. You can create the connected account by using the [default connected account parameters](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/migrate-to-controller-properties), or by specifying the account type.\n\n`curl -X POST https://api.stripe.com/v1/accounts \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\"`\n\nIf you’ve already collected information for your connected accounts, you can prefill that information on the account object. You can prefill any account information, including personal and business information, external account information, and so on.\n\nConnect Onboarding doesn’t ask for the prefilled information. However, it does ask the account holder to confirm the prefilled information before accepting the [Connect service agreement](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/service-agreement-types).\n\nWhen testing your integration, prefill account information using [test data](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/testing).\n\n### Create an account link ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nYou can create an account link by calling the [Account Links](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_links) API with the following parameters:\n\n*   `account`\n*   `refresh_url`\n*   `return_url`\n*   `type` = `account_onboarding`\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/account_links \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d account=  {{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}   \\   --data-urlencode refresh_url=\"[https://example.com/reauth](https://example.com/reauth)\" \\   --data-urlencode return_url=\"[https://example.com/return](https://example.com/return)\" \\  -d type=account_onboarding`\n\n### Redirect your user to the account link URL ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nThe response to your [Account Links](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_links) request includes a value for the key `url`. Redirect to this link to send your user into the flow. Account Links are temporary and are single-use only because they grant access to the connected account user’s personal information. Authenticate the user in your application before redirecting them to this URL. If you want to prefill information, you must do so before generating the account link. After you create the account link, you won’t be able to read or write information for the account.\n\n#### Security tip\n\nDon’t email, text, or otherwise send account link URLs outside of your platform application. Instead, provide them to the authenticated account holder within your application.\n\n### Handle the user returning to your platform ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nConnect Onboarding requires you to pass both a `return_url` and `refresh_url` to handle all cases where the user is redirected to your platform. It’s important that you implement these correctly to provide the best experience for your user.\n\n#### Note\n\nYou can use HTTP for your `return_url` and `refresh_url` while in test mode (for example, to test with localhost), but live mode only accepts HTTPS. Be sure to swap testing URLs for HTTPS URLs before going live.\n\n#### return\\_url![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nStripe issues a redirect to this URL when the user completes the Connect Onboarding flow. This doesn’t mean that all information has been collected or that there are no outstanding requirements on the account. This only means the flow was entered and exited properly.\n\nNo state is passed through this URL. After a user is redirected to your `return_url`, check the state of the `details_submitted` parameter on their account by doing either of the following:\n\n*   Listening to `account.updated` webhooks\n*   Calling the [Accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts) API and inspecting the returned object\n\n#### refresh\\_url![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYour user is redirected to the `refresh_url` in these cases:\n\n*   The link is expired (a few minutes went by since the link was created)\n*   The user already visited the link (the user refreshed the page or clicked back or forward in the browser)\n*   Your platform is no longer able to access the account\n*   The account has been rejected\n\nYour `refresh_url` should trigger a method on your server to call [Account Links](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_links) again with the same parameters, and redirect the user to the Connect Onboarding flow to create a seamless experience.\n\n### Handle users that haven’t completed onboarding ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nIf a user is redirected to your `return_url`, they might not have completed the onboarding process. Use the `/v1/accounts` endpoint to retrieve the user’s account and check for `charges_enabled`. If the account isn’t fully onboarded, provide UI prompts to allow the user to continue onboarding later. The user can complete their account activation through a new account link (generated by your integration). To see if they’ve completed the onboarding process, check the state of the `details_submitted` parameter on their account.\n\n[](#enable-payment-methods)\n\nView your [payment methods settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect/payment_methods) and enable the payment methods you want to support. Card payments are enabled by default but you can enable and disable payment methods as needed. This guide assumes Bancontact, credit cards, EPS, giropay, iDEAL, Przelewy24, SEPA Direct Debit, and Sofort are enabled.\n\nBefore the payment form is displayed, Stripe evaluates the currency, payment method restrictions, and other parameters to determine the list of supported payment methods. Payment methods that increase conversion and that are most relevant to the currency and customer’s location are prioritized. Lower priority payment methods are hidden in an overflow menu.\n\n[](#accept-payment)\n\nEmbed [Stripe Checkout](https://stripe.com/payments/checkout) as a payment form directly on your website or redirect users to a Stripe-hosted page to accept payments. Checkout supports multiple payment methods and automatically shows the most relevant ones to your customer You can also use the Payment Element, a prebuilt UI component that is embedded as an iframe in your payment form, to accept multiple payment methods with a single frontend integration.\n\n### Create a Checkout Session Client-side Server-side![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nA Checkout Session controls what your customer sees in the embeddable payment form such as line items, the order amount and currency, and acceptable payment methods. When performing direct charges, Checkout uses the connected account’s branding settings. See the [Customize branding](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges?platform=web&ui=stripe-hosted#branding) section for more information.\n\nUnlike destination charges and separate charges and transfers, users (connected accounts) are responsible for handling disputes on direct charges—it’s not the responsibility of the platform.\n\nOn your server, make the following call to the Stripe API. After creating a Checkout Session, redirect your customer to the [URL](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/object#checkout_session_object-url) returned in the response.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/checkout/sessions \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -H \"Stripe-Account:   {{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}  \" \\  -d mode=payment \\  -d \"line_items[0][price]\"=  {{PRICE_ID}}   \\  -d \"line_items[0][quantity]\"=1 \\  -d \"payment_intent_data[application_fee_amount]\"=123 \\   --data-urlencode success_url=\"[https://example.com/success](https://example.com/success)\" \\   --data-urlencode cancel_url=\"[https://example.com/cancel](https://example.com/cancel)\"`\n\n*   `line_items` - This argument represents items that your customer is purchasing and that will show up in the hosted user interface.\n*   `success_url` - This argument redirects a user after they complete a payment.\n*   `cancel_url` - This argument redirects a user after they click cancel.\n*   `Stripe-Account` - This header indicates a [direct charge](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges) for your connected account. With direct charges, the connected account is responsible for Stripe fees, refunds, and chargebacks. The connected account’s branding is used in Checkout, which allows their customers to feel like they’re interacting directly with the merchant instead of your platform.\n*   (Optional) `payment_intent_data[application_fee_amount]` - This argument specifies the amount your platform plans to take from the transaction. After the payment is processed on the connected account, the `application_fee_amount` is transferred to the platform and the Stripe fee is deducted from the connected account’s balance.\n\n![Account creation flow](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/direct_charges.a2a8b68037ac95fe22140d6dde9740d3.svg)\n\n### Handle post-payment events Server-side![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nStripe sends a [checkout.session.completed](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-checkout.session.completed) event when the payment completes. [Use a webhook to receive these events](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks/quickstart) and run actions, like sending an order confirmation email to your customer, logging the sale in a database, or starting a shipping workflow.\n\nListen for these events rather than waiting on a callback from the client. On the client, the customer could close the browser window or quit the app before the callback executes. Some payment methods also take 2-14 days for payment confirmation. Setting up your integration to listen for asynchronous events enables you to accept multiple [payment methods](https://stripe.com/payments/payment-methods-guide) with a single integration.\n\nIn addition to handling the `checkout.session.completed` event, we recommend handling two other events when collecting payments with Checkout:\n\nThese events all include the [Checkout Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions) object. After the payment succeeds, the underlying [PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents \"Payment Intents API\") status changes from `processing` to `succeeded`.\n\n[](#testing)\n\nTest your account creation flow by [creating accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/testing#creating-accounts) and [using OAuth](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/testing#using-oauth). Test your **Payment methods** settings for your connected accounts by logging into one of your test accounts and navigating to the [Payment methods settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods). Test your checkout flow with your test keys and a test account. You can use our [test cards](https://docs.stripe.com/testing) to test your payments flow and simulate various payment outcomes.\n\nBy default, any charge that you create for a connected account accumulates in the connected account’s [Stripe balance](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-balances) and is paid out on a daily rolling basis. Connected accounts can manage their own payout schedules in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payouts).",

  "markdown": "# Get started with products and prices\n\n## Start modeling your business on Stripe with products and prices.\n\n[Products](https://docs.stripe.com/api/products \"Products\") and [Prices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices \"Prices\") are core resources for several Stripe integrations, including [Checkout Sessions](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions), [Payment Links](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links), [Subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing) and [Invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing).\n\nFirst, make sure you understand the overall goals of your integration project-make your design decisions before you start building it. For example, if you’re building a [Subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/creating \"subscriptions\") integration, read [designing an integration](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/designing-integration) to learn more about design decisions and [pricing models](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/pricing-models) to understand how to translate your business model on Stripe.\n\nNext, decide whether you need to create new products and prices in Stripe or import an existing product catalog from another system into Stripe. [Create new products and prices](#create-products-prices) in the Dashboard if your product catalog is small or you don’t want to use code. If you have a very large product catalog, use the [Products](https://docs.stripe.com/api/products) API to [import](#import-products-prices) your catalog programmatically.\n\n## Multiple products and prices![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYou can create as many products as you need to represent your product catalog. You can also create multiple prices for each product. Whether you should create multiple products as opposed to multiple prices depends on several factors. Generally, however, you want to:\n\n*   Create multiple prices for a single product if you’re selling the same item at different price points. For example, if you offer a subscription tier at monthly and yearly rates, create one product for the tier and one price for the monthly rate and another for the yearly rate. See an example of this for a [good-better-best flat rate pricing model](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/pricing-models#flat-rate). (If you’re selling the same item in different currencies, then instead of creating multiple prices, create a single [multi-currency Price](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/pricing-models#multicurrency \"multi-currency price\").)\n    \n*   Create multiple products if the items require different provisioning or fulfillment in your application. In the [good-better-best](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/pricing-models#flat-rate) model, for example, you would create a different product for each tier. Similarly, if you have different versions of a product, like different colors or sizes of a t-shirt, you would create a product for each version.\n    \n\n### Test mode![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYou can copy products from test mode to live mode so that you don’t need to recreate them. Prices associated with the product are also copied over. In the Product detail view in the Dashboard, click **Copy to live mode** in the upper right corner.\n\nYou can only copy test products to live mode once. If you make updates to the test product after the copy, the live product won’t reflect the changes.\n\n## Create products and prices ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nUsing the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/products) is the easiest way to create new products and prices. If you want to use the API, see the guide for [managing products and prices](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/manage-prices); this section only describes the Dashboard steps.\n\n### Create a product ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nTo create a product in the Dashboard:\n\n1.  Go to **More** > **Product catalog**.\n2.  Click **+Add product**.\n3.  Enter the **Name** of your product.\n4.  _(Optional)_ Add a **Description**. The description appears at checkout, on the [customer portal](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management), and in [quotes](https://docs.stripe.com/quotes).\n5.  _(Optional)_ Add an **Image** of your product. Use a JPEG, PNG, or WEBP file that’s smaller than 2MB. The image appears at checkout.\n6.  _(Optional)_ If you’re using [Stripe Tax](https://docs.stripe.com/tax), select a **Tax code** for your product. See [tax codes](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-codes) for more information about the appropriate category for your product.\n7.  _(Optional)_ Enter a **Statement descriptor**. This descriptor overrides any account descriptors for recurring payments. Choose something that your customers would recognize on a bank statement.\n8.  _(Optional)_ Enter a **Unit label**. This describes how you sell your product. For example, if you charge by the seat, enter “seat” so the line item includes “per seat” for the price. Unit labels appear at checkout, and in invoices, receipts, and the [customer portal](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/customer-portal \"customer portal\").\n\nTo save a product in the Dashboard, you must also add at least one price. You can also create multiple prices for a product. See [create a price](#create-price) to learn more.\n\n### Create a price ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nTo create a price in the Dashboard, you have to [create a product](#create-product) first. You can create multiple prices for a product.\n\n1.  Select a **Pricing model**. For more details about recurring pricing models, read the [pricing model guide](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/pricing-models).\n    \n    *   **Flat-rate pricing**: Charge the same price for each unit. If you use this option, select **One time** or **Recurring**.\n    *   **Package pricing**: Charge by the package, or group of units, such as charging 25 USD for every 5 units. Purchases are rounded up by default, so a customer buying 8 units pays 50 USD.\n    *   **Graduated pricing**: Use pricing tiers that might result in a different price for some units in an order. For example, you might charge 10 USD per unit for the first 100 units and then 5 USD per unit for the next 50. If you use this option, select the currency for the price and fill in the tier table.\n    *   **Volume pricing**: Charge the same price for each unit based on the total number of units sold. For example, you might charge 10 USD per unit for 50 units, and 7 USD per unit for 100 units. If you use this option, select the currency for the price and fill in the tier table.\n    \n    *   **Customer chooses price**: Let the payer decide on the amount to pay for your product, service, or cause. **Customer chooses price** is only compatible with Checkout and Payment Links.\n    \n    *   **Usage-based pricing**: Charge your customers based on how much of your service they use during the billing cycle.\n2.  _(Optional)_ If you’re selling in multiple currencies, click **Add another currency** to set how much to charge in each currency.\n    \n3.  Select a **Billing period** for recurring prices. You can add a custom period if none of the drop-down options are what you want.\n    \n4.  Select whether to **Include tax in price**. Learn more about [taxes and subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/taxes).\n    \n5.  _(Optional)_ Enter a **Price description**. Customers don’t see this description.\n    \n6.  Click **Create price** to save the price. You can [edit the price](#edit-price) later.\n\n## Import products and prices ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nIf you have a very large product catalog, use the [Products](https://docs.stripe.com/api/products) API to import your catalog programmatically. If you’re importing your product catalog to Stripe, you can use anything as your starting data source, like a product management system or CSV file.\n\nUse the [Products](https://docs.stripe.com/api/products) API to create a product in Stripe for each product in your system. To map products in your system to products in Stripe, assign each product that you import a unique [`id`](https://docs.stripe.com/api/products/create#create_product-id). For each product, use the [Prices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices) API to make a corresponding price. Make sure to store the `id` of the newly created price. You’ll need to pass this `id` when you [use the products and prices](#use-products-and-prices) in your integration.\n\nConfirm the import by checking the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/products) or using the API to [list all products](https://docs.stripe.com/api/products/list).\n\n### Deleting prices![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nDuring development, you might need to run this script multiple times for testing. If you use the same Product ID, you’ll see an error stating that a Product with that ID already exists. If you haven’t used the Product yet, you can delete it using the Stripe Dashboard:\n\n1.  Go to the Products [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/products) and find your Product.\n    \n2.  In the **Pricing** section, click the overflow menu () next to the Price and select **Delete Price**.\n    \n3.  Click the overflow menu () at the top of the page, and select **Delete Product**.\n    \n\n### Synchronize products and prices![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYou’ll likely need to run through an import more than once. You can create a script to test the import and, if you want to, synch your original data source with Stripe. To make your script idempotent and resilient to errors, you can safely try to create the product first, then update it if the product already exists.\n\nTo keep your product catalog synchronized with Stripe, use webhooks or other mechanisms to trigger product updates in Stripe. To [update a product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/products/update) programmatically, use the following pattern.\n\nFirst, find the existing price associated with the product with [list all prices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices/list) API to make sure the price still matches your data source. Each product should have exactly one active price.\n\n`curl -G https://api.stripe.com/v1/prices \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d product=  {{PRODUCT_ID}}   \\  -d active=true`\n\nNext, check whether the decimal amount of the price has changed. The `unit_amount_decimal` [field](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices/object#price_object-unit_amount_decimal) displays the unit amount in cents.\n\nIf the amount doesn’t match, you have to create a new price. When you [create a new price](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices/create), specify the `product` ID of the original product, the `currency`, and the updated `unit_amount` price.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/prices \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d product=  {{PRODUCT_ID}}   \\  -d unit_amount=2000 \\  -d currency=usd`\n\nFinally, [update the old price](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices/update) to mark it as `active=false`.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/prices/`\n\n`{{PRICE_ID}}`\n\n `\\  -u \"  sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc  :\" \\  -d active=false`\n\n## Use products and prices![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nNow that you have products and prices in Stripe, you can use them in an integration.",

  "markdown": "# Planning considerations | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Identify essential integration decisions and considerations.\n\nBefore you start building your integration, make sure that everyone impacted by the move to Stripe understands their requirements. This guide identifies the integration decisions and considerations you need when using Stripe for the first time.\n\n[](#structure-stripe-accounts)\n\nOne of the first questions to answer is whether you’ll need a single Stripe account, or several. To learn more, see our [account overview](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account).\n\n### Considerations ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\n*   **Which countries will you operate in?**\n    \n    If more than one, consider creating ​​Stripe accounts where you have legal entities to take advantage of local acquiring for local customers.\n    \n    In some countries, Stripe supports adding [multiple bank accounts for different currencies](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts#supported-accounts-and-settlement-currencies), which might impact the number of accounts you create.\n    \n    For example, if you have legal entities in the United States, Canada, and the Netherlands, and plan to pay out to bank accounts in multiple currencies, you might choose to have a US account for USD [payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts \"payout\"), a CA account for CAD payouts, and one NL account capable of settling in EUR, GBP, and DKK. This account organization allows you to benefit from local acquiring and separate payouts by business line.\n    \n*   **Do you need to direct funds to more than one bank account?**\n    \n    If both bank accounts are in the same currency, create separate Stripe accounts to take advantage of automatic payouts and avoid manually switching between bank accounts for each payout.\n    \n*   **How will you create your accounts?**\n    \n    You need to complete account setup for each Stripe account. To set up regional Stripe accounts, add new accounts using your [first Stripe account](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/multiple-accounts) to streamline authentication and access.\n    \n    If your integration requires multiple Stripe accounts, it’s important to know which account you’re operating in. You need to specify the [secret key](https://docs.stripe.com/api/authentication) on each API request to correctly identify the regional account.\n    \n    If you’re going to use a single account for Stripe transactions and charge customers in every currency, you only need to go through account setup one time. This account organization guarantees that all data is available in a single account, which streamlines the integration and reporting process. You can also create additional Stripe accounts later for different geographies if needed.\n    \n*   **Can you benefit from local acquiring?**\n    \n    To benefit from local acquiring, you need to have regional accounts.\n    \n*   **Do you need centralized reporting in a single Stripe account?**\n    \n    | Options | Regional | Unified |\n    | --- | --- | --- |\n    | **Description** | A more complex integration that uses multiple regional Stripe accounts to manage multiple bank accounts or acquire in local currencies. Requires a local legal entity for each Stripe account. | The simplest integration that uses a single Stripe account for charging customers in every currency and specific payment methods depending on the account’s location. |\n    | **Benefits** | *   Acquire in the local market with the most support for new payment methods.<br>*   Eliminate FX and settles into like currency.<br>*   Achieve higher authorization rates and lower network costs | *   Unify reporting under a single Stripe account for all markets.<br>*   Avoid developing internal logic for routing customer transactions to the correct Stripe account for processing. |\n    | **Limitations** | *   Adds complexity to reporting and integration.<br>*   Lacks a holistic Dashboard view of data. | *   Some payment methods might not be compatible.<br>*   Necessitates cross-border acquiring and settlement FX. |\n    \n\n[](#how-accept-payments)\n\n[PaymentIntents](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents) is our default API. PaymentIntents track the lifecycle of a customer’s payment flow ​​and enable you to integrate against asynchronous payment flows like [3D Secure](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure \"3D Secure (3DS)\"). Asynchronous flows are especially important when it comes to supporting global expansion (for example, [SCA](https://docs.stripe.com/strong-customer-authentication), compliance with 3D Secure in Europe (and similar regulations in India), and introducing other payment methods such as SEPA Direct Debit or SOFORT in Europe.\n\n### Considerations ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\n*   **Which [payment methods](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods) will you offer your customers?**\n    \n    To see which payment methods the PaymentMethods API supports, check for [digital wallets](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/wallets#product-support), [bank debits](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/bank-debits#product-support), [bank redirects](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/bank-redirects#product-support), [buy now, pay later](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/buy-now-pay-later#product-support), and [vouchers](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/vouchers#product-support).\n    \n*   **Which countries will you operate in?**\n    \n    If your business is based in the [European Economic Area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Economic_Area \"European Economic Area\") (EEA) and you serve customers in the EEA, you must integrate on PaymentIntents to comply with SCA regulations. ​​If your business is based in India and serving customers in India, we also recommend using PaymentIntents.\n    \n*   **Which payment methods and countries are on your roadmap?**\n    \n    If you don’t require PaymentIntents today but plan to expand to new payment methods or countries, we recommend that you integrate with PaymentIntents for all methods that are currently available as PaymentMethods, and plan your [migration to PaymentIntents](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents/migration) for the remaining methods when they become available on the [PaymentMethods API](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods).\n    \n\n[](#how-capture-payment-details)\n\nThe client-side integration process typically involves building components for Stripe. Use our [website checklist](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/checklist/website) to make sure you’re following best practices and standards for your frontend development.\n\nThe [Integration security guide](https://docs.stripe.com/security) helps you ensure [PCI compliance](https://docs.stripe.com/security/guide#validating-pci-compliance \"PCI compliance\") and explains the importance of secure communication between your customer and your servers.\n\n### Considerations ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\n*   **Is your business already PCI-compliant?**\n    \n    If yes, and you want to process cards without tokenizing, speak to your Stripe contact or [support.stripe.com](https://support.stripe.com/).\n    \n*   **Will you be using multiple payment processors?**\n    \n    If yes, consider dual-tokenization when processing card payments. Dual-tokenizing can help you to continue to run charges on your other payment processor without prompting your customers for their credit card details again.\n    \n*   **How will you manage fraud in the checkout experience?**\n    \n    To provide Stripe with additional fraud signals, include [Stripe.js](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/elements) on every page that a customer interacts with related to the checkout process. This includes product and payment pages.\n    \n*   **How much control do you need over the checkout experience?**\n    \n    Stripe offers two main ways to create payment forms: [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/elements) and [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout). Both are secure, optimized for conversion, and PCI-compliant, though they differ in terms of customizability and time to integrate.\n    \n    | Options | Stripe Checkout | Stripe.JS and Elements |\n    | --- | --- | --- |\n    | **Description** | Stripe Checkout is a secure, Stripe-hosted page that lets you collect payments. It works across devices and can help increase your conversion. | Elements is a set of prebuilt UI components, like inputs and buttons, for building your checkout flow. Stripe.js tokenizes sensitive payment details without ever letting it touch your server. |\n    | **Benefits** | *   Simplified integration.<br>*   Up-to-date with available payment methods.<br>*   Optimized conversion.<br>*   Co-branded with your business logo and colors. | *   Optimized conversion with dynamic inputs.<br>*   Simplified PCI compliance with SAQ A reporting because all sensitive information is handled by Stripe.js.<br>*   Customizable styling to match the appearance of your checkout flow. |\n    | **Limitations** | *   Temporarily redirects customers off your web domain.<br>*   Fewer options for customization. | *   Increased integration time and effort compared to Checkout.<br>*   Elements doesn’t support all payment methods, requiring that you build additional fields to use unsupported methods. |\n    \n    ### Create a PaymentMethod with Stripe.js or a mobile SDK![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n    \n    If you’re using Stripe.js and Elements, tokenize payment details from a customer before creating a charge.\n    \n    At a high level, this process involves using a [publishable key](https://support.stripe.com/questions/where-do-i-find-my-api-keys) to transmit card (or other payment method) details from a client browser or mobile app directly to Stripe’s servers.\n    \n    Stripe ingests these sensitive payment details and returns a [PaymentMethod](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods) that can be charged. For users accessing the service using a web browser, use [Stripe.js](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/elements).\n    \n    If the user is submitting payment details using an [iOS](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=ios) or [Android](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=android) app, use one of Stripe’s libraries.\n    \n\n[](#how-reconcile-payments-payouts)\n\n​​Involve your finance team early in your scoping so that they can advise you on your new reconciliation process and reporting needs. To learn more about your options, start by reviewing the Payments and payouts and Financial reports Guides. Depending on your needs, you may use a combination of Financial Reports, Dashboard exports, Sigma, and the API.\n\n### Considerations ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\n*   **Do you require fast and frequent access to transaction data and payouts?**\n    \n    *   [Financial Reports](https://docs.stripe.com/reports) and [Sigma](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-data) make your data available by 12:00 UTC the following day.\n    *   Dashboard exports, while available immediately, take longer to generate, which makes them best for pulling small increments of data on the order of several thousand records—not tens of thousands.\n    *   Building custom reporting using the Stripe APIs provides access to the specific data you need as it becomes available. However, it’s resource-intensive to both build and maintain.\n    \n*   **Do you have data analytics tooling?**\n    \n    Sigma is our custom reporting tool that makes all of your transactional data available as an interactive SQL environment in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/get-started/sigma). You can use it to gain insights into anything from ARPU to customer churn, and identify new business opportunities.\n    \n*   **Which data points do you use to reconcile your finances? Are any of these fields custom and generated by your team (for example, an order or booking ID)?**\n    \n    Make sure ​​your custom data is included as [metadata](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents#storing-information-in-metadata) on any relevant reporting objects.\n    \n\n| Options | Financial reports | Sigma | Custom reports |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Description** | View the financial data within your Stripe account, helping to streamline your business workflows | Process business data using SQL.

Manual payouts don’t allow you to link the payout amount to specific transactions.\n    \n    Alternatively, consider [Instant Payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts/instant-payouts-banks) to a debit card, which facilitates remaining on automatic payouts.\n    \n*   **Do you want to retain a balance in your account?**\n    \n    Manual and Instant Payouts allow you to keep a Stripe balance of your choosing.\n    \n*   **Do you plan to reconcile between transactions on your account and payouts to your bank?**\n    \n    If yes, use automatic payouts.\n    \n\n| Options | Manual | Automatic and instant payouts |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Description** | Manually create payouts for the specified amount and currency to the bank account of your choosing. | Automatically pay out funds when they’re available and after settlement, either daily, weekly, or monthly.

Stripe offers [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar), which helps you fine-tune your fraud prevention environment, get insights about suspicious charges, and assess your fraud management performance from a unified dashboard. For businesses in many markets, and more generally for e-commerce, fighting fraud is fundamental to success.\n\n### Considerations ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\n*   **Do you encounter moderate or high fraud and dispute rates?**\n    \n    Consider employing some of these [best practices](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/prevention/best-practices) as part of your overall fraud strategy to avoid excessive chargebacks and reduce potential customer burden and losses.\n    \n*   **Would your business benefit from granular control in your fraud prevention tooling?**\n    \n    Radar allows you to choose your risk tolerance, write your own Rules to fine-tune your protection using a variety of transaction attributes, and manage custom block and review lists that enable you to quickly take action on fraud.",

  "markdown": "# Activate your account | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Activate your Stripe account and keep it safe.\n\nYou can begin using your Stripe account in [test mode](https://docs.stripe.com/test-mode \"test mode\") as soon as you create it. In test mode, you can simulate all of Stripe’s features without moving real money. To accept real payments, you need to first activate your account and then use live mode. If you haven’t [created your Stripe account](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register) yet, complete that process before continuing.\n\n## Activate your account ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nTo activate your account, fill out the [account application](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/onboarding) requesting some basic information about your business, product, and your personal relationship to your business. After activating your account, you can immediately start accepting live payments.\n\nStripe’s “Know Your Customer” (KYC) obligations require that we collect and maintain this information on all Stripe users. These requirements come from our regulators and financial partners, and are intended to prevent abuse of the financial system. We review the information you provide internally to make sure that it complies with [our services agreement](https://stripe.com/legal). We’ll contact you if we need any further information.\n\nAfter you activate your Stripe account, you can’t change its country. If you need to use Stripe in a different country that we support, you must create a new account.\n\n#### Caution\n\nWe take privacy and security very seriously. Our [privacy policy](https://stripe.com/privacy) explains how and for what purposes we collect, use, retain, disclose, and safeguard any personal data you provide to us.\n\n## Public business information ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nYour customers see the following details on either their card statements or in [email receipts](https://docs.stripe.com/receipts) sent by Stripe.\n\n*   Business name and website URL\n*   Business email address, phone number, and address\n*   Support site URL\n*   Statement descriptor text\n\nYou provide this information when you activate your account, and can update it any time in your [Account settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/public). Make sure that your statement descriptor text and business information are clearly associated with you. If your customer can’t recognize one of your payments, they might [dispute](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes) it.\n\nStatement descriptors are limited to between 5 and 22 characters. They must contain at least 5 letters and can’t use the special characters `<`, `>`, `\\`, `'`, `\"`, or `*`.\n\nYou can also use dynamic statement descriptors when creating a charge so that each payment has a custom statement descriptor. This dynamic text is appended to the [shortened descriptor](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/public) set in the Stripe Dashboard. Statement descriptor prefixes are limited to between 2 and 10 characters. For detailed information, see the documentation on [statement descriptors](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/statement-descriptors).\n\n## Keep your account safe ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nAfter you set up your account, you’ll want to keep it safe. Here are our recommendations:\n\n*   **Keep private information private**: Don’t share your password and keep your secret [API keys](https://docs.stripe.com/keys) confidential on your own servers. As a reminder, Stripe employees will never ask you for your keys.\n    \n*   **Don’t reuse your Stripe password**: Use a password that’s unique to Stripe. If you use your password on another site and that site is compromised, an attacker could use those stolen credentials to take over your account.\n    \n*   **Use team members to provide others with access to your account**: You can [invite others](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/teams) (with limited access) to your Stripe account so that they can log in and take certain actions.\n    \n*   **Update your computer and browser regularly**: We recommend configuring your computer to automatically download and install updates (for example, [macOS](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201541) or [Windows](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/306525)). This helps protect your system against automated attacks and malware.\n    \n*   **Beware of phishing**: All [genuine Stripe sites](https://support.stripe.com/questions/verify-you-are-on-an-official-stripe-webpage) use the `stripe.com` domain and HTTPS. If you get an email from us that you don’t expect, go directly to our site to log in. Don’t enter your password after clicking a link in an email. If you’re ever not sure it’s really us, review [Verified Stripe domains](https://support.stripe.com/questions/verified-stripe-domains) on Stripe Support.\n    \n*   **Enable two-factor verification**: When you enable two-factor authentication, you’ll need to provide an additional unique code from your mobile device to complete the login process—either received as a text message or generated through an app like Google Authenticator. This means that even if someone steals your username and password, they won’t be able to log in. To enable this feature, go to your [user settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/user).",

  "markdown": "# Mail order and telephone order (MOTO) payments\n\n## Remotely process mail order and telephone order payments using Stripe Terminal.\n\nMail order and telephone order (MOTO) processing using Stripe Terminal enables you to collect card details over the telephone or by mail using the [server-driven integration](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/setup-integration?terminal-sdk-platform=server-driven) on [Stripe Reader S700](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/setup-reader/stripe-reader-s700) or [BBPOS WisePOS E reader](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/setup-reader/bbpos-wisepos-e). You might decide to use the details collected to either charge the customer for the order or save their card details for online reuse. MOTO _isn’t_ currently supported on Stripe’s iOS, Android, JavaScript, or React Native SDKs.\n\nWhen using MOTO, enter the card information on the card reader instead of tapping or inserting. After initiating MOTO, the reader prompts you to enter the cardholder’s card number, CVC, expiration date, and postal code. The reader then displays a summary of the details you entered, and you can submit the payment for confirmation or save the card details.\n\n#### Note\n\nMOTO is a gated, paid feature that requires [P2PE](https://support.stripe.com/questions/stripe-terminal-encryption-e2ee-vs-p2pe). If you enable MOTO, the P2PE fee applies to all of your Terminal transactions. Reach out to your [sales representative](https://stripe.com/contact/sales) for more information. After we enable the changes, you must disconnect from and reconnect to your reader for the updated configuration to take effect immediately.",

  "markdown": "# Prepare for app review | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Learn how to prepare your app for Stripe's review process.\n\nStripe reviews all apps built for Terminal devices before approving them for deployment. The review process helps prevent putting payment information at risk or violating industry-standard best practices for payment devices.\n\n## App review at a glance ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nStripe reviews the [device asset version](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/features/apps-on-devices/submit#create-device-asset-version) of your app. This process doesn’t require any action from you.\n\n1.  A reviewer downloads your app and installs it on a Terminal smart reader.\n2.  Using the instructions you provided, the reviewer interacts with your app and identifies potential problems, focusing on your app’s payment collection user interface.\n3.  After the reviewer determines there are no present issues, they approve your app for deployment. Stripe [notifies you of app approval](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/features/apps-on-devices/submit#monitor-status). The reviewer might reject your app if they’re unable to follow instructions, or if the app contains features that might put payment information at risk.\n\nThe exact amount of time and effort required to review each app varies because no two apps are alike.\n\n## App review guidelines ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nUse the guidelines below to help with a timely and successful app review.\n\n### Build multi-tenant apps ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nIf you’re a platform building apps for Terminal devices on behalf of individual businesses, we encourage you to build a multi-tenant app that serves all of your users. You can build business-specific workflows, such as different image or graphics assets per business, into your app’s configuration and settings. This approach also removes the need for you to submit individual apps per business.\n\n### Prevent collecting keyed payment card numbers or PINs ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nUse the Terminal reader running the app to request payment from a customer and collect sensitive card and PIN information. The [Terminal SDK](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/features/apps-on-devices/build#discover-and-connect-a-reader) allows you to display an appropriate prompt on the device screen.\n\nMake sure that your app doesn’t display user interface elements (for example, an input field) that allow the manual entry of PINs, authentication values, or payment information.\n\n### Support test mode payments ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nDuring development and testing, use a DevKit device to [accept test mode payments](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/features/apps-on-devices/build). This allows Stripe to use a [physical Terminal test card](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/references/testing#physical-test-cards) when we review your app.\n\nIf you must accept live payments, make sure the app accepts a minimal charge amount, such as 1 USD (or equivalent in another currency).\n\n### Address technical defects ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\n[Use your DevKit](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/features/apps-on-devices/build) to identify defects before submitting your app for review.\n\nExamples of common defects include:\n\n*   The app fails to install because of an error during its build process.\n*   The app crashes before we can interact with the app’s payment UI.\n*   The app can’t detect or connect to the reader.\n\nMake sure to address the technical defects that can prevent us from successfully interacting with or using your app. We reject apps that can’t be fully reviewed due to technical defects.\n\n### Write clear and complete instructions ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nWhen you submit your app for review, assume that Stripe hasn’t seen it before. Make sure your instructions are self-contained and don’t assume any special knowledge to complete the review. We must be able to follow your instructions exactly as submitted.\n\nInclude the following with your app’s instructions:\n\n*   Login information, such as a username or password (if applicable)\n*   Fixed authentication code that remains valid indefinitely (if applicable)\n*   How to reach your payment collection UI\n*   How to exercise the app fully to highlight any problems\n\nDon’t provide credentials that permit access to sensitive information or to functionality that can cause any side effects. For example, an app that accepts orders for food must not cause any actual food preparation to occur as a result of orders placed during app review.\n\n## Submit your app for review ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nFollow the steps to [submit your app for review](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/features/apps-on-devices/submit).\n\n## Skip app review ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nYou can skip app review and move directly to deployment in these cases:\n\n*   To use the API or test your app, you can limit the [compatible\\_device\\_types](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/device_asset_versions/object#terminal_device_asset_version_object-compatible_device_types) to only DevKit device types (`stripe_s700_devkit`).\n*   If you previously uploaded a device asset version in test mode and Stripe reviewed and approved that version’s APK, you can upload it again for live mode.",

It [connects](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/connect-reader?reader-type=internet) to the Stripe Terminal SDK over the internet.\n\nThis reader is compatible with JavaScript, iOS, Android, and React Native SDKs. To view the reader’s parts and features, see the [product sheet](https://www.verifone.com/sites/default/files/2018-01/p400_datasheet_ltr_013018.pdf).\n\n## Turn the reader on and off ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nTo turn on the Verifone P400, securely plug the P400 connector cable into the port on the bottom of the reader. The cover slides over the port to hold the cable in place. Plug the power adapter into the connector cable and into a power outlet.\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/verifone-connector-cable-horz.d922bf66e6b7b9a405a86ed19a2bcbed.png)\n\nVerifone P400 connector cable\n\nThe Verifone P400 automatically turns on when connected to power. In a countertop deployment, leaving the device on for extended periods is expected. If you need to turn the reader off, remove the power source.\n\n#### Note\n\nEven when it’s not in use, leave the Verifone P400 plugged in to receive automatic software updates.\n\n## Connect the reader to the internet ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nBecause the Verifone P400 is a smart reader, its reader software communicates directly with Stripe, managing connectivity through a LAN. The reader must connect to the same local network as your application. If you’re running into issues connecting your reader to the internet follow the [troubleshooting steps](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/readers/verifone-p400#troubleshooting) to diagnose the issue.\n\n### WiFi Beta![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nIf you’re setting up a new device, follow the on-screen prompts to connect to the internet using WiFi. To start over, press the red **X** button on the keypad.\n\nTo switch networks, or connect an already online reader to a WiFi network, press **0WIFI** (**0-9-4-3-4**) on the keypad and follow the prompts. Attempting to join a new network disconnects the reader from any existing wireless connection. There’s no fallback to the previously connected network.\n\nYour WiFi network must use WPA-Personal or WPA2-Personal encryption and be password protected. WiFi isn’t supported for non-password-protected networks or enterprise networks.\n\n#### Caution\n\nConnecting over WiFi is a beta feature. For production use, have an Ethernet connection ready as a backup, in case of degraded networks or connectivity issues.\n\n#### Key mapping ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nTo access characters from the keypad, use this multi-tap key mapping scheme. The table shows which characters each key maps to, in the order they’ll appear.\n\n| Keypad Number | Characters | Keypad Number | Characters |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **0** | `0-+=_!?@$%^&/\\()[]{}<>~\\|` | **6** | `6mnoMNO` |\n| **1** | `1qz.QZ` | **7** | `7prsPRS` |\n| **2** | `2abcABC` | **8** | `8tuvTUV` |\n| **3** | `3defDEF` | **9** | `9wxyWXY` |\n| **4** | `4ghiGHI` | **\\*** | ``*,’␣”`:;`` |\n| **5** | `5jklJKL` | **#** | `#` |\n\nFor example, if your network password is **Stripe**, enter `7-7-7-7-7-7-7-8-8-7-7-7-4-4-4-4-7-7-3-3-3`.\n\n### Ethernet![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nConnect an Ethernet cable from your router to the Verifone P400, using the **ETH** port (not the **RS232** port).\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/verifone-ethernet.0a73ad6671ff1a871d6d321bd2c5d0ca.png)\n\nConnecting Ethernet cable to Ethernet port\n\nThe reader obtains an IP address using DHCP. As soon as the network cable is plugged in, the reader attempts to establish communication with Stripe.\n\n### Network priority![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe Verifone P400 resets its priority to Ethernet when rebooting. Even if previously configured for WiFi, the reader switches to Ethernet if it detects an Ethernet cable connection while starting up.\n\nIf you connect to WiFi while an Ethernet cable is connected, the reader switches to the WiFi connection. If the reader fails to connect to WiFi on the first attempt, it falls back to Ethernet connection. Otherwise, the reader continues to prioritize WiFi until rebooted.\n\n## Reader screens ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nThe reader has a few screens to indicate its connectivity state.

  "markdown": "# Troubleshoot apps on devices | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Learn how to resolve known issues with apps on devices.\n\n*   **Why won’t my app upload to Stripe?**\n    \n    If your APK is too big or your upload internet speeds are too slow, you might receive a timeout error when you upload your APK with the [Files](https://docs.stripe.com/api/files) API. Stripe enforces a 45 second timeout on its servers, and produces an error if an app isn’t uploaded within that time. To resolve this issue, upload your APK to a server with better internet (for example, an AWS EC2 instance or another VPS), and then upload to Stripe from there. The network connection between your server and Stripe servers is generally much faster than home or office connections to Stripe through an ISP.\n    \n*   **Do I have to resubmit my test-mode-approved app for approval in live mode?**\n    \n    If you obtained approval for your app in test mode and want to use the app in live mode, you must submit it again for approval. The [app review process](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/features/apps-on-devices/app-review) is the same for both test mode and live mode. Make sure to upload the exact same APK for automatic approval.\n    \n*   **Why can’t I access the device admin settings screen from my app?**\n    \n    By default, the device user can access admin settings by swiping from the left edge of the screen and tapping **Settings**. This method doesn’t work when a third-party app is the default launch app. You can use the `stripe://settings/` URI to deep-link into admin settings and then launch the URI from your app using the following code in your **Activity** or **Fragment**:\n    \n    `startActivity(   Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW)     .setData(Uri.parse(\"stripe://settings/\")) )`\n    \n*   **Why can’t I update the device language on my DevKit?**\n    \n    The reader app on the DevKit can’t currently update the device language. You can change the device language through the Android Settings app. Use `adb` to launch the Android Settings app:\n    \n    `$ adb shell am start -a android.settings.SETTINGS`\n    \n*   **Why can’t I launch or deep-link into Android Settings on Stripe devices?**\n    \n    For security and reliability reasons, Stripe blocks the Android Settings app on production Stripe devices.\n    \n*   **Why can’t I use Apps on Devices with my connected account?**\n    \n    Apps on Devices and its related APIs don’t support [connected account](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/accounts) keys. You must use your platform account key. If you want to use a connected account to isolate access from your platform account, you can instead create [restricted testmode keys](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#create-restricted-api-secret-key) on your platform account.\n    \n*   **Can I run multiple apps on my Stripe Reader S700?**\n    \n    The Stripe Reader S700 supports running multiple apps, but we don’t provide an app launcher. You must build the functionality within your apps to allow switching between apps. When you deploy your apps, you can specify the `default_kiosk_application`, which is the app that launches when the device checks for updates and after payments. You can’t use the Dashboard to configure multiple apps on a device.\n    \n*   **Can I deploy a web app on my Stripe devices?**\n    \n    You can package your web app to run on your Stripe devices. Use a framework, such as [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/), to modify your web app for compatibility with Android and generate an Android application package (APK). You can then [upload the APK](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/features/apps-on-devices/submit) in your Stripe Dashboard.\n    \n    Frameworks aren’t aware of Stripe or the [Android Terminal SDK](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/references/api), so you must create a JavaScript bridge between your web app and the SDK to send commands from JavaScript.\n    \n    Alternatively, you can use the [server-driven integration](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/setup-integration) to collect payments, which doesn’t require using the Terminal handoff client library or a JavaScript bridge. This allows Stripe to handle all payment collection commands and communication with the device.\n    \n*   **Why is my app constantly restarting?**\n    \n    The Stripe Terminal card readers restart the default app in the event of a crash. This manifests differently for production and DevKit devices:\n    \n    *   Production – If you configure your app as the default app on production devices, the app automatically restarts when there’s a crash. If the app crashes during initialization (for example, a missing or broken database migration), the device can enter a crash loop.\n        \n    *   DevKit – If you configure the Stripe payment app as the default app on DevKit devices, your app queues on the device and then becomes the primary app. If the app crashes, the Stripe payment app restarts instead.\n        \n    \n*   **Why does my app crash when processing payments with a large amount of line items?**\n    \n    If your app crashes while attempting to process a payment with a large amount of line items, the issue might be memory. The Android OS limits data sent per inter-process (IPC) to 500 KB, when saving state for your activity. To help prevent your app from crashing, you can store your data out of memory, such as in a database.\n    \n*   **What if I find a bug in a deployed app?**\n    \n    If you discover a bug in an app that’s already deployed, you can fix the issue in the app, upload a new version, and then [deploy your app](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/features/apps-on-devices/deploy).\n    \n*   **How do I view the logs for my app on production readers?**\n    \n    Stripe doesn’t expose logs on production readers. We rely on Sentry integrations for observability.\n    \n*   **I sideloaded my point-of-sale app onto a DevKit and successfully completed a payment transaction. Why won’t my point-of-sale app start after the transaction completes?**\n    \n    On Stripe readers configured for Apps on Devices, the [preferred kiosk app](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/features/apps-on-devices/deploy?dashboard-or-api=dashboard#deploy-app-version) starts after a transaction completes. On a DevKit, the device’s preferred kiosk app is only set when you include the device in a deploy group.\n    \n    To set the preferred kiosk app on a DevKit device:\n    \n    1.  Submit your app to a DevKit-only deploy group. This allows you to [skip app review](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/features/apps-on-devices/app-review#skip-app-review).\n    2.  [Deploy the app version](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/features/apps-on-devices/deploy) to a deploy group that targets your DevKit.",

  "markdown": "# Deploy your app | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Learn how to deploy your Android app to your devices.\n\nAfter Stripe reviews and approves your app for deployment, we [notify you](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/features/apps-on-devices/submit#monitor-status) by email, in the Dashboard, or through a webhook. You can then follow the instructions below to deploy your app.\n\nDuring deployment, your app is immediately sent and downloaded to your device. The device reboots to install the app. Devices reboot every 24 hours and apply any updates automatically. To check for and apply updates immediately, you can manually reboot your device.\n\n## Add or edit a deploy group ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nBefore you can add or edit a deploy group, you must create a Terminal [location](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/fleet/locations-and-zones) and add [readers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/object) to that location.\n\nAfter you create a deploy group, you can edit it at any time by clicking **edit** next to the location.\n\n1.  In the Dashboard, click **Developers** > **Apps**.\n2.  On the [Terminal apps](https://dashboard.stripe.com/terminal/apps_on_devices/apps) tab, click **Manage deploy groups**.\n3.  Click **Add deploy group**.\n4.  Complete the following steps in the **Deploy group** window:\n    *   Enter a group name.\n    *   Choose your Terminal device type.\n    *   Choose the location(s) to add.\n    *   Click **Done**.\n\n## Deploy an app version ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nYou can deploy your app after a [Stripe reviewer approves](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/features/apps-on-devices/app-review) it.\n\n1.  On the [Terminal apps](https://dashboard.stripe.com/terminal/apps_on_devices/apps) tab, choose the app that you want to deploy.\n2.  On the app details page, click **Deploy version**.\n3.  Choose a version of the approved app, then click **Next**. You can’t deploy an earlier version of an app. The app version must be newer than the currently deployed app.\n4.  Choose the deploy group, then click **Next**.\n5.  Choose your preferred kiosk app, then click **Next**. This is the default app that launches when the Stripe reader turns on. If there’s only one app to deploy, choose that app instead.\n6.  Confirm the deployment details, then click **Deploy**. The app deploys immediately.\n\n## Deploy group best practices![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYou can sort devices into different deploy groups to roll out software independently and isolate fault in case of any issues. You might have fewer or more deploy groups based on tooling, risk tolerance, and specific business needs.\n\nWe recommend the following deploy group setup:\n\n*   **Alpha** - Contains locations that correspond to your internal devkits or internal production devices.\n*   **Beta** - Contains a small number of actual user locations. You can randomly choose these locations, select them based on meaningful criteria (for example, less risky locations), or have users opt in to the Beta deploy group based on their risk tolerance.\n*   **General** - Contains all remaining actual user locations, except those in the Alpha or Beta groups.\n\nWhen your app is ready for deployment, promote deploy groups from least to most risky:\n\n|     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1   | Alpha | First, deploy to the Alpha deploy group to test your app in a way that minimizes risk to users. Discovering a bug or undesirable behavior at this stage only affects a small number of internal devices, rather than actual users and real payments. |\n| 2   | Beta | Second, deploy to the Beta deploy group. This balances exposing your app to real users and not exposing all users to potential issues. |\n| 3   | General | Finally, deploy to the General deploy group after addressing any issues or confirming that no issues existed for the Beta deploy group. |",

  "markdown": "# Optimizing your Radar Integration | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Learn how to get the most out of Stripe Radar by optimizing your integration to send a complete set of fraud signals.\n\nStripe [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar \"Radar\")’s machine learning models use many signals to distinguish between fraudulent and legitimate payments. We compute some of these signals automatically, but many of them depend on the information that your integration provides. In general, the more data your integration provides, the more successful fraud prevention can be.\n\nIf you don’t collect enough information from your customers, it can reduce the effectiveness of fraud detection. Conversely, if you collect too much information, it can negatively impact the checkout experience and result in a lower conversion rate.\n\n## Integration types![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nStripe Radar leverages the power of the Stripe network to effectively detect and block fraudulent transactions, regardless of how you integrate with Stripe. However, the way you integrate with Stripe to process payments can significantly impact the completeness of the fraud signals you send us. The more information you send about a payment, the better Stripe Radar is at detecting and preventing fraud. Using one of our recommended payment integrations allows you to get the most out of Radar. If you can’t use a recommended integration, consider including as much additional data as possible, as explained in our [recommendations](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/integration#recommendations) below.\n\n| Integration type | Radar integration quality |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Stripe Payment Links](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links) Recommended | Excellent |\n| [Stripe Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout) Recommended | Excellent |\n| [Stripe Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/elements) with Customer signals Recommended | Excellent |\n| Direct [API](https://docs.stripe.com/api) integration with [Radar Sessions](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/radar-session) and Customer signals | Excellent |\n| Direct [API](https://docs.stripe.com/api) integration with client and Customer signals | Very good |\n| Direct [API](https://docs.stripe.com/api) integration with client signals | Good |\n| Direct [API](https://docs.stripe.com/api) integration with Customer signals | Fair |\n| Direct [API](https://docs.stripe.com/api) integration with no additional signals | Poor |\n\n## Important signals to send to Stripe![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nIncluding the following information with your payments can have a significant impact on the performance of Stripe Radar’s fraud detection models. Our recommended integrations enable you to collect this information, while direct integrations might need to explicitly include this data.\n\n| Data | Estimated fraud model improvement |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Advanced fraud signals](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/prevention/advanced-fraud-detection \"advanced fraud signals\") | 36% |\n| IP address | 12% |\n| Customer email | 11% |\n| Customer name | 3%  |\n| Billing address | 1%  |\n\n## Recommendations![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nWe’ve tested the following recommendations to make sure that your conversion rate remains high while maximizing the performance of our machine learning models.\n\n#### Checklist progress\n\nAs you complete each item and check it off, the state of each checkbox is stored within your browser’s cache. You can refer back to this page at any time to see what you’ve completed so far.\n\n*   Collect advanced fraud signals automatically by using Payment Links, Checkout, Elements, or our mobile SDKs\n    \n    The most important action you can take to guard against fraud is to collect customer payment information using one of our [recommended payments integrations](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/online-payments#recommended-integrations). Each method automatically collects important high-signal data, such as device information and IP addresses. To further improve fraud detection, collect the cardholder name, full billing address, postal code, and the card’s CVC code during checkout.\n    \n    You can build a seamless checkout flow within your website or app using any of these methods, and securely pass sensitive card information directly to Stripe without passing it through your servers—greatly simplifying your [PCI compliance](https://docs.stripe.com/security/guide). Determine which integration makes the most sense for your business and product goals, but any of these integration methods help optimize your integration for fraud prevention.\n    \n    #### Note\n    \n    If you’re not using one of the recommended payment integrations, consider using [Radar Sessions](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/radar-session) to automatically collect [advanced fraud signals](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/prevention/advanced-fraud-detection) to send to Stripe. You can also pass a subset of our advanced fraud signals directly using our APIs, as shown below.\n    \n    `curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/payment_intents \\  -u \"`\n    \n    `sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n    \n    `:\" \\  -d amount=2000 \\  -d currency=usd \\  -d \"payment_method_data[type]\"=card \\  -d \"payment_method_data[card][number]\"=4000002500003155 \\  -d \"payment_method_data[card][exp_month]\"=12 \\  -d \"payment_method_data[card][exp_year]\"=29 \\  -d \"payment_method_data[card][cvc]\"=123 \\  -d \"payment_method_data[ip]\"=\"62.132.141.1\" \\   --data-urlencode \"payment_method_data[user_agent]\"=\"Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; Windows NT 6.1; Trident/5.0)\" \\   --data-urlencode \"payment_method_data[referrer]\"=\"[https://example.com/payment-page](https://example.com/payment-page)\" \\  -d \"payment_method_data[payment_user_agent]\"=\"Stripe Button\"`\n    \n    `curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/charges \\  -u \"`\n    \n    `sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n    \n    `:\" \\  -d amount=2000 \\  -d currency=usd \\  -d source=tok_visa \\  -d ip=\"62.132.141.1\" \\   --data-urlencode user_agent=\"Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; Windows NT 6.1; Trident/5.0)\" \\   --data-urlencode referrer=\"[https://example.com/payment-page](https://example.com/payment-page)\" \\  -d payment_user_agent=\"Stripe Button\"`\n    \n*   Create payments using the Customer object, where possible\n    \n    Using [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api#customers) objects when creating payments allows Stripe to track the payment patterns for each customer over time. This significantly increases our ability to identify irregularities in purchasing behavior. To do this, you should:\n    \n    *   [Set up Payment Methods for future use](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/save-and-reuse) and add a [billing address](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object#customer_object-address) to `Customer` objects and use them to create subsequent payments.\n    *   Provide your customer’s [email address](https://docs.stripe.com/api#customer_object-email) when creating a `Customer` object.\n    *   Provide your customer’s [name](https://docs.stripe.com/api/#customer_object-name) when you tokenize their card information.\n    *   If you ship physical goods, we also recommend collecting the customer’s [shipping address](https://docs.stripe.com/api#customer_object-shipping) and saving this to their associated `Customer` object.\n    \n    Each `Customer` object can also store [multiple payment methods](https://docs.stripe.com/saving-cards#multiple-payment-methods), so you can enhance your customer’s checkout experience by offering to save multiple cards. Stripe can continue to track payment patterns for each customer, regardless of which one they use.\n    \n    If you’re creating a [PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents) manually, make sure to handle [declines](https://docs.stripe.com/declines). If you reuse the PaymentIntent, you can track repeated attempts to help counter [card testing](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/prevention/card-testing).\n    \n*   Include Stripe.js on every page of your site\n    \n    Include [Stripe.js](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/elements) on every page of your site, not just the checkout page where your customer enters their payment information. By doing so, Stripe can detect anomalous behavior that may be indicative of fraud as customers browse your website—[providing additional signals](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/prevention/advanced-fraud-detection) that increase the effectiveness of our detection.\n    \n    #### Note\n    \n    Always load Stripe.js directly from **https://js.stripe.com/v3/**. We don’t support using a local copy of Stripe.js-it can result in user-visible errors, and reduces the effectiveness of our fraud detection.\n    \n*   Update your privacy policy if necessary\n    \n    Radar collects information on anomalous device or user behavior that might be indicative of fraud. Make sure that your own privacy policy tells your customers about this type of collection. Here’s a paragraph you could add to your policy if it doesn’t already include such a disclosure:\n    \n    > We use Stripe for payment, analytics, and other business services. Stripe collects identifying information about the devices that connect to its services. Stripe uses this information to operate and improve the services it provides to us, including for fraud detection. You can learn more about Stripe and read its privacy policy at https://stripe.com/privacy.\n    \n*   Consider enabling Radar for future use\n    \n    Radar operates on a per-charge level, which means that during a [PaymentIntent lifecycle](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/paymentintents/lifecycle), Radar might scan multiple charges if the payment has retries. By default, Radar doesn’t scan if you [set up a Payment Method for future use](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/save-and-reuse) _without_ a charge. If you want to scan [SetupIntents](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_intents), go to the [Radar settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/radar) and enable **Use Radar on payment methods saved for future use**.",

To view the reader’s parts and features, see the [BBPOS Chipper 2X BT product sheet](https://d37ugbyn3rpeym.cloudfront.net/terminal/product-sheets/c2xbt_product_sheet.pdf).\n\n## Turn the reader on and off ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nYou can turn on the BBPOS Chipper 2X BT reader by pressing and releasing the power button. The status light turns on to indicate power. The reader waits for a connection for five minutes before turning off.\n\nWhen the reader [connects to a device running your app](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/connect-reader), its status light shines steady blue. If inactive for more than 30 seconds, it enters standby mode to conserve power, and the status light begins flashing at 5-second intervals. The reader stays connected to your iOS or Android device while in standby and automatically exits standby mode when you resume activity.\n\nThe reader automatically turns off after 10 hours of inactivity. You can turn the reader off manually by pressing and holding the power button until the status light goes out. You don’t need to turn off the reader to conserve power.\n\n#### Note\n\nWith typical usage, you only need to fully [charge the reader](#charging) once per day.\n\n## Status light ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nWhen you turn on the BBPOS Chipper 2X BT, the LED located beside the power button shows the reader’s current status.\n\n| Light | Meaning |\n| --- | --- |\n| **None** | The reader is off. |\n| **Flashing blue every second** | The reader is on and ready to connect to a device. (Will turn off after 5 min.) |\n| **Multicolored flashing** | The reader has been discovered using [Bluetooth Proximity](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/connect-reader?terminal-sdk-platform=ios&reader-type=bluetooth#bluetooth-proximity) or USB (Android only) and is ready to connect. |\n| **Steady blue** | The reader is connected to a device. |\n| **Flashing blue every 5 seconds** | The reader is in standby mode. (Will remain in standby indefinitely.) |\n| **Alternating red and magenta** | The reader is charging. |\n| **Flashing red** | The reader’s battery is low. |\n| **Rapidly flashing blue and orange** | The reader has finished installing a software update. If the reader is unresponsive after the update completes, restart the reader by turning it off and on. |\n\n## Charge the reader ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nTo charge the BBPOS Chipper 2X BT, use the included cable or a micro USB cable.\n\nThe BBPOS and Chipper™ name and logo are trademarks or registered trademarks of BBPOS Limited in the United States and/or other countries.

  "markdown": "# Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Lists\n\n## Create your own lists of information to block, allow, or review matching payments.\n\nUsers of Stripe Radar for Fraud Teams can create lists of specific types of information and use them in [rules](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/rules). For example, you might want to create rules using a list of:\n\n*   **Customer IDs for trusted customers**. Use this list to automatically allow payments by these customers.\n*   **Email addresses you tied to fraud**. Automatically block any payment with an email address on this list.\n*   **Suspicious IP addresses**. Place payments into review that have a matching IP address.\n\nLists make rules more manageable. Instead of creating individual rules for one item at a time, you can add similar types of information to a list (for example, email addresses) for a rule to use automatically.\n\n## Default lists![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nStripe Radar includes a set of default lists to help you get started. Each of the following types of information has a separate allow and block list that your [default allow and block rules](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/rules) can reference.\n\n*   **Card BIN**\n    \n    The Bank Identification Number (BIN) of the card being used to make the payment. This is the first six digits of the card number (for example, `424242`).\n    \n*   **Card country**\n    \n    The two-letter code corresponding to the country where the card was issued (for example, `US`).\n    \n*   **Card fingerprint**\n    \n    The [fingerprint](https://docs.stripe.com/api#card_object-fingerprint) of the card being used to make the payment. The card fingerprint is a unique Stripe identifier of a particular card number (for example, bEXP6iJPROLniU). It’s a property of the [Card](https://docs.stripe.com/api#card_object) object and you can see it in the Dashboard when viewing a payment.\n    \n*   **Charge description**\n    \n    The [description](https://docs.stripe.com/api#charge_object-description) supplied with the payment.\n    \n*   **Client IP country**\n    \n    The two-letter code corresponding to the country-level geolocation of the IP address where the payment originates (for example, `GB`).\n    \n*   **Client IP address**\n    \n    The IP address from which the payment originates (for example, `13.112.224.240`).\n    \n*   **Customer ID**\n    \n    The [customer ID](https://docs.stripe.com/api#charge_object-customer) supplied with the payment (for example, `cus_AeFLnRaI51AbRi`).\n    \n*   **Email**\n    \n    The first email derived from the charge, card, or customer objects, in that order (for example, `jenny.rosen@example.com`).\n    \n*   **Email domain**\n    \n    The first email domain derived from the `Charge`, `Card`, or `Customer` objects, in that order (for example, `example.com`).\n    \n\n#### Note\n\nYou can add and remove items from these lists but you can’t edit or remove the default lists themselves.\n\n## Custom lists![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYou can create lists of your own that contain items that are a specific type of information. The types of lists you can create are:\n\n*   String\n*   Case-sensitive string\n*   Card fingerprint\n*   Card BIN\n*   Customer ID\n*   Email\n*   IP address\n*   Country\n\nUse the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/radar/lists) or the [API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/radar/value_lists/create) to create lists. To create a new list in the Dashboard:\n\n1.  Click **New**.\n2.  Enter a name for the list (we automatically generate an alias to use as a reference when writing rules, but you can override this).\n3.  Select the type of list to create.\n4.  Click **Add** to save your new list.\n\nAfter creating your new list, [add a new rule](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/rules/reference#lists) that references it.\n\nYou can edit or remove lists you’ve created by clicking the overflow menu (**•••**), and you can edit the list directly by clicking the name of the list.\n\n## Managing list items![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYou can view and remove items when viewing a list in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/radar/lists). Each item includes information about when it was added and by whom. You can filter items by value, author, and date added. Each list can contain up to 50,000 items.\n\nYou can add items to your default block list by [refunding and reporting a payment as fraudulent](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/risk-evaluation#feedback-on-risk-evaluations). Doing so takes the following actions:\n\n*   Adds the card fingerprint to your default card fingerprint block list. If the payment is made using a [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api#customer_object) object, it adds the card fingerprints of any other cards also added to the list.\n*   Adds any email address associated with the payment to your default email block list. It takes the email address from:\n    *   The `receipt_email` of the payment\n    *   The `email` of the `Customer` object that the payment was created on\n    *   Any email addresses found in the customer or payment `description` fields, and in the card’s `name` field\n\nWhen refunding a payment because of suspected fraud, make sure to specify this reason to help our machine learning systems recognize similar cases in the future.\n\nYou can also make a [charge update](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/update#update_charge-fraud_details) request using the API and set `fraud_details.user_report` to `fraudulent`. This also adds any associated cards and email addresses to your card fingerprint and email block lists.\n\nWhen adding string list items in the Dashboard, you have the option of selecting the length of time before expiration. These items are only active in the list for as long as you specify. After they expire, they’re no longer active in rule evaluation.",

  "markdown": "# Risk insights | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Understand risk factors and details about a particular payment.\n\nStripe Radar’s adaptive [machine learning system](https://stripe.com/radar/guide) determines the risk score and risk level for a payment and uses them to decide when to block or mark payments for review. The system evaluates hundreds of signals about each payment, using data from Stripe’s network across millions of businesses. The risk insights feature, available with Stripe Radar for Fraud Teams, provides a sneak peek into some of the signals that power Radar’s machine learning system.\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/risk-insights-card.ef788006b7b5d6acbb4d237386a3c4ed.png)\n\nRisk insights for payments\n\nRisk insights also includes information about the customer, such as matching the cardholder’s name with the provided email, and the success rate of transactions on the Stripe network associated with the email address. A low authorization rate may indicate suspicious behavior, because previous declines sometimes suggest past attempts at fraudulent transactions.\n\nWe also highlight geography-based information, including the billing, shipping, and, IP address locations associated with this payment.\n\n## Risk insights ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nIf you want to see more Radar’s signals, click the **Show all insights** button from the risk insights section. This opens a dialog with a list of signals to Radar’s machine learning engine.\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/risk-insights-dialog.90d9ff8cc321c3e9bab7423b07ec97c6.png)\n\nRadar’s risk insights dialog\n\n### Understand fraud factors ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\n#### Fraud factor numbers![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nSome of the signals in the risk insights dialog have badges with numbers next to them. These badges show the fraud factor for a signal on this payment. A fraud factor represents the likelihood of fraud for charges with a value similar to this signal when compared to the average transaction on Stripe. A fraud factor of 3.5x means that charges with a similar value for this signal are 3.5 times more likely to be fraudulent than average. In a higher risk payment, we expect to see some fraud factors greater than 1, and in a lower risk payment we expect to see some fraud factors less than 1.\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/risk-insights-fraud-factor.3bd00f6b09999ef71f6d258c2cc20be6.png)\n\nFraud factors\n\nHover over a fraud factor to see more information about the possible values for it. These factors will change over time as the data in our network changes. This data provides context for the distribution of fraud factors for a signal. This dialog also provides the network distribution of values for a signal, letting you know whether the current payment has a value that’s common or if it’s rare or unique in the Stripe network.\n\n#### Top fraud factors![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/risk-insights-top-fraud-factors.ef27de20a842cb7d411261e9e7757fc6.png)\n\nTop fraud factors\n\nThe **Top Fraud Factors** section outside the risk insights dialog notifies you with fraud signals when the payment has values that commonly indicate fraud. Because Radar’s machine learning detects complex patterns across hundreds of signals, it’s still possible for a charge to be correctly identified as fraud, even if none of the signals appear suspicious on an individual level.\n\nYou can also view the network of related payments, which includes any other payments made to your business using the same customer ID, IP address, or card number as the payment you’re currently viewing. This can help identify common fraud patterns, such as [card testing](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/prevention/fraud-types#card-testing) (many different cards sharing a single IP address) or trial abuse (many “customers” share the same card).\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/related-payments-highlight.f0668ec4db4273e04eb4f8f3b8910e08.png)\n\nRelated payments",

A [PaymentMethod](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods \"PaymentMethods\") stores the customer’s PayPal account information for future payments. You can retrieve the PaymentMethod synchronously using the `success_url` or asynchronously using [webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks \"webhook\").\n\nThe decision to retrieve the PaymentMethod synchronously or asynchronously depends on your tolerance for dropoff, as customers might not always reach the `success_url` after a successful payment (for example, it’s possible for them to close their browser tab before the redirect occurs). Using webhooks prevents your integration from experiencing this form of dropoff.\n\nHandle `checkout.session.completed` webhooks, which contain a Session object. To learn more, see [setting up webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks). The following example is a `checkout.session.completed` response.\n\n`{   \"id\": \"evt_1Ep24XHssDVaQm2PpwS19Yt0\",   \"object\": \"event\",   \"api_version\": \"2019-03-14\",   \"created\": 1561420781,   \"data\": {     \"object\": {       \"id\": \"cs_test_MlZAaTXUMHjWZ7DcXjusJnDU4MxPalbtL5eYrmS2GKxqscDtpJq8QM0k\",       \"object\": \"checkout.session\",       \"billing_address_collection\": null,       \"cancel_url\": \"[https://example.com/cancel](https://example.com/cancel)\",       \"client_reference_id\": null,       \"customer\": null,       \"customer_email\": null,       \"display_items\": [],       \"mode\": \"setup\",       \"setup_intent\": \"seti_1EzVO3HssDVaQm2PJjXHmLlM\",       \"submit_type\": null,       \"subscription\": null,       \"success_url\": \"[https://example.com/success](https://example.com/success)\"     }   },   \"livemode\": false,   \"pending_webhooks\": 1,   \"request\": {     \"id\": null,     \"idempotency_key\": null   },   \"type\": \"checkout.session.completed\" }`\n\nNote the value of the `setup_intent` key, which is the ID for the SetupIntent created with the Checkout Session.

When a customer successfully authorizes the billing agreement, the SetupIntent emits the [setup\\_intent.succeeded](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-setup_intent.succeeded) [webhook](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks \"webhook\") event. If a customer doesn’t successfully authorize the billing agreement, the SetupIntent will emit the [setup\\_intent.setup\\_failed](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-setup_intent.setup_failed) webhook event and returns to a status of `requires_payment_method`. When a customer revokes the billing agreement from their PayPal account, the [mandate.updated](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-mandate.updated) is emitted.\n\n[](#testing)\n\nTest your PayPal integration with your [test API keys](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#test-live-modes) by viewing the redirect page. You can test the successful payment case by authenticating the payment on the redirect page. The PaymentIntent will transition from `requires_action` to `succeeded`.\n\nTo test the case where the user fails to authenticate, use your test API keys and view the redirect page. On the redirect page, click **Fail test payment**. The PaymentIntent will transition from `requires_action` to `requires_payment_method`.\n\n[](#charge-later)\n\nWhen you’re ready to charge your customer off-session, use the [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers \"Customers\") and [PaymentMethod](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods \"PaymentMethods\") IDs to create a [PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents).\n\nTo find a `paypal` instrument to charge, [list](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods/list) the PaymentMethods associated with your Customer.\n\n`curl -G https://api.stripe.com/v1/payment_methods \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d customer={{CUSTOMER_ID}} \\   -d type=paypal`\n\nWhen you have the Customer and PaymentMethod IDs, create a PaymentIntent with the amount and currency of the payment. Set a few other parameters to make the off-session payment:\n\n*   Set [off\\_session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/confirm#confirm_payment_intent-off_session) to `true` to indicate that the customer is not in your checkout flow during this payment attempt. This causes the PaymentIntent to throw an error if authentication is required.\n*   Set the value of the PaymentIntent’s [confirm](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-confirm) property to `true`, which causes confirmation to occur immediately when the PaymentIntent is created.\n*   Set [payment\\_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api#create_payment_intent-payment_method) to the ID of the PaymentMethod and [customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api#create_payment_intent-customer) to the ID of the Customer.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/payment_intents \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d amount=1099 \\  -d currency=eur \\  -d customer={{CUSTOMER_ID}} \\   -d \"payment_method_types[]\"=paypal \\  -d payment_method={{PAYMENT_METHOD_ID}} \\   -d off_session=true \\  -d confirm=true`\n\n[](#web-user-initiated-payment-method-cancellation)\n\nA customer can cancel the subscription (Billing Agreement) through their PayPal account. When they do so, Stripe emits a [mandate.updated](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-mandate.updated) webhook. All subsequent Payment Intents using the saved Payment Method will fail until you change to a Payment Method with active mandates. When payments fail for Subscriptions, the status changes to the Subscription status configured in your [automatic collection settings](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/automatic-collection). Notify the customer of failure and [charge them with a different payment method](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/overview#requires-payment-method).",

  "markdown": "# Customer-Initiated Transactions (CIT) and Merchant-Initiated Transactions (MIT)\n\nThe card networks divide card payments into two types, depending on whether the customer is participating in the payment flow: Customer-Initiated Transactions (CIT) and Merchant-Initiated Transactions (MIT).\n\n#### Note\n\nCard networks assign different characteristics and requirements to transactions, depending on whether they’re customer-initiated or merchant-initiated. For example, a Visa transaction’s authorization validity period varies depending on its type. If you’re using the API, the [payment\\_method\\_details.card.capture\\_before](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/object#charge_object-payment_method_details-card-capture_before) attribute on the charge is the most reliable and accurate way to determine your charge’s authorization window.\n\n## Merchant-Initiated Transactions (MIT)![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nAn MIT is a transaction that you initiate without direct participation of your customer, based on a prior agreement with that customer authorizing you to store and use their credentials. For example, you operate a subscription-based business and your customer has consented to you collecting their future monthly payments using their credit card that you have on file.\n\n### Compliance![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nWhen you save a customer’s payment information, regardless of the reason, you’re responsible for compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, and network rules. Include terms on your website or app that state how you save payment method details, and require customers to opt in before you save their payment information.\n\nWhen you save a payment method, you can only use it for the specific purposes included in your terms. For example, if you want to automatically charge a saved payment method for future subscription renewals, you must first get explicit consent for that from the customer. You can collect that consent by including a “Save my payment method for automatic renewals” checkbox on the initial payment page.\n\nTo charge customers when they’re offline, include the following in your terms:\n\n*   The customer’s agreement to your initiating a payment or a series of payments on their behalf for specified transactions\n*   The anticipated timing and frequency of payments; for example, whether the charges are for scheduled installments, subscription payments, or unscheduled top-ups\n*   How you determine the payment amount\n*   Your cancellation policy for any subscription services\n\nKeep a record of each customer’s agreement to your terms.\n\n## Customer-Initiated Transactions (CIT)![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nCITs normally include all other transaction types, including any transaction where the cardholder is available to participate in the payment flow. For example, a customer manually places an order on your website.",

Note that finalizing the invoice, [when automatic](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/automatic-advancement-collection), does not happen immediately as the invoice is created. Stripe waits until one hour after the last webhook was successfully sent (or the last webhook timed out after failing). If you (and the platforms you may have connected to) have no webhooks configured, Stripe waits one hour after creation to finalize the invoice.\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed by sending an email, then based on your [email settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/billing/automatic), Stripe will email the invoice to your customer and await payment. These emails can contain a link to a hosted page to pay the invoice.\n\nStripe applies any customer credit on the account before determining the amount due for the invoice (i.e., the amount that will be actually charged). If the amount due for the invoice is less than Stripe’s [minimum allowed charge per currency](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts), the invoice is automatically marked paid, and we add the amount due to the customer’s credit balance which is applied to the next invoice.\n\nMore details on the customer’s credit balance are [here](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/customer/balance).\n\nRelated guide: [Send invoices to customers](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/invoices/sending)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create)[POST/v1/invoices/create\\_preview](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create_preview)[POST/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/lines/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_line)[GET/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/retrieve)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming)[GET/v1/invoices/:id/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming_invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/list)[DELETE/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/delete)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/add\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/add_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/remove\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/remove_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/update\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/finalize](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/finalize)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/mark\\_uncollectible](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/mark_uncollectible)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/pay](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/pay)[GET/v1/invoices/search](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/search)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/send](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/send)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/void](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/void)\n\n## [Meter Events](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event)\n\nA billing meter event represents a customer’s usage of a product. Meter events are used to bill a customer based on their usage. Meter events are associated with billing meters, which define the shape of the event’s payload and how those events are aggregated for billing.\n\n## [Meter Event Adjustment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_adjustment)\n\nA billing meter event adjustment is a resource that allows you to cancel a meter event. For example, you might create a billing meter event adjustment to cancel a meter event that was created in error or attached to the wrong customer.\n\n## [Meter Event Summary](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_summary)\n\nA billing meter event summary represents an aggregated view of a customer’s billing meter events within a specified timeframe. It indicates how much usage was accrued by a customer for that period.\n\n## [Plans](https://docs.stripe.com/api/plans)\n\nYou can now model subscriptions more flexibly using the [Prices API](#prices). It replaces the Plans API and is backwards compatible to simplify your migration.\n\nPlans define the base price, currency, and billing cycle for recurring purchases of products. [Products](#products) help you track inventory or provisioning, and plans help you track pricing. Different physical goods or levels of service should be represented by products, and pricing options should be represented by plans. This approach lets you change prices without having to change your provisioning scheme.\n\nFor example, you might have a single “gold” product that has plans for $10/month, $100/year, €9/month, and €90/year.\n\nRelated guides: [Set up a subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/set-up-subscription) and more about [products and prices](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/overview).\n\n## [Tax IDs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_create)[POST/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/create)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_retrieve)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/retrieve)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_list)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/list)[DELETE/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_delete)[DELETE/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/delete)\n\n## [Account Links](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_links)\n\nAccount Links are the means by which a Connect platform grants a connected account permission to access Stripe-hosted applications, such as Connect Onboarding.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect Onboarding](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom/hosted-onboarding)\n\n## [Account Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_sessions)\n\nAn AccountSession allows a Connect platform to grant access to a connected account in Connect embedded components.\n\nWe recommend that you create an AccountSession each time you need to display an embedded component to your user. Do not save AccountSessions to your database as they expire relatively quickly, and cannot be used more than once.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect embedded components](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-connect-embedded-components)\n\n## [Application Fees](https://docs.stripe.com/api/application_fees)\n\nWhen you collect a transaction fee on top of a charge made for your user (using [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)), an `Application Fee` object is created in your account. You can list, retrieve, and refund application fees.\n\nRelated guide: [Collecting application fees](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges#collect-fees)\n\n## [Country Specs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/country_specs)\n\nStripe needs to collect certain pieces of information about each account created. These requirements can differ depending on the account’s country. The Country Specs API makes these rules available to your integration.\n\nYou can also view the information from this API call as [an online guide](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information).\n\n## [Person](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/create)[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/update)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/retrieve)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/list)[DELETE/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/delete)\n\n## [Transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/transfers)\n\nA `Transfer` object is created when you move funds between Stripe accounts as part of Connect.\n\nBefore April 6, 2017, transfers also represented movement of funds from a Stripe account to a card or bank account. This behavior has since been split out into a [Payout](#payout_object) object, with corresponding payout endpoints. For more information, read about the [transfer/payout split](https://docs.stripe.com/transfer-payout-split).\n\nRelated guide: [Creating separate charges and transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n\n## [Secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/secret_management)\n\nSecret Store is an API that allows Stripe Apps developers to securely persist secrets for use by UI Extensions and app backends.\n\nThe primary resource in Secret Store is a `secret`. Other apps can’t view secrets created by an app. Additionally, secrets are scoped to provide further permission control.\n\nAll Dashboard users and the app backend share `account` scoped secrets.

Set up a [webhook endpoint](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks/quickstart) to listen for product availability and delivery updates.\n\n## Using product webhook events![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n### [`climate.product.created`](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-climate.product.created)\n\nStripe sends this event when Frontier adds a new product to the [carbon removal inventory](https://docs.stripe.com/climate/orders/carbon-removal-inventory). Use this event to keep your application up to date on the latest available products from Frontier.\n\n### [`climate.product.pricing_updated`](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-climate.product.pricing_updated)\n\nStripe sends this event when the price changes for a product. We’ll notify you by email two weeks in advance, and then send this event when the price changes. Prices never change for confirmed orders. If we update the availability of a product, we’ll only notify you through this event.\n\n## Using order webhook events![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYou receive an event anytime the status of your order changes.\n\n### [`climate.order.delivered`](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-climate.order.delivered)\n\nWhen Frontier delivers your order, Stripe sends the [climate.order.delivered](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-climate.order.delivered) event. This event confirms that Frontier has received carbon removal from the supplier, verified the delivery, and retired the carbon removal units on behalf of you or your designated beneficiary.\n\n### [`climate.order.delayed`](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-climate.order.delayed)\n\nIf Frontier is unable to fulfill your order by the delivery date, Stripe sends the [climate.order.delayed](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-climate.order.delayed) event and an email at least 60 days before the end of the delivery year. The event includes the order’s updated `expected_delivery_year`.\n\nYou can decide whether to accept the delay or [cancel the order](https://docs.stripe.com/api/climate/order/cancel) within 30 days to receive a full refund. If you don’t take any action, we’ll attempt to deliver the tons by the updated `expected_delivery_year`.\n\n### [`climate.order.product_substituted`](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-climate.order.product_substituted)\n\nIf you’re ordering a product from an individual supplier and the supplier fails, Frontier tries to substitute the product with a similar one from another supplier in the Frontier portfolio. Stripe sends the [climate.order.product\\_substituted](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-climate.order.product_substituted) event along with an email with replacement details at least 60 days before the end of the delivery year. If you don’t want a substitute, you can [cancel the order](https://docs.stripe.com/api/climate/order/cancel) within 30 days and receive a full refund.\n\n### [`climate.order.canceled`](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-climate.order.canceled)\n\nIf Frontier can’t fulfill your order within 2 years of the original expected delivery date, you receive a full refund. We expect this to be a rare circumstance because we actively manage the portfolio to minimize delivery risk.\n\nFrontier makes cancellation decisions at least 60 days before the order is due. When an order is canceled, Stripe sends an email and the [climate.order.canceled](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-climate.order.canceled) event.",

By purchasing the Frontier offtake portfolio, you accelerate the development of a range of carbon removal technologies while simultaneously maximizing the likelihood that your tons are delivered by the expected delivery year.\n\nThe portfolio currently includes Charm, Heirloom, CarbonCapture, and Lithos. Frontier conducts diligence on carbon removal technologies to grow this portfolio as the industry evolves.\n\nA 3% fee is charged when buying the portfolio.\n\n| Product | ID  | Expected delivery year | Price per metric ton |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Frontier offtake portfolio | `climsku_frontier_offtake_portfolio_2027` | 2027 | 550 USD |\n\nTo provide users with price certainty, we take on the underlying pricing risk. If the actual price per ton delivered is less than price per ton sold, we’ll use all excess funds to buy more carbon removal. If the actual price per ton delivered is greater than the price per ton sold—for example, if only the more expensive suppliers can deliver—the price doesn’t change for you and the losses are borne by us.\n\nWe aim to fulfill orders from a diverse set of suppliers within Frontier’s offtake portfolio. However, we won’t fractionalize deliveries in quantities less than 1 ton (for example, an order for 4 tons might include deliveries from up to 4 suppliers).\n\n### Buy from individual suppliers![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nIf you’re excited about a particular technology or want to align purchases with company-specific attributes (for example, geography), you can also purchase from individual suppliers.\n\nA 5% fee is charged when ordering from these suppliers.\n\n| Product | ID  | Pathway | Locations | Expected delivery year | Price per metric ton |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Lithos 2025 | `climsku_lithos_2025` | Enhanced weathering | San Francisco, CA, US | 2025 | 390 USD |\n| Charm Industrial 2026 | `climsku_charm_industrial_2026` | Biomass carbon removal and storage | San Francisco, CA, US | 2026 | 630 USD |\n| Vaulted 2026 | `climsku_vaulted_2026` | Biomass carbon removal and storage | Houston, TX, US | 2026 | 424 USD |\n| Carbon Capture Inc. 2027 | `climsku_carbon_capture_inc_2027` | Direct air capture | Los Angeles, CA, US | 2027 | 510 USD |\n| Heirloom 2027 | `climsku_heirloom_2027` | Direct air capture | Brisbane, CA, US | 2027 | 990 USD |\n\n## Pricing![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nOur goal is to bring new buyers into the market, not to make money.

  "markdown": "# giropay payments with Sources | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Use Sources to accept payments using giropay, a popular payment method in Germany.\n\n#### Warning\n\nWe deprecated the Sources API and plan to remove support for local payment methods. If you currently integrate with giropay using the Sources API, you must [migrate to the Payment Methods API](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/transitioning). We’ll send email communication with more information about this end of support.\n\nFor information about integrating giropay with the current APIs, see [giropay payments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/giropay).\n\nStripe users in Europe and the United States can accept giropay payments from customers in Germany using [Sources](https://docs.stripe.com/sources).\n\nDuring the payment process, a [Source](https://docs.stripe.com/api#sources) object is created and your customer is redirected to their bank’s website or mobile application to authorize the payment. After completing this, your integration can use the source to make a charge request to complete the payment.\n\ngiropay is a [push](https://docs.stripe.com/sources#pull-or-push-of-funds)\\-based, [single-use](https://docs.stripe.com/sources#single-use-or-reusable) and [synchronous](https://docs.stripe.com/sources#synchronous-or-asynchronous-confirmation) method of payment. This means your customer takes action to send the amount to you through a [redirect](https://docs.stripe.com/sources#flow-for-customer-action) and there is immediate confirmation about the success or failure of a payment.\n\n[\n\n## Create a Source object![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n\n\n](#create-source)\n\nA `Source` object is either created client-side using [Stripe.js](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/elements) or server-side using the [Source creation endpoint](https://docs.stripe.com/api#create_source), with the following parameters:\n\n| Parameter | Value |\n| --- | --- |\n| `type` | **giropay** |\n| `amount` | A positive integer in the [smallest currency unit](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#zero-decimal) representing the amount to charge the customer (for example, **1099** for a 10.99 EUR payment). |\n| `currency` | **eur** (giropay must always use Euros) |\n| `owner[name]` | The full name of the account holder. |\n| `redirect[return_url]` | The URL the customer should be redirected to after the authorization process. |\n| `statement_descriptor` (optional) | A custom statement descriptor for the payment. |\n\nTo create a source with [Stripe.js](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/elements), first include the library within your website and set your [publishable API key](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys). Once included, use the following `createSource` method to create a source client-side:\n\n`stripe.createSource({   type: 'giropay',   amount: 1099,   currency: 'eur',   owner: {     name: 'Jenny Rosen',   },   redirect: {     return_url: '__TOKEN_PLACEHOLDER_0__',   }, }).then(function(result) {   // handle result.error or result.source });`\n\nUsing either method, Stripe returns a `Source` object containing the relevant details for the method of payment used. Information specific to giropay is provided within the `giropay` subhash.\n\n`{   \"id\": \"src_16xhynE8WzK49JbAs9M21jaR\",   \"object\": \"source\",   \"amount\": 1099,   \"client_secret\": \"src_client_secret_UfwvW2WHpZ0s3QEn9g5x7waU\",   \"created\": 1445277809,   \"currency\": \"eur\",   \"flow\": \"redirect\",   \"livemode\": true,   \"owner\": {`\n\n### Source creation in mobile applications![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nIf you’re building an iOS or Android app, you can implement sources using our mobile SDKs. Refer to our sources documentation for [iOS](https://docs.stripe.com/mobile/ios/sources) or [Android](https://docs.stripe.com/mobile/android/sources) to learn more.\n\n### Optional: Providing a custom statement descriptor ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\ngiropay requires a [statement descriptor](https://support.stripe.com/questions/when-i-charge-a-customer-what-will-they-see-on-their-card-statements) before the customer is redirected to authenticate the payment. By default, your Stripe account’s statement descriptor is used (you can review this in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/public)). You can provide a custom descriptor by specifying `statement_descriptor` when creating a source. giropay statement descriptors support a maximum of 35 characters.\n\n`stripe.createSource({   type: 'giropay',   amount: 1099,   currency: 'eur',   statement_descriptor: 'ORDER AT11990',   owner: {     name: 'Jenny Rosen',   },   redirect: {     return_url: '__TOKEN_PLACEHOLDER_0__',   }, }).then(function(result) {   // handle result.error or result.source });`\n\nProviding a custom statement descriptor within a subsequent charge request has no effect.\n\n## Error codes![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nSource creation for giropay payments may return any of the following errors:\n\n| Error | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `payment_method_not_available` | The payment method is currently not available. You should invite your customer to fallback to another payment method to proceed. |\n| `processing_error` | An unexpected error occurred preventing us from creating the source. The source creation should be retried. |\n\n[\n\n## Have the customer authorize the payment![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n\n\n](#customer-action)\n\nWhen creating a source, its status is initially set to `pending` and cannot yet be used to make a charge request. Your customer must authorize a giropay payment to make the source chargeable. To allow your customer to authorize the payment, redirect them to the URL provided within the`redirect[url]` attribute of the `Source` object.\n\nAfter the authorization process, your customer is redirected back to the URL provided as a value of `redirect[return_url]`. This happens regardless of whether authorization was successful or not. If the customer has authorized the payment, the `Source` object’s status is updated to `chargeable` and it is ready to use in a charge request. If your customer declines the payment, the status transitions to `failed`.\n\nStripe populates the `redirect[return_url]` with the following GET parameters when returning your customer to your website:\n\n*   `source`: a string representing the original ID of the `Source` object\n*   `livemode`: indicates if this is a live payment, either `true` or `false`\n*   `client_secret`: used to confirm that the returning customer is the same one who triggered the creation of the source (source IDs are not considered secret)\n\nYou may include any other GET parameters you may need when specifying `redirect[return_url]`. Do not use the above as parameter names yourself as these would be overridden by the values we populate.\n\n### Mobile applications![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nTo integrate giropay within a mobile application, provide your application URI scheme as the `redirect[return_url]` value. By doing so, your customers are returned to your app after completing authorization. Refer to our Sources documentation for [iOS](https://docs.stripe.com/mobile/ios/sources) or [Android](https://docs.stripe.com/mobile/android/sources) to learn more.\n\n### Testing the redirect process![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nWhen creating a `Source` object using your test API keys, you can follow the URL returned in the `redirect[url]` field. This leads to a Stripe page that displays information about the API request, and where you can either authorize or cancel the payment. Authorizing the payment redirects you to the URL specified in `redirect[return_url]`.\n\nAlternatively, to accelerate testing, use the following value for `owner[email]`, where `xxx_` is any prefix of your choice (these patterns are significant only in testmode):\n\n| Email Address | Effect |\n| --- | --- |\n| `xxx_chargeable@example.com` | The source will be created as `pending`, but automatically transition to `chargeable` within seconds of its creation. |\n\n[\n\n## Charge the Source![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n\n\n](#charge-request)\n\nOnce the customer has authenticated the payment, the source’s `status` transitions to `chargeable` and it can be used to make a charge request. This transition happens asynchronously and may occur after the customer was redirected back to your website.\n\nSome customers using giropay assume that the order process is complete once they have authenticated the payment and received confirmation from their bank. This results in customers who close their browser instead of following the redirect and returning to your app or website.\n\nFor these reasons it is essential that your integration rely on [webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks \"webhook\") to determine when the source becomes chargeable in order to create a charge. Please refer to our [best practices](https://docs.stripe.com/sources/best-practices) for more details on how to best integrate payment methods using webhooks.\n\n### Webhooks![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe following webhook events are sent to notify you about changes to the source’s status:\n\n| Event | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `source.chargeable` | A `Source` object becomes `chargeable` after a customer has authenticated and verified a payment. |\n| `source.failed` | A `Source` object failed to become chargeable as your customer declined to authenticate the payment. |\n| `source.canceled` | A `Source` object expired and cannot be used to create a charge. |\n\n### Make a charge request using the source![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nOnce the source is chargeable, from your `source.chargeable` webhook handler, you can make a charge request using the source ID as the value for the `source` parameter to complete the payment.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/charges \\   -u` \n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`: \\   -d amount=\"1099\" \\   -d currency=\"eur\" \\   -d source=src_18eYalAHEMiOZZp1l9ZTjSU0`\n\ngiropay Sources are [single-use](https://docs.stripe.com/sources#single-use-or-reusable) and cannot be used for recurring or additional payments. Refer to our [Sources & Customers](https://docs.stripe.com/sources/customers) guide for more information on how single-use Sources interact with [Customers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers \"Customers\").\n\n[\n\n## Confirm that the charge has succeeded![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n\n\n](#charge-confirmation)\n\nSince giropay is a [synchronous](https://docs.stripe.com/sources#synchronous-or-asynchronous-confirmation) payment method and the customer has already authenticated the payment as part of the redirect, unless there is an unexpected error, the [Charge](https://docs.stripe.com/api#charge_object) will immediately succeed.\n\nYou will also receive the following webhook event as the charge is created:\n\n| Event | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `charge.succeeded` | The charge succeeded and the payment is complete. |\n\nWe recommend that you rely on the `charge.succeeded` webhook event to notify your customer that the payment process has been completed and their order is confirmed. Please refer to our [best practices](https://docs.stripe.com/sources/best-practices) for more details on how to best integrate payment methods using webhooks.\n\n### Disputed payments![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe risk of fraud or unrecognized payments is much lower as the customer must authenticate the payment with their bank. As such, there is no dispute process that can result in a chargeback and funds withdrawn from your Stripe account. Should a customer dispute a payment to their bank, it is handled internally—no dispute information is presented in the Dashboard.\n\n### Refunds![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nPayments made with giropay can only be submitted for refund within 180 days from the date of the original charge. After 180 days, it is no longer possible to refund the charge.\n\n### Source expiration![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nA source must be used within six hours of becoming `chargeable`. If it is not, its status is automatically transitioned to `canceled` and your integration receives a `source.canceled` webhook event. Additionally, `pending` sources are canceled after one hour if they are not used to authenticate a payment.\n\nOnce a source is canceled, the customer’s authenticated payment is refunded automatically—no money is moved into your account. For this reason, make sure the order is canceled on your end and the customer is notified once you receive the `source.canceled` event.",

  "markdown": "# Email receipts and paid invoices\n\n## Send payment or refund receipts automatically.\n\nWith [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout \"Stripe Checkout\"), you can manually or automatically send customized email receipts or [paid invoices](#paid-invoices).\n\n## Receipt features ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nEach receipt contains a link to view it in a browser, and a unique [receipt number](https://docs.stripe.com/api#charge_object-receipt_number) that’s useful when looking up payment information.\n\nYou can also access the link to view the receipt in a browser through the API in the [PaymentIntent’s](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents \"Payment Intents API\") related [Charge](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/object#charge_object-receipt_url) object. When you visit the link, the receipt always shows the latest status of that charge–if it has been refunded, the receipt accurately reflects it.\n\nAs a security measure, receipt links expire within 30 days. Expired receipt links require the customer to provide the original email address to resend the receipt to that address.\n\n## Automatically send receipts ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nTo enable automated receipts, toggle **Successful payments** on in your [Customer emails settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/emails). Receipts are only sent when a successful payment has been made—no receipt is sent if the payment fails or is declined.\n\n## Manually send receipts ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nTo send receipts in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/payments), click **Send receipt** within the **Receipt history** section of a Payment details page. You can also hover over a payment within the **Payments** section of a customer’s page and click the **Send receipt** icon. To resend an email receipt, input a different email address, or specify a comma-separated list of addresses to send it to several recipients. A record of the last 10 receipts is visible on the payment’s page.\n\n## Customize receipts ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nAlter the appearance and functionality of your receipts with the following customization options:\n\n*   **Language**: Select the language for your receipts in your [Customer emails settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/emails).\n*   **Branding**: Modify the logo and colors in your [Branding settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/branding). The upper limit for a custom logo image file size is 512KB. Ideally, the logo should be a square image exceeding 128 x 128 pixels. JPG, PNG, and GIF file types are supported.\n*   **Public information**: Specify the public information you want to include, such as your contact number or website address, in your [Public details settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/public).\n\nTo display custom text, use the [description](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-description) attribute on the PaymentIntent. Some examples include:\n\n*   Description of goods or services provided.\n*   Authorization code.\n*   Subscription information.\n*   Cancellation policies.\n\nYou can see a real-time preview of your email receipt on your Dashboard Branding settings page. To send a test receipt, hover over the preview image and click **Send test receipt**, then enter your email address.\n\n#### Caution\n\nReceipts pull data from the `Charge` object generated when the PaymentIntent is confirmed. To update receipt data such as the `description` after the charge is generated, you must [update the Charge](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/update). Changes to a confirmed PaymentIntent don’t appear on receipts.\n\n## Refund receipts ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nWhen a payment is refunded, Stripe can automatically send a receipt to the same email address provided in the original charge. You can also use the Dashboard to manually send a copy of the refund receipt. To enable automated refund receipts, toggle **Refunds** on in your [Customer emails settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/emails).\n\n## Invoice and subscription payment receipts![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nStripe creates a receipt when a customer pays an [invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices \"invoices\") or makes any [subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/creating \"subscriptions\") payment. Receipts for subscription and invoice payments are itemized to include line items, discounts, and taxes. After payment, the [Hosted Invoice Page](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/hosted-invoice-page) includes a link to a receipt that the customer can download for their own records.\n\n## Stripe Connect receipts ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nReceipt settings depend on the charge and account type:\n\n*   [Destination charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges) and [separate charges and transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers): Receipts use the platform account’s **Customer emails**, **Branding**, and **Public details** settings.\n    \n*   [Direct charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges): Receipts use the connected account’s **Customer emails**, **Branding**, and **Public details** settings.\n    \n\nPlatform accounts can send a receipt for a connected account by passing `receipt_email` when making a charge request.\n\nFor connected accounts that use the Stripe Dashboard (which includes Standard connected accounts), you can configure receipt settings under [Branding](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/branding). For connected accounts that don’t use the Dashboard (which includes Express and Custom connected accounts), the platform configures receipt settings through [settings.branding](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/update#update_account-settings-branding).\n\n## Automatically send paid invoices ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nIn addition to ordinary receipts, Checkout can generate paid invoices as proof of payment. Invoices have more information than receipts. For subscriptions, Stripe generates invoices automatically, but for one-time payments, you need to enable them.\n\n#### Note\n\nInvoice creation for one-time payments in Checkout is not an [Invoicing](https://stripe.com/invoicing) feature, and is priced separately. Review [this support article](https://support.stripe.com/questions/pricing-for-post-payment-invoices-for-one-time-purchases-via-checkout-and-payment-links) to learn more.\n\nTo generate invoices, first, in your [Customer emails settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/emails), under **Email customers about**, select **Successful payments**. Then, when creating a Checkout session, set [invoice\\_creation\\[enabled\\]](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-invoice_creation-enabled) to `true`.\n\n#### Note\n\nEnabling `invoice_creation` isn’t supported if you set `payment_intent_data[capture_method]` to `manual`.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/checkout/sessions \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d mode=payment \\  -d \"invoice_creation[enabled]\"=true \\  -d \"line_items[0][price]\"={{ONE_TIME_PRICE_ID}} \\   -d \"line_items[0][quantity]\"=1 \\   --data-urlencode success_url=\"https://example.com\" \\   --data-urlencode cancel_url=\"https://example.com\"`\n\nAfter the payment completes, Stripe sends an invoice summary with links to download the invoice PDF and invoice receipt to the email address your customer provides during checkout.\n\n#### Caution\n\nInvoices for delayed notification payment methods such as [Bacs Direct Debit](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/bacs-debit/accept-a-payment), [Bank transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/bank-transfers/accept-a-payment), [Boleto](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/boleto/accept-a-payment), [Canadian pre-authorized debits](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/acss-debit/accept-a-payment), [Konbini](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/konbini/accept-a-payment), [OXXO](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/oxxo/accept-a-payment), [Pay by Bank](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/pay-by-bank/accept-a-payment), [SEPA Direct Debit](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/sepa-debit/accept-a-payment), [SOFORT](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/sofort/accept-a-payment), or [ACH Direct Debit](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/ach-debit/accept-a-payment) might take longer to send because we send the invoice after successful payment, not upon checkout session completion.\n\n![Screenshot of the invoice PDF that customers can download from the invoice summary email](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/invoice.9e44668032383601eeec362f38293b7a.png)\n\nThe downloadable invoice PDF\n\n![Screenshot of the invoice receipt that customers can download from the invoice summary email](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/invoice_receipt.4f120ee7363f8e7728fa553a8a24aae3.png)\n\nThe downloadable invoice receipt\n\n![Screenshot of the invoice summary email Stripe sends](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/email.560c2666905531b907f7fcd4f1a0a6dd.png)\n\nThe customer email with links to the invoice PDF and receipt\n\nYou can also view the invoice in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/invoices) or access it programmatically by listening to the [`invoice.paid`](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-invoice.paid) webhook event.\n\nYou can use the `invoice_data` hash inside `invoice_creation` to further customize the invoice generated by the Checkout Session.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/checkout/sessions \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d mode=payment \\  -d \"invoice_creation[enabled]\"=true \\  -d \"invoice_creation[invoice_data][description]\"=\"Invoice for Product X\" \\  -d \"invoice_creation[invoice_data][metadata][order]\"=order-xyz \\  -d \"invoice_creation[invoice_data][account_tax_ids][0]\"=DE123456789 \\  -d \"invoice_creation[invoice_data][custom_fields][0][name]\"=\"Purchase Order\" \\  -d \"invoice_creation[invoice_data][custom_fields][0][value]\"=PO-XYZ \\  -d \"invoice_creation[invoice_data][rendering_options][amount_tax_display]\"=include_inclusive_tax \\  -d \"invoice_creation[invoice_data][footer]\"=\"B2B Inc.\" \\  -d \"line_items[0][price]\"={{ONE_TIME_PRICE_ID}} \\   -d \"line_items[0][quantity]\"=1 \\   --data-urlencode success_url=\"https://example.com\" \\   --data-urlencode cancel_url=\"https://example.com\"`\n\nReview [invoice best practices](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/global-invoicing) for your region to make sure you’re collecting the right information from your customers.

Charge your customer for shipping using different Stripe products, some of which require coding. Before you create a shipping rate, learn how to [collect billing and shipping addresses](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/collect-addresses).\n\n#### Third-party plugins\n\nIf you’re using a third-party application with Stripe (for example, [Thrivecart](https://support.thrivecart.com/help/setting-your-physical-fulfilment-shipping-options/) or [Shopify](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/shipping/setting-up-and-managing-your-shipping/setting-up-shipping-rates)) and want to adjust the shipping rate, visit the docs for that service.\n\nTo add a [shipping rate](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/shipping-rates) using the Dashboard:\n\n1.

  "markdown": "# Tax overrides | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Tax overridesBeta\n\n## Learn how to override tax behavior using Stripe Tax.\n\nSet up Stripe Tax to fit your business needs with tax overrides. Create rules that apply to a product tax code in any supported location.\n\nFor example, you can:\n\n*   Change the [Software as a service (SaaS) - personal use](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-codes?tax_code=txcd_10103000) tax code from taxable to non-taxable in Louisiana to reflect the uncertainty of how SaaS might be taxed.\n*   Apply a 5% tax rate to the [Newspapers](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-codes?tax_code=txcd_35020100%09) tax code in Poland, instead of the applied rate of 8%, to reflect that your product is a regional newspaper and not a national one.\n*   Treat the [Food for non-immediate consumption](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-codes?tax_code=txcd_40040000) tax code as taxable at the standard rate in New York, to reflect that you sell a bagels with cream cheese.\n\nAfter you create a tax override, you’re responsible for keeping the rate and taxability up to date with any changes in tax law. When you remove a tax override, Stripe manages the updates.\n\n## Create a tax override![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nTo create a tax override rule, you must enable tax collection in Stripe by [adding a tax registration](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/registering?#add-a-registration) for a jurisdiction. We recommend that you create your first tax override in a sandbox to make sure that you get the tax outcome you expect:\n\n1.  In the Dashboard, navigate to the [Overrides tab](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/overrides) in the Tax page.\n2.  Click **\\+ Create override**.\n3.  In the section **Product tax code**, choose the product tax code your override applies to.\n4.  _(Optional)_ Specify the date and time for the override rule to become effective under **Effective date**. For example, you can set the override rule to start from the first day of the month. If you don’t set a date, the rule takes effect immediately.\n5.  In the section **Rule location**, choose a jurisdiction where your override applies.\n    *   You can create a rule that applies to a country or state.\n    *   For US jurisdictions, you can also create a rule that only applies to a specific city, county, or district.\n6.  For **Tax type**, choose the type of tax your override applies to.\n7.  Click the Tax behavior you want to apply. We indicate whether the product tax code you chose is taxable or non-taxable in that specific location and for the particular tax type (for example, sales tax or VAT).\n    *   If you choose **Taxable**, you have two options:\n        \n        *   Apply the standard rate. This means that your rule always uses the standard rate that Stripe has determined for that product tax code, tax, and location. If the standard rate changes, that change also applies to your products.\n        *   Apply a custom rate. This means that your rule uses the tax rate that you set. If the standard rate changes for that product, your custom rate still applies.\n        \n        You can’t apply a custom rate in the US when creating a rule for a state that applies to all jurisdictions in a state because several cities and counties have different tax rates. To determine a custom rate for these jurisdictions, select a specific city, county, or district in the jurisdiction dropdown.\n        \n8.  Verify that all of the details in the **Summary** panel are correct. The **Rate preview** displays the expected tax rate that applies for a location within the jurisdiction you chose.\n    *   The calculated tax might vary for other addresses within the same jurisdiction.\n    *   In some cases, the tax code, tax, and location you select might be taxed at the location of your business, rather than the destination of the customer. In these cases, the preview displays how tax applies in your business location. We don’t use your tax override rule in these cases.\n9.  Click **Create rule** to apply your rule immediately, or at the time and date you chose.\n\n## View and maintain your tax overrides![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nView all your override rules in the [Overrides tab](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/overrides). Click an override to view the following information:\n\n*   When the rule was created or edited.\n*   Who created or edited the rule.\n*   The taxability and rate that’s applied.\n*   The tax code, location, and tax the rule applies to.\n\nIf you have an override in place, Stripe won’t automatically update the taxability or custom rate of your product if something changes. It’s your responsibility to maintain your tax overrides to make sure they reflect what’s needed for your business.\n\n## Edit a tax override![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nIf your override is scheduled to start in the future, you can edit the start or end time of your override rule. If your rule is already active, you can edit the end date and time. To change the tax code, location, or tax rate, you must archive the rule and create a new one in its place.\n\nTo edit your tax rule:\n\n1.  In the Dashboard, navigate to the [Overrides tab](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/overrides) in the Tax page.\n2.  Find the override rule you want to edit.\n3.  Click the overflow menu () next to the rule and choose **Edit rule**.\n4.  Make your changes to the time and date.\n5.  Click **Save**.\n\n## Archive a tax override![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYou can archive an override that you created. After you archive an override rule, it no longer applies to your tax transactions and Stripe’s default behavior applies instead. Rules can’t be unarchived, but you can create a new rule instead.\n\nTo archive your tax override:\n\n1.  In the Dashboard, navigate to the [Overrides tab](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/overrides) in the Tax page.\n2.  Find the tax override you want to archive.\n3.  Click the overflow menu () next to the rule and choose **Archive rule**.\n4.  Confirm your changes, then click **Archive**.\n\n## Verify which transactions have a tax override rule applied![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nTo verify which tax override applies to a transaction, view the **customizations\\_applied\\_ids** column of the [itemized export](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/reports?#itemized-exports).\n\nWe don’t include transactions that contain tax overrides in the US-specific location reports or summarized reports. Learn more about the [different tax reports](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/reports).\n\n## How we pick which override applies![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nWhen two rules apply to the same product in the same jurisdiction, Stripe only applies the more specific rule.\n\nFor example, this might apply if Stripe treats your product as taxable in the state of Colorado, but you want to treat it as non-taxable in all of Colorado except for the city of Boulder, where it should be taxed at the standard rate.\n\nTo change this, you can create a rule for the tax code that you apply to your product for the state of Colorado:\n\n1.  Navigate to the [Overrides tab](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/overrides) in the Tax page, then choose **Colorado** from the **Rule location** dropdown.\n2.  Enable **Include all jurisdictions**.\n3.  Choose **Sales Tax** from the **Tax type** dropdown.\n4.  Set **Non-taxable** as the **Tax behavior**.\n\nAdditionally, you can create a second rule for the same tax code to apply tax in Boulder, but not elsewhere in Colorado:\n\n1.  Navigate to the [Overrides tab](https://dashboard.stripe.com/tax/overrides) in the Tax page, then choose **Colorado** from the **Choose location** dropdown under **Rule location**.\n2.  Disable **Include all jurisdictions**.\n3.  Choose **Boulder** from the _Choose a jurisdiction_\\* dropdown.\n4.  Choose **Sales Tax** from the **Tax type** dropdown.\n5.  Set **Standard rate** as the **Tax behavior**.\n\nYou can’t create a tax override that applies to the same specific jurisdiction (for example, Boulder) for the same tax code, during the same time period.\n\n## When you can’t use overrides![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nSome parts of a tax calculation can’t be overridden. The following things will continue to affect the final tax calculation:\n\n*   **Sourcing rules**: These rules determine whether tax is calculated using the destination of the buyer or the origin of the seller. If you create an override that applies to a jurisdiction, but your product is sourced to the origin instead, your override rule won’t apply.\n*   Tiers, thresholds, and taxable basis apply in some jurisdictions:\n    *   **Taxable basis**: In certain locations, only a specific portion of the tax code is taxable. For example, in Texas, only 80% of the cost of Software as a service is subject to tax.\n    *   **Treatment based on price**: Products might be treated differently based on their price. For example, in New York, clothing is exempt from tax if it costs under 110 USD, but taxable if it exceeds that amount. Even if you create a rule for New York City with a custom rate, sales of clothing in New York under 110 USD is still considered exempt.\n\nTax overrides in Stripe don’t transfer to TaxJar. When using TaxJar for filing, these overrides aren’t taken into account when TaxJar recalculates the tax you’re expected to file. As a result, tax overrides might not be suitable for your specific use case.",

  "markdown": "# Card verification checks | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Learn how to make use of card verification checks to protect against disputes and fraud.\n\nWhen a card payment is submitted to a card network for authorization, Stripe provides the CVC, postal code, and billing street address for them to verify (if you collected these from the customer in your checkout flow). The card issuer checks this against the information they have on file for the cardholder. If the provided information doesn’t match, the verification check fails. A failed CVC or postal code check can indicate the payment is fraudulent, so review it carefully before fulfilling the order.\n\nEach [Charge](https://docs.stripe.com/api#charge_object) object includes the [verification response](https://docs.stripe.com/api#create_charge-verification-responses) as part of its `source` attribute. You can also find the verification results in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/payments) when viewing a payment.\n\nIf no information is collected, the card issuer can’t perform a verification check. Collect the CVC, postal code, and billing address for every payment to avoid this issue. The results of verification checks help improve the detection of fraudulent activity.\n\n## Card verification code check (CVC) ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nThe CVC (also referred to as CVV) is the three- or four-digit number printed directly on a card, usually on the signature strip or the front of the card. [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar \"Radar\") includes a [rule](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/rules#built-in-rules) to block any payments that fail the CVC verification check, which you can enable or disable within the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/radar/rules).\n\nThis doesn’t affect payments where the CVC check couldn’t be performed or is unavailable, for example [Wallets](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods \"digital wallet\") like Apple Pay or off-session payments.\n\nYou can perform CVC verification by providing the CVC value either when you create a payment with a new card payment method, or when you attach a new card payment method to a customer.\n\nIn general, only cardholders in physical possession of the card should have access to the CVC number. Businesses are not permitted to store the CVC number, so it’s unlikely that a fraudster can obtain this information through a computer breach. However, CVC verification doesn’t protect against the physical theft of a card, nor card information being used on a computer or website that isn’t secure.\n\n## Address verification (AVS) ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nAddress verification (AVS) checks two pieces of information, the postal code and the billing street address. AVS checks determine whether this information matches the billing address on file with the card issuer. Radar includes a [rule](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/rules#built-in-rules) to block any payments that fail postal code verification, which you can enable or disable within the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/).\n\nIf enabled, these address checks can fail on legitimate payments in some situations. For example, a customer entering their address incorrectly or moving and not updating their address with the card issuer could cause the address check to fail.\n\nSupport for both types of AVS checks varies by country and card issuer (for example, certain countries don’t use a postal code or some card issuers don’t support street address verification). However, street address verification is commonly supported for cards issued in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom.",

  "markdown": "# Virtual bank account numbers | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Learn best practices for using Virtual Bank Account Numbers (VBANs) for reconciliation on Stripe.\n\nVirtual Bank Account Numbers (VBANs) are an important part of the bank transfers payment method. To accept funds from a bank transfer, Stripe issues a VBAN to your customer. When the customer transfers money to that VBAN, Stripe automatically allocates the funds to the customer’s cash balance. After these funds arrive on the customer’s cash balance, Stripe carries out further reconciliation steps to associate the funds with the correct PaymentIntent or Invoice.\n\nAfter a customer has been allocated a VBAN, it belongs to them forever. Any additional funds that are sent to that VBAN are automatically added to customer’s cash balance. Because VBANs are permanent, it’s important to understand their limits and best practices for using them.\n\n## Allocation![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThere are several ways to allocate a VBAN to a customer.\n\n*   When you create and confirm a **PaymentIntent** with the customer balance payment method, Stripe looks for an existing VBAN that is assigned to the customer and for the country specified in the request. If the customer does not have an appropriate VBAN, Stripe generates a new VBAN for the customer.\n    \n*   When you create a new **Invoice** with the customer balance payment method, Stripe looks for an existing VBAN that matches the country and is assigned to the customer specified in the request. If the customer does not have an appropriate VBAN, Stripe generates a new VBAN for the customer.\n    \n*   The [Funding Instructions API](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/customer-balance/funding-instructions) creates VBANs without requiring an existing PaymentIntent or Invoice. You can use this API when you don’t expect payment from a customer yet but still want to create a new VBAN for them.\n    \n\n## Limits and Best Practices![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nWhen you integrate with bank transfers, only request a VBAN for a customer if they’re likely to make a payment using a bank transfer. In these cases, you only generate a VBAN when creating a PaymentIntent or a Invoice.\n\nDon’t assign VBANs to inactive customers or make VBAN allocation part of your registration flow.\n\nDue to regional differences in VBAN availability, Stripe enforces different limits per region. If you need more VBANs than the limits allow, please [reach out to our support team](https://support.stripe.com/).\n\n| Region | Limits |\n| --- | --- |\n| US  | We allow up to **5,000** new VBANs every 24 hours. |\n| UK  | We allow up to **2,000** new VBANs every 24 hours. |\n| EU  | We allow up to **5,000** new VBANs every 24 hours and enforce a lifetime limit of **50,000** VBANs per account. Stripe also charges [a fee](https://stripe.com/pricing/local-payment-methods) for every new VBAN allocation over 1,000 allocations made in the EU. |\n| JP  | We allow up to **1,000** new VBANs every 24 hours. |\n| MX  | We allow up to **1,000** new VBANs every 24 hours. |",

All major Dutch banks are members of Currence, the scheme that operates iDEAL, making it the most popular online payment method in the Netherlands with a share of online transactions close to 55%.\n\niDEAL redirects customers to their online banking environment to authenticate a payment using a [second factor of authentication](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#customer-actions) and there is [immediate notification](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#payment-notification) about the success or failure of a payment.

If you use our front-end products, Stripe automatically determines the most relevant payment methods to display. Go to the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) and enable iDEAL. To get started with one of our hosted UIs, follow a quickstart:\n\n*   [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/quickstart): Our prebuilt, hosted checkout page.\n*   [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/quickstart): Our drop-in UI components.\n\n### Other payment products![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe following Stripe products also let you add iDEAL from the Dashboard:\n\n*   [Invoicing](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/quickstart-guide)\n*   [Payment Links](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links)\n\nIf you prefer to manually list payment methods or want to save iDEAL details for future payments, see the following guides:\n\n*   [Manually configure iDEAL as a payment method](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/ideal/accept-a-payment)\n*   [Save iDEAL details for future payments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/ideal/set-up-payment)\n\nCheck out the iDEAL [sample on GitHub](https://github.com/stripe-samples/accept-a-payment).\n\n## Disputed payments![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe risk of fraud or unrecognized payments is low because the customer must authenticate the payment with their bank. As a result, you won’t have disputes that turn into chargebacks, with funds withdrawn from your Stripe account.\n\n## Refunds![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\niDEAL payments can be refunded up to 180 days after the original payment.",

The collection of verification checks performed is determined from the `type` and `options` parameters used. You can find the result of each verification check performed in the appropriate sub-resource: `document`, `id_number`, `selfie`.\n\nEach VerificationReport contains a copy of any data collected by the user as well as reference IDs which can be used to access collected images through the [FileUpload](https://docs.stripe.com/api/files) API. To configure and create VerificationReports, use the [VerificationSession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_sessions) API.\n\nRelated guide: [Accessing verification results](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verification-sessions#results).\n\n## [Crypto Onramp Quotes](https://docs.stripe.com/api/crypto/onramp_quotes)\n\nCrypto Onramp Quotes are estimated quotes for onramp conversions into all the different cryptocurrencies on different networks. The Quotes API allows you to display quotes in your product UI before directing the user to the onramp widget.\n\nRelated guide: [Quotes API](https://docs.stripe.com/crypto/quotes-api)\n\n## [Climate Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/climate/product)\n\nA Climate product represents a type of carbon removal unit available for reservation. You can retrieve it to see the current price and availability.\n\n## [Forwarding Request](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/request)\n\nInstructs Stripe to make a request on your behalf using the destination URL. The destination URL is activated by Stripe at the time of onboarding. Stripe verifies requests with your credentials provided during onboarding, and injects card details from the payment\\_method into the request.\n\nStripe redacts all sensitive fields and headers, including authentication credentials and card numbers, before storing the request and response data in the forwarding Request object, which are subject to a 30-day retention period.\n\nYou can provide a Stripe idempotency key to make sure that requests with the same key result in only one outbound request. The Stripe idempotency key provided should be unique and different from any idempotency keys provided on the underlying third-party request.\n\nForwarding Requests are synchronous requests that return a response or time out according to Stripe’s limits.\n\nRelated guide: [Forward card details to third-party API endpoints](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/forwarding).\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/create)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/retrieve)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/list)",

The collection of verification checks performed is determined from the `type` and `options` parameters used. You can find the result of each verification check performed in the appropriate sub-resource: `document`, `id_number`, `selfie`.\n\nEach VerificationReport contains a copy of any data collected by the user as well as reference IDs which can be used to access collected images through the [FileUpload](https://docs.stripe.com/api/files) API. To configure and create VerificationReports, use the [VerificationSession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_sessions) API.\n\nRelated guide: [Accessing verification results](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verification-sessions#results).\n\n## [Crypto Onramp Quotes](https://docs.stripe.com/api/crypto/onramp_quotes)\n\nCrypto Onramp Quotes are estimated quotes for onramp conversions into all the different cryptocurrencies on different networks. The Quotes API allows you to display quotes in your product UI before directing the user to the onramp widget.\n\nRelated guide: [Quotes API](https://docs.stripe.com/crypto/quotes-api)\n\n## [Climate Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/climate/product)\n\nA Climate product represents a type of carbon removal unit available for reservation. You can retrieve it to see the current price and availability.\n\n## [Forwarding Request](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/request)\n\nInstructs Stripe to make a request on your behalf using the destination URL. The destination URL is activated by Stripe at the time of onboarding. Stripe verifies requests with your credentials provided during onboarding, and injects card details from the payment\\_method into the request.\n\nStripe redacts all sensitive fields and headers, including authentication credentials and card numbers, before storing the request and response data in the forwarding Request object, which are subject to a 30-day retention period.\n\nYou can provide a Stripe idempotency key to make sure that requests with the same key result in only one outbound request. The Stripe idempotency key provided should be unique and different from any idempotency keys provided on the underlying third-party request.\n\nForwarding Requests are synchronous requests that return a response or time out according to Stripe’s limits.\n\nRelated guide: [Forward card details to third-party API endpoints](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/forwarding).\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/create)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/retrieve)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/list)",

The collection of verification checks performed is determined from the `type` and `options` parameters used. You can find the result of each verification check performed in the appropriate sub-resource: `document`, `id_number`, `selfie`.\n\nEach VerificationReport contains a copy of any data collected by the user as well as reference IDs which can be used to access collected images through the [FileUpload](https://docs.stripe.com/api/files) API. To configure and create VerificationReports, use the [VerificationSession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_sessions) API.\n\nRelated guide: [Accessing verification results](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verification-sessions#results).\n\n## [Crypto Onramp Quotes](https://docs.stripe.com/api/crypto/onramp_quotes)\n\nCrypto Onramp Quotes are estimated quotes for onramp conversions into all the different cryptocurrencies on different networks. The Quotes API allows you to display quotes in your product UI before directing the user to the onramp widget.\n\nRelated guide: [Quotes API](https://docs.stripe.com/crypto/quotes-api)\n\n## [Climate Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/climate/product)\n\nA Climate product represents a type of carbon removal unit available for reservation. You can retrieve it to see the current price and availability.\n\n## [Forwarding Request](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/request)\n\nInstructs Stripe to make a request on your behalf using the destination URL. The destination URL is activated by Stripe at the time of onboarding. Stripe verifies requests with your credentials provided during onboarding, and injects card details from the payment\\_method into the request.\n\nStripe redacts all sensitive fields and headers, including authentication credentials and card numbers, before storing the request and response data in the forwarding Request object, which are subject to a 30-day retention period.\n\nYou can provide a Stripe idempotency key to make sure that requests with the same key result in only one outbound request. The Stripe idempotency key provided should be unique and different from any idempotency keys provided on the underlying third-party request.\n\nForwarding Requests are synchronous requests that return a response or time out according to Stripe’s limits.\n\nRelated guide: [Forward card details to third-party API endpoints](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/forwarding).\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/create)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/retrieve)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/list)",

The collection of verification checks performed is determined from the `type` and `options` parameters used. You can find the result of each verification check performed in the appropriate sub-resource: `document`, `id_number`, `selfie`.\n\nEach VerificationReport contains a copy of any data collected by the user as well as reference IDs which can be used to access collected images through the [FileUpload](https://docs.stripe.com/api/files) API. To configure and create VerificationReports, use the [VerificationSession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_sessions) API.\n\nRelated guide: [Accessing verification results](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verification-sessions#results).\n\n## [Crypto Onramp Quotes](https://docs.stripe.com/api/crypto/onramp_quotes)\n\nCrypto Onramp Quotes are estimated quotes for onramp conversions into all the different cryptocurrencies on different networks. The Quotes API allows you to display quotes in your product UI before directing the user to the onramp widget.\n\nRelated guide: [Quotes API](https://docs.stripe.com/crypto/quotes-api)\n\n## [Climate Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/climate/product)\n\nA Climate product represents a type of carbon removal unit available for reservation. You can retrieve it to see the current price and availability.\n\n## [Forwarding Request](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/request)\n\nInstructs Stripe to make a request on your behalf using the destination URL. The destination URL is activated by Stripe at the time of onboarding. Stripe verifies requests with your credentials provided during onboarding, and injects card details from the payment\\_method into the request.\n\nStripe redacts all sensitive fields and headers, including authentication credentials and card numbers, before storing the request and response data in the forwarding Request object, which are subject to a 30-day retention period.\n\nYou can provide a Stripe idempotency key to make sure that requests with the same key result in only one outbound request. The Stripe idempotency key provided should be unique and different from any idempotency keys provided on the underlying third-party request.\n\nForwarding Requests are synchronous requests that return a response or time out according to Stripe’s limits.\n\nRelated guide: [Forward card details to third-party API endpoints](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/forwarding).\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/create)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/retrieve)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/list)",

If you use our front-end products, Stripe automatically determines the most relevant payment methods to display. Go to the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) and enable OXXO. To get started with one of our hosted UIs, follow a quickstart:\n\n*   [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/quickstart): Our prebuilt, hosted checkout page.\n*   [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/quickstart): Our drop-in UI components.\n\n[Payment Links](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links) also supports adding OXXO from the Dashboard.\n\nIf your integration requires manually listing payment methods, learn how to [manually configure OXXO as a payment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/oxxo/accept-a-payment).\n\nCheck out the OXXO [sample on GitHub](https://github.com/stripe-samples/accept-a-payment).\n\n## Disputed payments ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nOXXO payments have a low risk of fraud or unrecognized payments because the customer must provide cash payment in person at an OXXO convenience store.

Some merchants have created a separate process to credit their customers who reach out directly.\n\n## Amount limits ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nThe amount for a single OXXO must be at least 10.00 MXN and no more than 10,000.00 MXN.",

  "markdown": "# Using Connect with Custom connected accounts\n\n## Use Custom connected accounts with Connect to control your connected accounts' entire experience.\n\n#### Note\n\nIdentity verification requirements are updated as laws and regulations change around the world. If you’re building your own onboarding flow to onboard accounts, you must plan on reviewing and updating onboarding requirements at least every six months. To avoid this maintenance obligation, use [Connect Onboarding for Custom Accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom/hosted-onboarding).\n\nA _Custom_ connected account is almost completely invisible to the account holder. You, the platform, are responsible for all interactions with your connected accounts and for collecting all the information needed to verify each account.\n\nWith Custom connected accounts, you can modify the connected account’s details and settings through the API, including managing their bank accounts and [payout](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts \"payout\") schedule. Since Custom connected account holders can’t log into Stripe, it’s up to you to build the onboarding flow, connected account dashboard, reporting functionality, and communication channels.\n\nCreating a Custom connected account involves the following steps:\n\n1.  Make sure you meet the [minimum requirements](#requirements).\n2.  Properly identify the [country](#country) and any related requirements.\n3.  [Create](#create) the account.\n4.  Complete the [identity verification](#identity-verification) process.\n\n#### Note\n\nTo comply with French PSD2 regulations, platforms in France [must use account tokens](https://stripe.com/guides/frequently-asked-questions-about-stripe-connect-and-psd2#regulatory-status-of-connect). An additional benefit of tokens is that the platform doesn’t have to store PII data, which is transferred from the connected account directly to Stripe. For platforms in other countries, we recommend using account tokens, but they aren’t required.\n\n## Requirements for creating Custom connected accounts ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nTo use Custom connected accounts, you must meet all of these requirements:\n\n*   **Minimum API version**: You must be using an API version at least as recent as 2014-12-17. You can [view and upgrade](https://dashboard.stripe.com/developers) your API version in the Dashboard if needed.\n*   **Terms of Service update**: Creating Custom connected accounts requires an [update to your terms of service](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/updating-service-agreements#tos-acceptance), as it must include a reference to Stripe’s services agreement. Stripe recommends that you consult with your attorneys on whether you should update your terms acceptance language to include reference to Stripe’s terms.\n*   **Handling information requests**: Instead of requesting information—such as a Social Security Number or passport scan—directly from your connected account user, Stripe requests the information it needs from you. You must collect that information from your connected account and provide it to Stripe. Otherwise, Stripe might disable payouts to the connected account.\n*   **Platform in a supported country**: Platforms in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Hungary, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, the United Kingdom, and the United States can create Custom accounts for any country [Stripe supports](https://stripe.com/global). [Contact us](mailto:connect@stripe.com) to be notified when platforms in your country can use Custom connected accounts.\n*   **Countries that don’t support self-serve**: Due to restrictions that apply when using Connect in the [United Arab Emirates](https://support.stripe.com/questions/connect-availability-in-the-uae), [India](https://support.stripe.com/questions/stripe-india-support-for-marketplaces), and [Thailand](https://support.stripe.com/questions/stripe-thailand-support-for-marketplace), platform users in these countries can’t self-serve Custom connected accounts. To begin onboarding for Custom connected accounts in these countries, [contact us](https://stripe.com/contact/sales).\n*   **Platforms in the UAE**: Platforms in the UAE can only use Custom connected accounts based in the UAE with the following charge types: [destination\\_charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges) and [separate charges and transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers). Destination charges using the [on\\_behalf\\_of](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-on_behalf_of) attribute are not yet supported for UAE platforms.\n\n#### Caution\n\nPlatforms outside of Mexico that want to create Custom connected accounts in Mexico and make them [settlement merchants](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-capabilities#card-payments) require further review. [Contact us](https://support.stripe.com/contact) to start the process.\n\n*   **Vetting for fraud**: Because your platform is responsible for losses incurred by Custom connected accounts, you must scrutinize all accounts that sign up via your platform for potential fraud. Refer to our [risk management best practices guide](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/risk-management/best-practices) for more information.\n\nNote there’s an [additional cost](https://stripe.com/connect/pricing) for active Custom connected accounts. A Custom connected account is considered active if it has received at least one successful payout in a given month.\n\n[](#country)\n\nThe only piece of information you need to create a Custom connected account is the country where the individual or business primarily operates. You can collect everything else at a later time.\n\nFor example, if you’re in the United States and the business or individual you’re creating a connected account for is legally represented in Canada, assign `CA` as the country.\n\nThe country value also determines the [required verification information](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information) for the connected account.\n\n[](#create)\n\nThe basic process to create and connect a Custom connected account is to call the account creation endpoint, setting `type` to `custom` and providing a country and the [appropriate capabilities](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-capabilities#supported-capabilities).\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/accounts \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d country=US \\  -d type=custom \\  -d \"capabilities[card_payments][requested]\"=true \\  -d \"capabilities[transfers][requested]\"=true`\n\n#### Caution\n\nThe result of a successful API call is the connected account information:\n\n`{   ...   \"id\":` \n\n`\"{{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}\"`\n\n`,   \"type\": \"custom\"   ... }`\n\nStore the `id` in your database—it’s the account ID. You’ll provide this value to [authenticate](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/authentication) as the connected account by passing it into requests in the `Stripe-Account` header.\n\n#### Note\n\nStore the received account ID. You need this information to perform requests on the connected account’s behalf.\n\n[](#identity-verification)\n\nAn account created with only a country is fairly limited: it can only receive a small amount of funds. If you wish to enable payouts and keep the account in good standing, you need to [provide more information](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/identity-verification) about the account holder. The [required verification information](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information) page lists the minimum and likely identity verification requirements.\n\nThe easiest way to collect this information is to integrate [Connect Onboarding](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom/hosted-onboarding), which lets Stripe take care of the verification complexity. Otherwise, you must not only write your own API calls for initial integration, but also continue to check for changing onboarding requirements because of changing regulations around the world.\n\nYou can collect required information when you [create the account](https://docs.stripe.com/api#create_account) or by [updating the account](https://docs.stripe.com/api#update_account) later. At the very least, we recommend collecting and providing the connected account user’s name and date of birth up front. If you collect [address information](https://support.stripe.com/questions/connect-address-validation) upfront, make sure to validate the state value for US, CA, and AU connected accounts in your onboarding flow.\n\n#### Note\n\nFor accounts with [business\\_type](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-business_type) set to `individual`, provide at least one `individual` property (for example, `individual.first_name`) and a [Person](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/object) object is created automatically. If you don’t, or for accounts with the `business_type` set to `company`, you need to [create each Person](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/create) for the account.\n\n## Webhooks![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nAfter an account is created, all notifications about changes to the account are sent to your [webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/webhooks) as `account.updated` events. Provide your [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect \"Connect\") [webhook](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks \"webhook\") URL in your [account settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/webhooks) and then watch for these events and respond to them as needed.",

The `ChipList` component handles the appropriate spacing and wrapping of chips in a list, and also provides for convenient keyboard navigation of chips using the right and left arrow keys.\n\n`<ChipList>   <Chip     label=\"Currency\"     value=\"USD\"     onDropdown={() => {       alert('Dropdown function triggered');     }}     onClose={() => {       alert('Close function triggered');     }}   />   <Chip     label=\"Status\"     value=\"Succeeded\"     onDropdown={() => {       alert('Dropdown function triggered');     }}     onClose={() => {       alert('Close function triggered');     }}   />   <Chip     value=\"jenny.rosen@stripe.com\"     onClose={() => {       alert('Closed jenny.rosen');     }}   />   <Chip     value=\"usr_0As2kXSWDS1lTZsH5agB\"     onClose={() => {       alert('Closed usr_0As2kXSWDS1lTZsH5agB');     }}   />   <Chip     label=\"Amount\"     onAddSuggestion={() => {       alert('Add Amount suggestion');     }}   />   <Chip     label=\"Date\"     onAddSuggestion={() => {       alert('Add Date suggestion');     }}   /> </ChipList>`\n\n## Non-closeable chip![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nWhen a `Chip` represents a required value, it can be useful to present a chip without an `add` or `cancel` icon.

You can also create a compound unit with `-per-` in between, such as `{unit: 'megabyte-per-hour'}`. |\n\n`<BarChart   data={[     {       date: 'January',       sold: 10,     },     {       date: 'February',       sold: 41,     },     {       date: 'March',       sold: 22,     },     {       date: 'April',       sold: 38,     },   ]}   x=\"date\"   y={{value: 'sold', label: 'Price', format: {currency: 'USD'}}} />`\n\n## Domain![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nTo set the minimum and maximum values of an axis, use the `domain` prop. For example, if you always want the `y` axis to go from 0 to 10 (rather than automatically adjusting to the data provided), add the `domain` property to your configuration:\n\n`const sales = [   {     date: 'Jan',     sold: 1,   },   {     date: 'Feb',     sold: 4,   },   {     date: 'Mar',     sold: 2,   },   {     date: 'Apr',     sold: 3,   }, ];  <BarChart   data={sales}   x=\"date\"   y={{value: 'sold', label: 'Sold', domain: [0, 10]}} />`",

  "markdown": "# UI testing | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Test your Stripe app UI with a set of utilities and helpers.\n\nThe Extension SDK includes a set of tools to write unit tests for your app’s user interface. We recommend running tests with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and we include [Jest custom matchers](#matchers) to help with writing assertions.\n\n## Conceptual overview![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nWhen testing your Stripe app’s UI, you’re testing a remote engine that renders your app, not the Document Object Model (DOM) tree directly.\n\nFor security purposes, the React code in your Stripe app repository is serialized, sent through an extension loader using an iframe, and translated into a DOM tree within the Stripe Dashboard. The testing tools provided by the Extension SDK work with the remote rendering engine.\n\n## Example![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThis example tests a [Button](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/components/button) UI component that changes text when clicked. In the test, we render the button, confirm that the initial button text is correct, click the button, and confirm that the text of the button has changed.\n\n`// App.tsx import {useState} from 'react'; import {ContextView, Button} from '@stripe/ui-extension-sdk/ui';  const App = () => {   const [isPressed, setIsPressed] = useState(false);   return (     <ContextView title=\"Hello world\">       <Button onPress={() => setIsPressed(true)}>         {isPressed ? 'You pressed me!' : 'Press me'}       </Button>     </ContextView>   ); };  export default App;  // App.test.tsx import {render} from '@stripe/ui-extension-sdk/testing'; import {Button} from '@stripe/ui-extension-sdk/ui'; import App from './App';  describe('App', () => {   it('changes button text when pressed', async () => {     const {wrapper, update} = render(<App />);      // Expect that the initial text is correct     expect(wrapper.find(Button)).toContainText('Press me');      // Press the button     wrapper.find(Button)!.trigger('onPress');      // This is needed if the \"onPress\" handler involves something asyncronous     // like a promise or a React useEffect hook     await update();      // Expect that the text changed     expect(wrapper.find(Button)).toContainText('You pressed me!');   }); });`\n\n## Rendering a component![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n### `render(element: React.ReactElement)`\n\nThe `render` method accepts a React element and returns an object with the following properties:\n\n*   `wrapper`: The root element of the component passed to `render`.\n*   `update`: A function that returns a promise that resolves after the JavaScript event stack has been cleared. This is useful when mocking APIs, dealing with promises, employing React hooks such as `useEffect`, or ensuring asynchronous rendering completes before running subsequent test cases.\n\n`import {render} from '@stripe/ui-extension-sdk/testing'; import App from './App';  it('contains a Button', async () => {   const {wrapper, update} = render(<App />);    await update();    // Continue testing... });`\n\n## Element properties and methods![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nWhen working with the wrapper or any element within it, use the following properties and methods to assess state and interact with your app:\n\n### `children: Element<unknown>[]`\n\nReturns an array of the direct children of the element.\n\n### `descendants: Element<unknown>[]`\n\nReturns an array of all elements below the element in the tree.\n\n### `debug(options?: {all?: boolean, depth?: number, verbosity?: number}): string`\n\nReturns a text representation of the element. You can modify `debug()` output using the `options` parameter.\n\n*   `all` overrides the default props filtering behavior and instead includes all props in the output. `debug()` omits `className`, `aria-*`, and `data-*` props by default.\n*   `depth` defines the number of children printed. All children are printed by default.\n*   `verbosity` defines the level of expansion for non-scalar props. The default value of `1` expands objects one level deep.\n\n### `act<T>(action: () => T): T`\n\nPerforms an action in the context of a React [act() block](https://reactjs.org/docs/test-utils.html#act). Normally, you can use `update()` (which uses `act()` internally) to handle asynchronous events. However, in some cases you might need to call `act()` directly, such as when your code uses timers (`setTimeout`, `setInterval`, `clearTimeout`, `clearInterval`), and you want to test using [timer mocks](https://jestjs.io/docs/timer-mocks). When using timer mocks, you need to reset or cleanup mocks between tests (in jest this means calling `runOnlyPendingTimers()` and `useRealTimers()`), otherwise library code that uses timers won’t work properly.\n\n### `find(type: Type, props?: Partial<PropsForComponent<Type>>): Element<PropsForComponent<Type>> | null`\n\nFinds a descendant element that matches `type`, where `type` is a component. If it doesn’t find a matching element, it returns null. If it finds a match, the returned element has the correct prop typing, which provides excellent type safety while navigating the React tree.\n\nIf the second `props` argument is passed, it finds the first element of `type` with matching `props`.\n\n`// App.tsx import {Button, ContextView} from '@stripe/ui-extension-sdk/ui';  const App = () => (   <ContextView title=\"Hello world\">     <Button href=\"[http://bad.example.com](http://bad.example.com/)\">Do not press me</Button>     <Button href=\"[http://example.com](http://example.com/)\">Press me</Button>   </ContextView> );  export default App;  // App.test.tsx import {render} from '@stripe/ui-extension-sdk/testing'; import {Button} from '@stripe/ui-extension-sdk/ui'; import App from './App';  it('contains a Button with text', () => {   const {wrapper} = render(<App />);    const button = wrapper.find(Button, {href: '[http://example.com](http://example.com/)'});    expect(button).toContainText('Press me'); });`\n\nBe aware that when using any of the `findX` methods, saved results are immediately stale and future updates to the component aren’t reflected. For example:\n\n`// Bad - this will not work const button = wrapper.find(Button); expect(button).toContainText('Press me'); button!.trigger('onPress'); expect(button).toContainText('You pressed me!'); // button still contains 'Press me'  // Good - this will work expect(wrapper.find(Button)).toContainText('Press me'); wrapper.find(Button)!.trigger('onPress'); expect(wrapper.find(Button)).toContainText('You pressed me!');`\n\n### `findAll(type: Type, props?: Partial<PropsForComponent<Type>>): Element<PropsForComponent<Type>>[]`\n\nLike `find`, but returns all matches as an array.\n\n### `findWhere<Type = unknown>(predicate: (element: Element<unknown>) => boolean): Element<PropsForComponent<Type>> | null`\n\nFinds the first descendant component matching the passed function. The function is called with each element from `descendants` until it finds a match. If it doesn’t find a match, it returns `null`.\n\n`findWhere` accepts an optional TypeScript argument that you can use to specify the type of the returned element. If you omit the generic argument, the returned element has unknown props, so calling `.props` and `.trigger` on it causes type errors, as those functions don’t know what props are valid on your element:\n\n`// App.tsx import {Button, ContextView} from '@stripe/ui-extension-sdk/ui';  const App = () => (   <ContextView title=\"Hello world\">     <Button href=\"[http://example.com](http://example.com/)\">Press me</Button>   </ContextView> );  export default App;  // App.test.tsx import {render} from '@stripe/ui-extension-sdk/testing'; import {Button} from '@stripe/ui-extension-sdk/ui'; import App from './App';  it('contains a Button with a href', () => {   const {wrapper} = render(<App />);    const button = wrapper.findWhere<typeof Button>(     (node) => node.is(Button) && node.prop('href').startsWith('[http://example](http://example/)'),   );    expect(button).toContainText('Press me'); });`\n\n### `findAllWhere<Type = unknown>(predicate: (element: Element<unknown>) => boolean): Element<PropsForComponent<Type>>[]`\n\nLike `findWhere`, but returns all matches as an array.\n\n### `is(type: Type): boolean`\n\nReturns a boolean indicating whether the component type matches the passed type. This function also serves as a type guard, so subsequent calls to values like `props` are typed as the prop type of the passed component.\n\n`import {Button} from '@stripe/ui-extension-sdk/ui';  // If we omit element.is here, we would not know whether 'href' was a valid prop and Typescript // would throw an error. if (element.is(Button) && element.prop('href') === '[http://example.com](http://example.com/)') {   // ... }`\n\n### `prop<K extends keyof Props>(key: K): Props[K]`\n\nReturns the current value of the passed prop name.\n\n### `props: Props`\n\nAll props of the element.\n\n### `text: string`\n\nThe text content of the element (that is, the string you would get by calling `textContent`).\n\n### `trigger<K extends FunctionKeys<Props>>(prop: K, ...args: Arguments<Props<K>>): ReturnType<Props<K>>`\n\nSimulates a function prop being called on your component. This is usually the key to effective testing. After you mount your component, you simulate a change in a subcomponent and assert that the resulting tree is in the expected state.\n\nOptionally, each additional argument passed to `trigger` is passed to the function. This is useful for testing components in isolation.\n\n`// App.tsx import {useState} from 'react'; import {ContextView, Button} from '@stripe/ui-extension-sdk/ui';  const App = () => {   const [buttonText, setButtonText] = useState<string>('Press me');   return (     <ContextView title=\"Hello world\">       <Button onPress={() => setButtonText('You pressed me!')}>         {buttonText}       </Button>     </ContextView>   ); };  export default App;  // App.test.tsx import {render} from '@stripe/ui-extension-sdk/testing'; import {Button} from '@stripe/ui-extension-sdk/ui'; import App from './App';  describe('App', () => {   it('changes button text when pressed', () => {     const {wrapper} = render(<App />);      expect(wrapper.find(Button)).toContainText('Press me');      // Press the button     wrapper.find(Button)!.trigger('onPress', 'You pressed me!');      // Expect that the text changed     expect(wrapper.find(Button)).toContainText('You pressed me!');   }); });`\n\n### `triggerKeypath<T>(keypath: string, ...args: any[]): T`\n\nLike `trigger()`, but allows you to provide a keypath referencing nested objects. Be aware that limitations in TypeScript prevent the same kind of type-safety that `trigger` guarantees.\n\n`const App = ({action}: {action: {onAction(): void; label: string}}) => (   <Button type=\"button\" onPress={action.onAction}>     {action.label}   </Button> );  const spy = jest.fn(); const app = mount(   <App action={{label: 'Hi', onAction: spy}} />, ); app.triggerKeypath('action.onAction'); expect(spy).toHaveBeenCalled();`\n\n## Matchers![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe Extension SDK provides [Jest custom matchers](https://jestjs.io/docs/using-matchers). These are imported automatically when you import `@stripe/ui-extension-sdk/testing`.\n\n### `toContainComponent(type: RemoteComponentType, props?: object)`\n\nAsserts that at least one component matching `type` is in the descendants of the passed node. If the second `props` argument is passed, it further filters the matches by components whose props are equal to the passed object. Jest’s asymmetric matchers, like `expect.objectContaining`, are fully supported.\n\n`// App.tsx import {Button, ContextView} from '@stripe/ui-extension-sdk/ui';  const App = () => (   <ContextView title=\"Hello world\">     <Button onPress={() => console.log('You pressed me!')}>Press me</Button>   </ContextView> );  export default App;  // App.test.tsx import {render} from '@stripe/ui-extension-sdk/testing'; import {Button} from '@stripe/ui-extension-sdk/ui'; import App from './App';  it('contains a Button', () => {   const {wrapper} = render(<App />);    expect(wrapper).toContainComponent(Button, {     onPress: expect.any(Function),   }); });`\n\n### `toContainComponentTimes(type: RemoteComponentType, times: number, props?: object)`\n\nIdentical to `.toContainComponent`, but asserts that there are exactly `times` matches within the passed node.\n\n### `toHaveProps(props: object)`\n\nChecks whether the node has the specified props.\n\n`// App.tsx import {Button, ContextView} from '@stripe/ui-extension-sdk/ui';  const App = () => (   <ContextView title=\"Hello world\">     <Button onPress={() => console.log('You pressed me!')}>Press me</Button>   </ContextView> );  export default App;  // App.test.tsx import {render} from '@stripe/ui-extension-sdk/testing'; import {Button} from '@stripe/ui-extension-sdk/ui'; import App from './App';  it('contains a Button with an onPress function', () => {   const {wrapper} = render(<App />);    expect(wrapper.find(Button)).toHaveProps({     onPress: expect.any(Function),   }); });`\n\n### `toContainText(text: string)`\n\nChecks that the rendered output of the component contains the passed string as text content (that is, the text is included in what you would get by calling `textContent` on all DOM nodes rendered by the component).\n\n`// App.tsx import {Button, ContextView} from '@stripe/ui-extension-sdk/ui';  const App = () => (   <ContextView title=\"Hello world\">     <Button>Press me</Button>   </ContextView> );  export default App;  // App.test.tsx import {render} from '@stripe/ui-extension-sdk/testing'; import {Button} from '@stripe/ui-extension-sdk/ui'; import App from './App';  it('contains a Button with an onPress function', () => {   const {wrapper} = render(<App />);    expect(wrapper.find(Button)).toContainText('Press me'); });`\n\n## Mock context props![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nApp views are passed [context props](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/reference/extensions-sdk-api#props) in the Stripe Dashboard. You can generate a mock context props object for testing purposes using the `getMockContextProps` function.\n\n`import {getMockContextProps} from '@stripe/ui-extension-sdk/testing';  const context = getMockContextProps(); const {wrapper} = render(<App {...context} />);`\n\nBy default, the mock context props are standard test values like `id: 'usr_1234'` and `email: 'user@example.com'`. You can override these values by passing in a partial object. The object you pass in is deep-merged with the default object, so you only need to pass in the values you want to override.\n\n`import {getMockContextProps} from '@stripe/ui-extension-sdk/testing';  const context = getMockContextProps({   environment: {     objectContext: {       id: 'inv_1234',       object: 'invoice',     },   }, }); const {wrapper} = render(<App {...context} />);`",

  "markdown": "# Update a PaymentIntent | Stripe API Reference\n\nUpdates properties on a PaymentIntent object without confirming.\n\nDepending on which properties you update, you might need to confirm the PaymentIntent again. For example, updating the `payment_method` always requires you to confirm the PaymentIntent again. If you prefer to update and confirm at the same time, we recommend updating properties through the [confirm API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/confirm) instead.\n\n### Parameters\n\n*   Amount intended to be collected by this PaymentIntent. A positive integer representing how much to charge in the [smallest currency unit](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#zero-decimal) (e.g., 100 cents to charge $1.00 or 100 to charge ¥100, a zero-decimal currency). The minimum amount is $0.50 US or [equivalent in charge currency](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts). The amount value supports up to eight digits (e.g., a value of 99999999 for a USD charge of $999,999.99).\n    \n\n*   ID of the Customer this PaymentIntent belongs to, if one exists.\n    \n    Payment methods attached to other Customers cannot be used with this PaymentIntent.\n    \n    If present in combination with [setup\\_future\\_usage](#payment_intent_object-setup_future_usage), this PaymentIntent’s payment method will be attached to the Customer after the PaymentIntent has been confirmed and any required actions from the user are complete.\n    \n*   An arbitrary string attached to the object. Often useful for displaying to users.\n    \n*   Set of [key-value pairs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/metadata) that you can attach to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format. Individual keys can be unset by posting an empty value to them. All keys can be unset by posting an empty value to `metadata`.\n    \n*   ID of the payment method (a PaymentMethod, Card, or [compatible Source](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/transitioning#compatibility) object) to attach to this PaymentIntent.\n    \n*   Email address that the receipt for the resulting payment will be sent to. If `receipt_email` is specified for a payment in live mode, a receipt will be sent regardless of your [email settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/emails).\n    \n*   Indicates that you intend to make future payments with this PaymentIntent’s payment method.\n    \n    Providing this parameter will [attach the payment method](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/save-during-payment) to the PaymentIntent’s Customer, if present, after the PaymentIntent is confirmed and any required actions from the user are complete. If no Customer was provided, the payment method can still be [attached](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods/attach) to a Customer after the transaction completes.\n    \n    When processing card payments, Stripe also uses `setup_future_usage` to dynamically optimize your payment flow and comply with regional legislation and network rules, such as [SCA](https://docs.stripe.com/strong-customer-authentication).\n    \n    If `setup_future_usage` is already set and you are performing a request using a publishable key, you may only update the value from `on_session` to `off_session`.\n    \n    Possible enum values\n    \n    |     |\n    | --- |\n    | `off_session`<br><br>Use `off_session` if your customer may or may not be present in your checkout flow. |\n    | `on_session`<br><br>Use `on_session` if you intend to only reuse the payment method when your customer is present in your checkout flow. |\n    \n*   Shipping information for this PaymentIntent.\n    \n*   #### \n    \n    statement\\_descriptorstring\n    \n    For card charges, use [statement\\_descriptor\\_suffix](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/account/statement-descriptors#dynamic). Otherwise, you can use this value as the complete description of a charge on your customers’ statements. It must contain at least one letter and be 1–22 characters long.\n    \n*   #### \n    \n    statement\\_descriptor\\_suffixstring\n    \n    Provides information about a card payment that customers see on their statements. Concatenated with the prefix (shortened descriptor) or statement descriptor that’s set on the account to form the complete statement descriptor.

If the confirmation is successful, values present on the ConfirmationToken are written onto the Intent.\n\nTo learn more about how to use ConfirmationToken, visit the related guides:\n\n*   [Finalize payments on the server](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/finalize-payments-on-the-server)\n*   [Build two-step confirmation](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/build-a-two-step-confirmation).\n\n## [Tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens)\n\nTokenization is the process Stripe uses to collect sensitive card or bank account details, or personally identifiable information (PII), directly from your customers in a secure manner. A token representing this information is returned to your server to use. Use our [recommended payments integrations](https://docs.stripe.com/payments) to perform this process on the client-side. This guarantees that no sensitive card data touches your server, and allows your integration to operate in a PCI-compliant way.\n\nIf you can’t use client-side tokenization, you can also create tokens using the API with either your publishable or secret API key. If your integration uses this method, you’re responsible for any PCI compliance that it might require, and you must keep your secret API key safe. Unlike with client-side tokenization, your customer’s information isn’t sent directly to Stripe, so we can’t determine how it’s handled or stored.\n\nYou can’t store or use tokens more than once. To store card or bank account information for later use, create [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api#customers) objects or [External accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/api#external_accounts). [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar), our integrated solution for automatic fraud protection, performs best with integrations that use client-side tokenization.\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_account)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_bank_account)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_card)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_cvc_update)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_person)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_pii)[GET/v1/tokens/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/retrieve)\n\n## [Cash Balance](https://docs.stripe.com/api/cash_balance)\n\nA customer’s `Cash balance` represents real funds. Customers can add funds to their cash balance by sending a bank transfer. These funds can be used for payment and can eventually be paid out to your bank account.\n\n## [Customer Portal Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customer_portal/sessions)\n\nThe Billing customer portal is a Stripe-hosted UI for subscription and billing management.\n\nA portal configuration describes the functionality and features that you want to provide to your customers through the portal.\n\nA portal session describes the instantiation of the customer portal for a particular customer. By visiting the session’s URL, the customer can manage their subscriptions and billing details. For security reasons, sessions are short-lived and will expire if the customer does not visit the URL. Create sessions on-demand when customers intend to manage their subscriptions and billing details.\n\nRelated guide: [Customer management](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management)\n\n## [Invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices)\n\nInvoices are statements of amounts owed by a customer, and are either generated one-off, or generated periodically from a subscription.\n\nThey contain [invoice items](#invoiceitems), and proration adjustments that may be caused by subscription upgrades/downgrades (if necessary).\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed through automatic charges, Stripe automatically finalizes your invoice and attempts payment. Note that finalizing the invoice, [when automatic](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/automatic-advancement-collection), does not happen immediately as the invoice is created. Stripe waits until one hour after the last webhook was successfully sent (or the last webhook timed out after failing). If you (and the platforms you may have connected to) have no webhooks configured, Stripe waits one hour after creation to finalize the invoice.\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed by sending an email, then based on your [email settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/billing/automatic), Stripe will email the invoice to your customer and await payment. These emails can contain a link to a hosted page to pay the invoice.\n\nStripe applies any customer credit on the account before determining the amount due for the invoice (i.e., the amount that will be actually charged). If the amount due for the invoice is less than Stripe’s [minimum allowed charge per currency](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts), the invoice is automatically marked paid, and we add the amount due to the customer’s credit balance which is applied to the next invoice.\n\nMore details on the customer’s credit balance are [here](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/customer/balance).\n\nRelated guide: [Send invoices to customers](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/invoices/sending)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create)[POST/v1/invoices/create\\_preview](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create_preview)[POST/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/lines/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_line)[GET/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/retrieve)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming)[GET/v1/invoices/:id/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming_invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/list)[DELETE/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/delete)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/add\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/add_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/remove\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/remove_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/update\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/finalize](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/finalize)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/mark\\_uncollectible](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/mark_uncollectible)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/pay](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/pay)[GET/v1/invoices/search](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/search)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/send](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/send)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/void](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/void)\n\n## [Meter Events](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event)\n\nA billing meter event represents a customer’s usage of a product. Meter events are used to bill a customer based on their usage. Meter events are associated with billing meters, which define the shape of the event’s payload and how those events are aggregated for billing.\n\n## [Meter Event Adjustment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_adjustment)\n\nA billing meter event adjustment is a resource that allows you to cancel a meter event. For example, you might create a billing meter event adjustment to cancel a meter event that was created in error or attached to the wrong customer.\n\n## [Meter Event Summary](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_summary)\n\nA billing meter event summary represents an aggregated view of a customer’s billing meter events within a specified timeframe. It indicates how much usage was accrued by a customer for that period.\n\n## [Plans](https://docs.stripe.com/api/plans)\n\nYou can now model subscriptions more flexibly using the [Prices API](#prices). It replaces the Plans API and is backwards compatible to simplify your migration.\n\nPlans define the base price, currency, and billing cycle for recurring purchases of products. [Products](#products) help you track inventory or provisioning, and plans help you track pricing. Different physical goods or levels of service should be represented by products, and pricing options should be represented by plans. This approach lets you change prices without having to change your provisioning scheme.\n\nFor example, you might have a single “gold” product that has plans for $10/month, $100/year, €9/month, and €90/year.\n\nRelated guides: [Set up a subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/set-up-subscription) and more about [products and prices](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/overview).\n\n## [Tax IDs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_create)[POST/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/create)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_retrieve)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/retrieve)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_list)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/list)[DELETE/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_delete)[DELETE/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/delete)\n\n## [Account Links](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_links)\n\nAccount Links are the means by which a Connect platform grants a connected account permission to access Stripe-hosted applications, such as Connect Onboarding.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect Onboarding](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom/hosted-onboarding)\n\n## [Account Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_sessions)\n\nAn AccountSession allows a Connect platform to grant access to a connected account in Connect embedded components.\n\nWe recommend that you create an AccountSession each time you need to display an embedded component to your user. Do not save AccountSessions to your database as they expire relatively quickly, and cannot be used more than once.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect embedded components](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-connect-embedded-components)\n\n## [Application Fees](https://docs.stripe.com/api/application_fees)\n\nWhen you collect a transaction fee on top of a charge made for your user (using [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)), an `Application Fee` object is created in your account. You can list, retrieve, and refund application fees.\n\nRelated guide: [Collecting application fees](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges#collect-fees)\n\n## [Country Specs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/country_specs)\n\nStripe needs to collect certain pieces of information about each account created. These requirements can differ depending on the account’s country. The Country Specs API makes these rules available to your integration.\n\nYou can also view the information from this API call as [an online guide](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information).\n\n## [Person](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/create)[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/update)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/retrieve)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/list)[DELETE/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/delete)\n\n## [Transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/transfers)\n\nA `Transfer` object is created when you move funds between Stripe accounts as part of Connect.\n\nBefore April 6, 2017, transfers also represented movement of funds from a Stripe account to a card or bank account. This behavior has since been split out into a [Payout](#payout_object) object, with corresponding payout endpoints. For more information, read about the [transfer/payout split](https://docs.stripe.com/transfer-payout-split).\n\nRelated guide: [Creating separate charges and transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n\n## [Secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/secret_management)\n\nSecret Store is an API that allows Stripe Apps developers to securely persist secrets for use by UI Extensions and app backends.\n\nThe primary resource in Secret Store is a `secret`. Other apps can’t view secrets created by an app. Additionally, secrets are scoped to provide further permission control.\n\nAll Dashboard users and the app backend share `account` scoped secrets. Use the `account` scope for secrets that don’t change per-user, like a third-party API key.\n\nA `user` scoped secret is accessible by the app backend and one specific Dashboard user. Use the `user` scope for per-user secrets like per-user OAuth tokens, where different users might have different permissions.\n\nRelated guide: [Store data between page reloads](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/store-auth-data-custom-objects)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[GET/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/list)[POST/v1/apps/secrets/delete](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/delete)[GET/v1/apps/secrets/find](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/find)[POST/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/set)\n\n## [Reviews](https://docs.stripe.com/api/radar/reviews)\n\nReviews can be used to supplement automated fraud detection with human expertise.\n\nLearn more about [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar) and reviewing payments [here](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/reviews).\n\n## [Authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/update)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/list)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/approve](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/approve)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/decline](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/decline)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_create)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/capture](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_capture)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/expire](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_expire)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/finalize\\_amount](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_finalize_amount)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/increment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_increment)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/fraud\\_challenges/respond](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/respond_to_fraud_challenges)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/reverse](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_reverse)\n\n## [Cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/create)[POST/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/update)[GET/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/list)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/deliver](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_deliver)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/fail](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_fail)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/return](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_return)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/ship](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_ship)\n\n## [Physical Bundles](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/physical_bundles)\n\nA Physical Bundle represents the bundle of physical items -

For example, WisePOS E is a TerminalHardwareProduct and a WisePOS E - US and WisePOS E - UK are TerminalHardwareSKUs.\n\n## [Terminal Hardware SKU](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_skus)Preview feature\n\nA TerminalHardwareSKU represents a SKU for Terminal hardware. A SKU is a representation of a product available for purchase, containing information such as the name, price, and images.\n\n## [Transaction Entries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/transaction_entries)\n\nTransactionEntries represent individual units of money movements within a single [Transaction](#transactions).\n\n## [Scheduled Queries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/sigma/scheduled_queries)\n\nIf you have [scheduled a Sigma query](https://docs.stripe.com/sigma/scheduled-queries), you’ll receive a `sigma.scheduled_query_run.created` webhook each time the query runs. The webhook contains a `ScheduledQueryRun` object, which you can use to retrieve the query results.\n\n## [Report Types](https://docs.stripe.com/api/reporting/report_type)\n\nThe Report Type resource corresponds to a particular type of report, such as the “Activity summary” or “Itemized payouts” reports. These objects are identified by an ID belonging to a set of enumerated values. See [API Access to Reports documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/reporting/statements/api) for those Report Type IDs, along with required and optional parameters.\n\nNote that certain report types can only be run based on your live-mode data (not test-mode data), and will error when queried without a [live-mode API key](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#test-live-modes).\n\n## [Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/financial_connections/sessions)\n\nA Financial Connections Session is the secure way to programmatically launch the client-side Stripe.js modal that lets your users link their accounts.\n\n## [Verification Report](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_reports)\n\nA VerificationReport is the result of an attempt to collect and verify data from a user. The collection of verification checks performed is determined from the `type` and `options` parameters used. You can find the result of each verification check performed in the appropriate sub-resource: `document`, `id_number`, `selfie`.\n\nEach VerificationReport contains a copy of any data collected by the user as well as reference IDs which can be used to access collected images through the [FileUpload](https://docs.stripe.com/api/files) API. To configure and create VerificationReports, use the [VerificationSession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_sessions) API.\n\nRelated guide: [Accessing verification results](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verification-sessions#results).\n\n## [Crypto Onramp Quotes](https://docs.stripe.com/api/crypto/onramp_quotes)\n\nCrypto Onramp Quotes are estimated quotes for onramp conversions into all the different cryptocurrencies on different networks. The Quotes API allows you to display quotes in your product UI before directing the user to the onramp widget.\n\nRelated guide: [Quotes API](https://docs.stripe.com/crypto/quotes-api)\n\n## [Climate Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/climate/product)\n\nA Climate product represents a type of carbon removal unit available for reservation.

The destination URL is activated by Stripe at the time of onboarding. Stripe verifies requests with your credentials provided during onboarding, and injects card details from the payment\\_method into the request.\n\nStripe redacts all sensitive fields and headers, including authentication credentials and card numbers, before storing the request and response data in the forwarding Request object, which are subject to a 30-day retention period.\n\nYou can provide a Stripe idempotency key to make sure that requests with the same key result in only one outbound request. The Stripe idempotency key provided should be unique and different from any idempotency keys provided on the underlying third-party request.\n\nForwarding Requests are synchronous requests that return a response or time out according to Stripe’s limits.\n\nRelated guide: [Forward card details to third-party API endpoints](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/forwarding).\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/create)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/retrieve)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/list)",

  "markdown": "# Controlling bank and debit card transfers\n\n## Stripe allows platforms to entirely control the transfers for its Custom Connect accounts.\n\n#### Caution\n\nThis page describes an older version of [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect \"Connect\"). In the latest version of Connect, the legacy `transfers` endpoint has been deprecated in favor of `payouts`. The Dashboard’s user interface reflects this change, using the term “[payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts \"payout\")” instead of transfers, regardless of your Stripe API version. Refer to [bank and debit card payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/payouts-connected-accounts) for information about the latest version of the Connect API.\n\nBy default, any charge you make on behalf of a connected account accumulates in the connected account’s [Stripe balance](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-balances) and is paid out on a daily rolling basis. However, Stripe offers fine-grained control over this behavior for Custom accounts.\n\nYou can:\n\n*   Set the destination [bank accounts and debit cards](#bank-accounts)\n*   Control [how frequently](#payout-information) funds are automatically paid out\n*   Perform [manual transfers](#using-manual-transfers)\n*   Send funds [instantly](#instant-payouts)\n\n## Managing bank accounts and debit cards ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nCustom accounts have an `external_accounts` property: a list of all bank accounts and debit cards associated with the Stripe account. Any external account is a possible destination for funds.\n\n`{   \"id\":` \n\n`\"{{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}\"`\n\n`,   \"object\": \"account\",   \"external_accounts\": {     \"object\": \"list\",     \"has_more\": false,     \"url\": \"/v1/accounts/acct_14qyt6Alijdnw0EA/external_accounts\",     \"data\": [       {         \"id\":   \"{{BANK_ACCOUNT_ID}}\"  ,         \"object\": \"bank_account\",         \"account\": \"acct_14qyt6Alijdnw0EA\",         \"account_holder_name\": \"Jane Austen\",         \"account_holder_type\": \"individual\",         \"bank_name\": \"STRIPE TEST BANK\",         \"country\": \"US\",         \"currency\": \"usd\",         \"default_for_currency\": false,         \"fingerprint\": \"sSZ2yLp0EZTH17cF\",         \"last4\": \"6789\",         \"metadata\": {         },         \"routing_number\": \"110000000\",         \"status\": \"new\"       },       {...},       {...},     ],   ... }`\n\nDestination accounts are added via the `external_accounts` parameter when [creating](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom-accounts#create) or [updating](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/updating-service-agreements) Stripe accounts. The value should be a bank account or debit card token returned from [Stripe.js](https://docs.stripe.com/js). Alternatively, you can provide a hash of the bank account details, but using Stripe.js is preferred as it prevents sensitive data from hitting your server.\n\nWhen using debit cards as a transfer destination, the following restrictions apply:\n\n*   Must be a non-prepaid US Visa, Mastercard, or Discover\n*   Limited to 9,999 USD per transfer on [Instant Payouts](#instant-payouts)\n*   Generally limited to 3,000 USD per transfer otherwise\n\n## Managing multiple bank and debit accounts ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nBy default, providing a new value for `external_accounts` while updating a Custom account _replaces_ the existing account with the new one. To _add_ additional bank accounts or debit cards to a connected account, use the [Bank Account](https://docs.stripe.com/api#account_create_bank_account) and [Card](https://docs.stripe.com/api#account_create_card) creation API endpoints.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/accounts/`\n\n`{{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}`\n\n`/external_accounts \\  -u \"  sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc  :\" \\  -d external_account=  {{BANK_ACCOUNT_TOKEN_ID}}    `\n\nWhen working with multiple currencies, Stripe automatically sends transfers to an associated bank account or debit card for its currency, thereby avoiding exchange fees. When there are multiple accounts available for a given currency, Stripe uses the one set as `default_for_currency`.\n\nStripe maintains a list of [available country/currency combinations](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/payouts-connected-accounts) for your reference and to help your users choose from the supported options.\n\n## Payout information![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nWhen using automatic transfers, the `transfer_schedule` property on an account indicates how often the Stripe account’s balance is automatically paid out:\n\n`{   ...   \"transfer_schedule\": {     \"delay_days\": 7,     \"interval\": \"daily\"   },   ... }`\n\nThe `delay_days` property reflects how long it takes charges (or linked transfers) to become available for payout. This field is useful for controlling automatic payouts. For example, if you want your Custom accounts to receive their funds 2 weeks after the charge is made, set `interval` to `daily` and `delay_days` to **14**. The default is the lowest permitted value for the account, determined by the connected account’s country. When setting or updating this field, you may pass the string **minimum** to choose the lowest permitted value.\n\nThere are four possible settings for the `interval` property:\n\n*   **manual** prevents automatic payouts. You will have to manually pay out the account’s balance using the [Transfers API](https://docs.stripe.com/api#create_transfer) (acting as the connected account). Also set an account to `manual` to use [Instant Payouts](#instant-payouts).\n*   **daily** automatically pays out charges `delay_days` days after they’re created. The `delay_days` value cannot be less than your own transfer schedule or less than the default transfer schedule for the account.\n*   **weekly** automatically pays out the balance once a week, specified by the `weekly_anchor` parameter (a lower-case weekday such as **monday**).\n*   **monthly** automatically pays out the balance once a month, specified by the `monthly_anchor` parameter (a number from 1 to 31).\n\n## Using manual transfers![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nIf you set `transfer_schedule[interval]` to `manual` using the [Accounts API](https://docs.stripe.com/api#account_object-transfer_schedule), Stripe will hold funds in the account holder’s balance until told to pay them out (or until a maximum of 90 days have passed). To trigger a payout of these funds, use the [Transfers API](https://docs.stripe.com/api#create_transfer).\n\nThe Transfers API is only for moving funds from a connected Stripe account’s balance into their external account. To move funds between Stripe accounts, see creating [separate charges and transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers) or [creating destination charges through the platform](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges).\n\n#### Note\n\n_Escrow_ has a precise legal definition and Stripe does not support escrow accounts. However, we do provide escrow-like behavior through manual transfers. This gives you control over transfer timing, with the ability to delay payouts to Custom accounts for up to 90 days.\n\nManual transfers can be used as an alternative to escrow when there may be a risk of a delayed delivery, or if there’s the possibility of a refund being needed.\n\n### Standard transfers![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nAs a basic transfer example, to have 10 USD sent from a Custom account’s Stripe balance to their external account:\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/transfers \\   -u` \n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`: \\   -H \"Stripe-Account: {{CONNECTED_STRIPE_ACCOUNT_ID}}\" \\   -d \"amount\"=1000 \\   -d \"currency\"=\"usd\" \\   -d \"destination\"=\"default_for_currency\"`\n\nSetting `destination=default_for_currency` tells Stripe to transfer to the account’s default bank account or debit card for the given currency.\n\nWith a standard transfer, you can payout up to the user’s available balance. To find that amount, perform a [retrieve balance](https://docs.stripe.com/api#retrieve_balance) call on their behalf.\n\nStripe tracks balance contributions from different payment sources in separate balances. The retrieve balance response breaks down the components of each balance by source type. For example, if you want to create a transfer specifically for a non-credit-card balance, specify the `source_type` in your request.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/transfers \\   -u` \n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`: \\   -d \"amount\"=24784 \\   -d \"currency\"=\"usd\" \\   -d \"destination\"=\"default_for_currency\" \\   -d \"source_type\"=\"bank_account\"`\n\nNote that it is possible for any source’s balance component to go negative (through refunds or chargebacks), and transfers can’t be created for greater than the aggregate available balance.\n\n### Using Instant Payouts ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nWith Instant Payouts, you can immediately send funds to a Custom account’s debit card. Funds typically appear in the associated bank account within 30 minutes, making it possible to go from charge to payout in mere moments.\n\nTo use Instant Payouts, specify **instant** for the `method` property when creating the transfer:\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/transfers \\   -u` \n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`: \\   -H \"Stripe-Account: {{CONNECTED_STRIPE_ACCOUNT_ID}}\" \\   -d \"amount\"=1000 \\   -d \"currency\"=\"usd\" \\   -d \"method\"=\"instant\"`\n\nInstant Payouts differ from other manual transfers in a couple of ways:\n\n*   You can transfer an account’s available balance plus its _pending_ balance\n*   Instant Payouts can be requested on weekends and holidays\n\nInitially, platforms can transfer up to 500 USD per day—in total, across all connected accounts—through Instant Payouts. [Contact us](https://support.stripe.com/contact) if you need this threshold increased.\n\nInstant Payouts is available for all of the largest US banks, but a small percentage of banks do not yet support it. For those banks, you will have to fall back to standard payouts.\n\nWhen you add a card to an account, Stripe returns a property `available_payout_methods` in the response, which will be a set containing the payout methods Stripe supports for that card. Only values in this set should be passed as the `method` when creating a transfer.\n\n`{   \"id\":` \n\n`\"{{CARD_ID}}\"`\n\n`,   \"object\": \"card\",   ...   \"account\": \"acct_1032D82eZvKYlo2C\",   \"available_payout_methods\": [\"standard\", \"instant\"], }`\n\nIf a Custom account’s card does not support Instant Payouts, you should clearly communicate to the owner of that account that they will not receive their payouts instantly.\n\n### Using webhooks with transfers ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nAll transfer activity on connected accounts can be tracked using [webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks). (When using Connect, you should always be using webhooks.) Specific to transfers, you’ll see these events:\n\n*   `transfer.created`\n*   `transfer.updated`\n*   `transfer.paid`\n*   `transfer.failed`\n\nFor most transfers, these event notifications occur over a series of days. Instant Payouts typically send `transfer.paid` within 30 minutes.\n\nIf a transfer cannot be completed, a `transfer.failed` event occurs. The event’s `failure_reason` property indicates why.",

Upon confirmation, the PaymentIntent will attempt to initiate a payment. If the selected payment method requires additional authentication steps, the PaymentIntent will transition to the `requires_action` status and suggest additional actions via `next_action`. If payment fails, the PaymentIntent transitions to the `requires_payment_method` status or the `canceled` status if the confirmation limit is reached. If payment succeeds, the PaymentIntent will transition to the `succeeded` status (or `requires_capture`, if `capture_method` is set to `manual`). If the `confirmation_method` is `automatic`, payment may be attempted using our [client SDKs](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-js/reference#stripe-handle-card-payment) and the PaymentIntent’s [client\\_secret](#payment_intent_object-client_secret). After `next_action`s are handled by the client, no additional confirmation is required to complete the payment. If the `confirmation_method` is `manual`, all payment attempts must be initiated using a secret key. If any actions are required for the payment, the PaymentIntent will return to the `requires_confirmation` state after those actions are completed. Your server needs to then explicitly re-confirm the PaymentIntent to initiate the next payment attempt.\n\n### Parameters\n\n*   ID of the payment method (a PaymentMethod, Card, or [compatible Source](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/transitioning#compatibility) object) to attach to this PaymentIntent.\n    \n*   Email address that the receipt for the resulting payment will be sent to. If `receipt_email` is specified for a payment in live mode, a receipt will be sent regardless of your [email settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/emails).\n    \n*   Indicates that you intend to make future payments with this PaymentIntent’s payment method.\n    \n    Providing this parameter will [attach the payment method](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/save-during-payment) to the PaymentIntent’s Customer, if present, after the PaymentIntent is confirmed and any required actions from the user are complete. If no Customer was provided, the payment method can still be [attached](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods/attach) to a Customer after the transaction completes.\n    \n    When processing card payments, Stripe also uses `setup_future_usage` to dynamically optimize your payment flow and comply with regional legislation and network rules, such as [SCA](https://docs.stripe.com/strong-customer-authentication).\n    \n    If `setup_future_usage` is already set and you are performing a request using a publishable key, you may only update the value from `on_session` to `off_session`.\n    \n    Possible enum values\n    \n    |     |\n    | --- |\n    | `off_session`<br><br>Use `off_session` if your customer may or may not be present in your checkout flow. |\n    | `on_session`<br><br>Use `on_session` if you intend to only reuse the payment method when your customer is present in your checkout flow. |\n    \n*   Shipping information for this PaymentIntent.\n    \n\n### More parameters\n\n*   #### \n    \n    capture\\_methodenumsecret key only\n    \n\n*   #### \n    \n    error\\_on\\_requires\\_actionboolean\n    \n*   #### \n    \n    mandatestringsecret key only\n    \n\n*   #### \n    \n    off\\_sessionboolean | stringsecret key only\n    \n*   #### \n    \n    payment\\_method\\_dataobject\n    \n*   #### \n    \n    payment\\_method\\_optionsobjectsecret key only\n    \n*   #### \n    \n    payment\\_method\\_typesarray of stringssecret key only\n    \n*   #### \n    \n    radar\\_optionsobjectsecret key only\n    \n\n### Returns\n\nReturns the resulting PaymentIntent after all possible transitions are applied.\n\nPOST /v1/payment\\_intents/:id/confirm\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/payment_intents/pi_3MtweELkdIwHu7ix0Dt0gF2H/confirm \\  -u \"sk_test_4eC39Hq...arjtT1zdp7dcsk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc:\" \\  -d payment_method=pm_card_visa \\  --data-urlencode return_url=\"https://www.example.com\"\n```\n\n```\n{  \"id\": \"pi_3MtweELkdIwHu7ix0Dt0gF2H\",  \"object\": \"payment_intent\",  \"amount\": 2000,  \"amount_capturable\": 0,  \"amount_details\": {    \"tip\": {}  },  \"amount_received\": 2000,  \"application\": null,  \"application_fee_amount\": null,  \"automatic_payment_methods\": {    \"enabled\": true  },  \"canceled_at\": null,  \"cancellation_reason\": null,  \"capture_method\": \"automatic\",  \"client_secret\": \"pi_3MtweELkdIwHu7ix0Dt0gF2H_secret_ALlpPMIZse0ac8YzPxkMkFgGC\",  \"confirmation_method\": \"automatic\",  \"created\": 1680802258,  \"currency\": \"usd\",  \"customer\": null,  \"description\": null,  \"invoice\": null,  \"last_payment_error\": null,  \"latest_charge\": \"ch_3MtweELkdIwHu7ix05lnLAFd\",  \"livemode\": false,  \"metadata\": {},  \"next_action\": null,  \"on_behalf_of\": null,  \"payment_method\": \"pm_1MtweELkdIwHu7ixxrsejPtG\",  \"payment_method_options\": {    \"card\": {      \"installments\": null,      \"mandate_options\": null,      \"network\": null,      \"request_three_d_secure\": \"automatic\"    },    \"link\": {      \"persistent_token\": null    }  },  \"payment_method_types\": [    \"card\",    \"link\"  ],  \"processing\": null,  \"receipt_email\": null,  \"review\": null,  \"setup_future_usage\": null,  \"shipping\": null,  \"source\": null,  \"statement_descriptor\": null,  \"statement_descriptor_suffix\": null,  \"status\": \"succeeded\",  \"transfer_data\": null,  \"transfer_group\": null}\n```\n\n## [Increment an authorization](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/increment_authorization)\n\nPerform an incremental authorization on an eligible [PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object). To be eligible, the PaymentIntent’s status must be `requires_capture` and [incremental\\_authorization\\_supported](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/object#charge_object-payment_method_details-card_present-incremental_authorization_supported) must be `true`.\n\nIncremental authorizations attempt to increase the authorized amount on your customer’s card to the new, higher `amount` provided. Similar to the initial authorization, incremental authorizations can be declined. A single PaymentIntent can call this endpoint multiple times to further increase the authorized amount.\n\nIf the incremental authorization succeeds, the PaymentIntent object returns with the updated [amount](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-amount). If the incremental authorization fails, a [card\\_declined](https://docs.stripe.com/error-codes#card-declined) error returns, and no other fields on the PaymentIntent or Charge update. The PaymentIntent object remains capturable for the previously authorized amount.\n\nEach PaymentIntent can have a maximum of 10 incremental authorization attempts, including declines. After it’s captured, a PaymentIntent can no longer be incremented.\n\nLearn more about [incremental authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/features/incremental-authorizations).\n\n### Parameters\n\n*   The updated total amount that you intend to collect from the cardholder. This amount must be greater than the currently authorized amount.\n    \n*   An arbitrary string attached to the object. Often useful for displaying to users.\n    \n*   Set of [key-value pairs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/metadata) that you can attach to an object.

All keys can be unset by posting an empty value to `metadata`.\n    \n*   #### \n    \n    statement\\_descriptorstring\n    \n    For card charges, use [statement\\_descriptor\\_suffix](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/account/statement-descriptors#dynamic). Otherwise, you can use this value as the complete description of a charge on your customers’ statements. It must contain at least one letter and be 1–22 characters long.\n    \n\n### More parameters\n\n*   #### \n    \n    application\\_fee\\_amountintegerConnect only\n    \n*   #### \n    \n    transfer\\_dataobjectConnect only\n    \n\n### Returns\n\nReturns a PaymentIntent object with the updated amount if the incremental authorization succeeds.

  "markdown": "# iDEAL payments with Sources | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Use Sources to accept payments using iDEAL, the most popular payment method in the Netherlands.\n\n#### Warning\n\nWe deprecated the Sources API and plan to remove support for local payment methods. If you currently integrate with iDEAL using the Sources API, you must [migrate to the Payment Methods API](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/transitioning). We’ll send email communication with more information about this end of support.\n\nFor information about integrating iDEAL with the current APIs, see [iDEAL payments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/ideal).\n\nStripe users in Europe and the United States can accept iDEAL payments from customers in the Netherlands using [Sources](https://docs.stripe.com/sources)—a single integration path for creating payments using any supported method.\n\nDuring the payment process, a [Source](https://docs.stripe.com/api#sources) object is created and your customer is redirected to their bank’s website or mobile application to authorize the payment. After completing this, your integration uses the source to make a charge request and complete the payment.\n\niDEAL is a [push](https://docs.stripe.com/sources#pull-or-push-of-funds)\\-based, [single-use](https://docs.stripe.com/sources#single-use-or-reusable) and [synchronous](https://docs.stripe.com/sources#synchronous-or-asynchronous-confirmation) method of payment. This means your customer takes action to send the amount to you through a [redirect](https://docs.stripe.com/sources#flow-for-customer-action) and there is immediate confirmation about the success or failure of a payment.\n\n[\n\n## Create a Source object![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n\n\n](#create-source)\n\nTo create a `Source` object client-side, follow the [iDEAL Bank Element Quickstart](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/ideal). The iDEAL Bank Element lets your customers select their bank inline (rather than in an interstitial bank selection page) and check out faster. Once you’ve created a source object, you can proceed to customer authorization in the next step.\n\n### Custom client-side source creation![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nIf you choose to collect your customer’s bank yourself or not collect it at all, create your own form and call `stripe.createSource` as described in the [Stripe.js reference](https://docs.stripe.com/js#stripe-create-source). When doing so, make sure to collect the following information from your customer:\n\n| Parameter | Value |\n| --- | --- |\n| `type` | **ideal** |\n| `amount` | A positive integer in the [smallest currency unit](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#zero-decimal) representing the amount to charge the customer (for example, **1099** for a 10.99 EUR payment). |\n| `currency` | **eur** (iDEAL must always use Euros) |\n| `ideal[bank]` (optional) | The customer’s bank. |\n| `redirect[return_url]` | The URL the customer should be redirected to after the authorization process. |\n| `statement_descriptor` (optional) | A custom statement descriptor for the payment. |\n\n### Server-side source creation![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nA `Source` object can also be created server-side using the [Source creation endpoint](https://docs.stripe.com/api#create_source) with the above parameters.\n\nUsing either method, Stripe returns a `Source` object containing the relevant details for the method of payment used. Information specific to iDEAL is provided within the `ideal` subhash.\n\n`{   \"id\": \"src_16xhynE8WzK49JbAs9M21jaR\",   \"object\": \"source\",   \"amount\": 1099,   \"client_secret\": \"src_client_secret_UfwvW2WHpZ0s3QEn9g5x7waU\",   \"created\": 1445277809,   \"currency\": \"eur\",   \"flow\": \"redirect\",   \"livemode\": true,   \"owner\": {`\n\n### Source creation in mobile applications![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nIf you’re building an iOS or Android app, you can implement sources using our mobile SDKs. Refer to our sources documentation for [iOS](https://docs.stripe.com/mobile/ios/sources) or [Android](https://docs.stripe.com/mobile/android/sources) to learn more.\n\n### Optional: Providing a custom statement descriptor ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\niDEAL requires a [statement descriptor](https://support.stripe.com/questions/when-i-charge-a-customer-what-will-they-see-on-their-card-statements) before the customer is redirected to authenticate the payment. By default, your Stripe account’s statement descriptor is used (you can review this in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/public)). You can provide a custom descriptor by specifying `statement_descriptor` when creating a source.\n\n`stripe.createSource({   type: 'ideal',   amount: 1099,   currency: 'eur',   statement_descriptor: 'ORDER AT11990',   owner: {     name: 'Jenny Rosen',   },   redirect: {     return_url: '__TOKEN_PLACEHOLDER_0__',   }, }).then(function(result) {   // handle result.error or result.source });`\n\nProviding a custom statement descriptor within a subsequent charge request has no effect.\n\n### Optional: Specifying the customer’s bank ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nWhen your customer is redirected, they are first presented with a page to select which bank they use and complete authentication. If you already know which bank your customer uses for iDEAL payments, or request this during the checkout process, you can optionally provide the `ideal[bank]` parameter when creating a source and one of the following values. This allows your customer to be immediately redirected to their bank. The supported values for `ideal[bank]` are:\n\n| Bank name | Value |\n| --- | --- |\n| ABN AMRO | `abn_amro` |\n| ASN Bank | `asn_bank` |\n| Bunq | `bunq` |\n| ING | `ing` |\n| Knab | `knab` |\n| N26 | `n26` |\n| Nationale-Nederlanden | `nn` |\n| Rabobank | `rabobank` |\n| Revolut | `revolut` |\n| RegioBank | `regiobank` |\n| SNS Bank (De Volksbank) | `sns_bank` |\n| Triodos Bank | `triodos_bank` |\n| Van Lanschot | `van_lanschot` |\n| Yoursafe | `yoursafe` |\n\n### Error codes![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nSource creation for iDEAL payments may return any of the following errors:\n\n| Error | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `payment_method_not_available` | The payment method is currently not available. You should invite your customer to fallback to another payment method to proceed. |\n| `processing_error` | An unexpected error occurred preventing us from creating the source. The source creation should be retried. |\n| `invalid_ideal_bank` | The iDEAL bank parameter is invalid. It must be one of the values provided above. |\n\n[\n\n## Have the customer authorize the payment![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n\n\n](#customer-action)\n\nWhen creating a source, its status is initially set to `pending` and cannot yet be used to make a charge request. Your customer must authorize an iDEAL payment to make the source chargeable. To allow your customer to authorize the payment, redirect them to the URL provided within the`redirect[url]` attribute of the `Source` object.\n\nAfter the authorization process, your customer is redirected back to the URL provided as a value of `redirect[return_url]`. This happens regardless of whether authorization was successful or not. If the customer has authorized the payment, the `Source` object’s status will transition to `chargeable` when it is ready to be used in a charge request. If your customer declines the payment, the status will transition to `failed`.\n\nStripe populates the `redirect[return_url]` with the following GET parameters when returning your customer to your website:\n\n*   `source`: a string representing the original ID of the `Source` object\n*   `livemode`: indicates if this is a live payment, either `true` or `false`\n*   `client_secret`: used to confirm that the returning customer is the same one who triggered the creation of the source (source IDs are not considered secret)\n\nYou may include any other GET parameters you may need when specifying `redirect[return_url]`. Do not use the above as parameter names yourself as these would be overridden with the values we populate.\n\n### Mobile applications![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nTo integrate iDEAL within a mobile application, provide your application URI scheme as the `redirect[return_url]` value. By doing so, your customers are returned to your app after completing authorization. Refer to our Sources documentation for [iOS](https://docs.stripe.com/mobile/ios/sources) or [Android](https://docs.stripe.com/mobile/android/sources) to learn more.\n\nIf you are integrating without using our mobile SDKs, the redirect URL must be opened using the device’s native browser. The use of in-app web views and containers is prohibited by iDEAL and can prevent your customer from completing authentication—resulting in a lower conversion rate.\n\n### Testing the redirect process![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nWhen creating a `Source` object using your test API keys, you can follow the URL returned in the `redirect[url]` field. This leads to a Stripe page that displays information about the API request, and where you can either authorize or cancel the payment. Authorizing the payment redirects you to the URL specified in `redirect[return_url]`.\n\nAlternatively, to accelerate testing, use the following value for `owner[email]`, where `xxx_` is any prefix of your choice (these patterns are significant only in testmode):\n\n| Email Address | Effect |\n| --- | --- |\n| `xxx_chargeable@example.com` | The source will be created as `pending`, but automatically transition to `chargeable` within seconds of its creation. |\n\n[\n\n## Charge the Source![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n\n\n](#charge-request)\n\nOnce the customer has authenticated the payment, the source’s `status` transitions to `chargeable` and it can be used to make a charge request. This transition happens asynchronously and may occur after the customer was redirected back to your website.\n\nSome customers using iDEAL assume that the order process is complete once they have authenticated the payment and received confirmation from their bank. This results in customers who close their browser instead of following the redirect and returning to your app or website.\n\nFor these reasons it is essential that your integration rely on [webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks \"webhook\") to determine when the source becomes chargeable in order to create a charge. Please refer to our [best practices](https://docs.stripe.com/sources/best-practices) for more details on how to best integrate payment methods using webhooks.\n\n### Webhooks![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe following webhook events are sent to notify you about changes to the source’s status:\n\n| Event | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `source.chargeable` | A `Source` object becomes `chargeable` after a customer has authenticated and verified a payment. |\n| `source.failed` | A `Source` object failed to become chargeable as your customer declined to authenticate the payment. |\n| `source.canceled` | A `Source` object expired and cannot be used to create a charge. |\n\n### Make a charge request using the source![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nOnce the source is chargeable, from your `source.chargeable` webhook handler, you can make a charge request using the source ID as the value for the `source` parameter to complete the payment.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/charges \\   -u` \n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`: \\   -d amount=\"1099\" \\   -d currency=\"eur\" \\   -d source=src_18eYalAHEMiOZZp1l9ZTjSU0`\n\niDEAL Sources are [single-use](https://docs.stripe.com/sources#single-use-or-reusable) and cannot be used for recurring or additional payments.\n\nRefer to our [Sources & Customers](https://docs.stripe.com/sources/customers) guide for more information on how single-use Sources interact with [Customers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers \"Customers\").\n\n[\n\n## Confirm that the charge has succeeded![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n\n\n](#charge-confirmation)\n\nSince iDEAL is a [synchronous](https://docs.stripe.com/sources#synchronous-or-asynchronous-confirmation) payment method and the customer has already authenticated the payment as part of the redirect, unless there is an unexpected error, the [Charge](https://docs.stripe.com/api#charge_object) will immediately succeed.\n\nYou will also receive the following webhook event as the charge is created:\n\n| Event | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `charge.succeeded` | The charge succeeded and the payment is complete. |\n\nWe recommend that you rely on the `charge.succeeded` webhook event to notify your customer that the payment process has been completed and their order is confirmed. Please refer to our [best practices](https://docs.stripe.com/sources/best-practices) for more details on how to best integrate payment methods using webhooks.\n\n### Disputed payments![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe risk of fraud or unrecognized payments is extremely low with iDEAL as the customer must authenticate the payment with their bank. As such, there is no dispute process that can result in a chargeback and funds withdrawn from your Stripe account.\n\n### Refunds![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nPayments made with iDEAL can only be submitted for refund within 180 days from the date of the original charge. After 180 days, it is no longer possible to refund the charge.\n\n### Sources expiration![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nA source must be used within six hours of becoming `chargeable`. If it is not, its status is automatically transitioned to `canceled` and your integration receives a `source.canceled` webhook event. Additionally, `pending` sources are canceled after one hour if they are not used to authenticate a payment.\n\nOnce a source is canceled, the customer’s authenticated payment is refunded automatically—no money is moved into your account. For this reason, make sure the order is canceled on your end and the customer is notified once you receive the `source.canceled` event.",

  "markdown": "# Saving cards using MOTO | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\nYou’re responsible for your compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, and network rules when saving a customer’s payment details. For example, the European Data Protection Board has issued guidance regarding saving payment details. These requirements generally apply if you want to save your customer’s payment method for future use, such as presenting a customer’s payment method to them in the checkout flow for a future purchase or charging them when they’re not actively using your website or app.\n\nAdd terms to your website or app that state how you plan to save payment method details and allow customers to opt in. If you plan to charge the customer while they’re offline, then at a minimum, make sure that your terms also cover the following:\n\n*   The customer’s agreement to your initiating a payment or a series of payments on their behalf for specified transactions.\n*   The anticipated timing and frequency of payments (for instance, whether charges are for scheduled installment or subscription payments, or for unscheduled top-ups).\n*   How the payment amount is determined.\n*   Your cancellation policy, if you’re setting up the payment method for a subscription service.\n\nMake sure you keep a record of your customer’s written agreement to these terms.\n\nWhen you save a payment method, it can only be used for the specific usage that you included in your terms. If you want to charge customers when they’re offline and also save the customer’s payment method to present to them as a saved payment method for future purchases, you must explicitly collect consent from the customer. One way to do so is with a “Save my payment method for future use” checkbox.",

You can then follow the instructions below to deploy your app.\n\nDuring deployment, your app is immediately sent and downloaded to your device. The device reboots to install the app. Devices reboot every 24 hours and apply any updates automatically. To check for and apply updates immediately, you can manually reboot your device.\n\n## Add or edit a deploy group ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nBefore you can add or edit a deploy group, you must create a Terminal [location](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/fleet/locations-and-zones) and add [readers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/object) to that location.\n\nAfter you create a deploy group, you can edit it at any time by clicking **edit** next to the location.\n\n1.  In the Dashboard, click **Developers** > **Apps**.\n2.  On the [Terminal apps](https://dashboard.stripe.com/terminal/apps_on_devices/apps) tab, click **Manage deploy groups**.\n3.  Click **Add deploy group**.\n4.  Complete the following steps in the **Deploy group** window:\n    *   Enter a group name.\n    *   Choose your Terminal device type.\n    *   Choose the location(s) to add.\n    *   Click **Done**.\n\n## Deploy an app version ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nYou can deploy your app after a [Stripe reviewer approves](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/features/apps-on-devices/app-review) it.\n\n1.  On the [Terminal apps](https://dashboard.stripe.com/terminal/apps_on_devices/apps) tab, choose the app that you want to deploy.\n2.  On the app details page, click **Deploy version**.\n3.  Choose a version of the approved app, then click **Next**. You can’t deploy an earlier version of an app. The app version must be newer than the currently deployed app.\n4.  Choose the deploy group, then click **Next**.\n5.  Choose your preferred kiosk app, then click **Next**. This is the default app that launches when the Stripe reader turns on. If there’s only one app to deploy, choose that app instead.\n6.  Confirm the deployment details, then click **Deploy**. The app deploys immediately.\n\n## Deploy group best practices![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYou can sort devices into different deploy groups to roll out software independently and isolate fault in case of any issues. You might have fewer or more deploy groups based on tooling, risk tolerance, and specific business needs.\n\nWe recommend the following deploy group setup:\n\n*   **Alpha** - Contains locations that correspond to your internal devkits or internal production devices.\n*   **Beta** - Contains a small number of actual user locations. You can randomly choose these locations, select them based on meaningful criteria (for example, less risky locations), or have users opt in to the Beta deploy group based on their risk tolerance.\n*   **General** - Contains all remaining actual user locations, except those in the Alpha or Beta groups.\n\nWhen your app is ready for deployment, promote deploy groups from least to most risky:\n\n|     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1   | Alpha | First, deploy to the Alpha deploy group to test your app in a way that minimizes risk to users. Discovering a bug or undesirable behavior at this stage only affects a small number of internal devices, rather than actual users and real payments. |\n| 2   | Beta | Second, deploy to the Beta deploy group. This balances exposing your app to real users and not exposing all users to potential issues. |\n| 3   | General | Finally, deploy to the General deploy group after addressing any issues or confirming that no issues existed for the Beta deploy group. |",

It contains analytics and charts that provide information about the performance of your business. Home also shows recent activity that might require you to take action, such as unanswered disputes or identity verifications.\n\n## Navigate the Dashboard ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nThe Dashboard is organized by the most common workflows used to manage your business. For example, the [Payments](https://dashboard.stripe.com/payments) tab allows you to manage the flow of money in and out of your account.\n\nIn many cases, you can use the Dashboard to perform specific actions, such as refunding a payment or canceling a [subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/creating \"subscriptions\") without needing to use the API. You can access configuration options and settings from the [Dashboard settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings).\n\n#### Keyboard shortcuts\n\nThe Dashboard supports keyboard shortcuts for common actions. Press **?** on your keyboard on any page in the Dashboard for a list of available shortcuts.\n\n## Team member access ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nYou can invite [team members](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/teams) to access the Dashboard and help manage your business. Each of them can have different levels of access. For instance, you can allow members of your customer service team to access your Dashboard for the purpose of handling [refunds](https://docs.stripe.com/refunds) and [dispute responses](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/responding#respond).\n\n## Monitor your integration ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nThe [Developers Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/developers) provides you with information about the performance and health of your integration.

Each log contains details about the original request, whether it succeeded or failed, the response from Stripe, and a reference to any related API resources.\n\nYou can also review every [event](https://docs.stripe.com/api#events) that takes place on your account in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/events). Events represent a change to an API resource (for example, when you update or create a [Charge](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/object) object), and contain its current information.\n\n## Reporting and searching ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nYou can filter and export all of your transactional data as [reports](https://docs.stripe.com/reports) in CSV format. You can also download a monthly report or [QuickBooks-formatted export](https://docs.stripe.com/reports/quickbooks) from your account’s business settings.\n\nYou can use [Dashboard search](https://docs.stripe.com/dashboard/search) to find specific information using different terms and operators to narrow down the number of results.

For demonstration purposes, we’ll build a home-rental marketplace that connects homeowners to potential tenants. We’ll also show you how to accept payments from tenants (customers) and pay out homeowners (your platform’s users).\n\n## Prerequisites![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n1.  [Register your platform](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/tasklist).\n2.  Add business details to [activate your account](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/onboarding).\n3.  [Complete your platform profile](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/settings/profile).\n4.  [Customize your brand settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect/stripe-dashboard/branding). Add a business name, icon, and brand color.\n\n[](#setup)\n\nInstall Stripe’s official libraries to access the API from your application:\n\n`# Available as a gem sudo gem install stripe`\n\n`# If you use bundler, you can add this line to your Gemfile gem 'stripe'`\n\n[](#create-account)\n\nWhen a user (seller or service provider) signs up on your marketplace, you must create a corresponding user [Account](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts) (referred to as a _connected account_). You can’t accept payments and move funds to the bank account of your user without a connected account. Connected accounts represent your users in the Stripe API and collect the information required to verify the user’s identity. In our home-rental example, the connected account represents the homeowner.\n\n### Create a connected account and prefill information ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nUse the `/v1/accounts` API to [create](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/create) a connected account by specifying the [connected account properties](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/migrate-to-controller-properties), or by specifying the account type.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/accounts \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d \"controller[losses][payments]\"=application \\  -d \"controller[fees][payer]\"=application \\  -d \"controller[stripe_dashboard][type]\"=express`\n\nIf you’ve already collected information for your connected accounts, you can prefill that information on the account object. You can prefill any account information, including personal and business information, external account information, and so on.\n\nConnect Onboarding doesn’t ask for the prefilled information. However, it does ask the account holder to confirm the prefilled information before accepting the [Connect service agreement](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/service-agreement-types).\n\nWhen testing your integration, prefill account information using [test data](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/testing).\n\n### Create an account link ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nYou can create an account link by calling the [Account Links](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_links) API with the following parameters:\n\n*   `account`\n*   `refresh_url`\n*   `return_url`\n*   `type` = `account_onboarding`\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/account_links \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d account=  {{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}   \\   --data-urlencode refresh_url=\"[https://example.com/reauth](https://example.com/reauth)\" \\   --data-urlencode return_url=\"[https://example.com/return](https://example.com/return)\" \\  -d type=account_onboarding`\n\n### Redirect your user to the account link URL ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nThe response to your [Account Links](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_links) request includes a value for the key `url`. Redirect to this link to send your user into the flow. URLs from the [Account Links](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_links) API are temporary and are single-use only, because they grant access to the connected account user’s personal information. Authenticate the user in your application before redirecting them to this URL. If you want to prefill information, you must do so before generating the account link. After you create the account link, you can’t read or write information for the connected account.\n\n#### Security tip\n\nDon’t email, text, or otherwise send account link URLs outside of your platform application. Instead, provide them to the authenticated account holder within your application.\n\n### Handle the user returning to your platform ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nConnect Onboarding requires you to pass both a `return_url` and `refresh_url` to handle all cases where the user is redirected to your platform. It’s important that you implement these correctly to provide the best experience for your user.\n\n#### Note\n\nYou can use HTTP for your `return_url` and `refresh_url` while in test mode (for example, to test with localhost), but live mode only accepts HTTPS. Be sure to swap testing URLs for HTTPS URLs before going live.\n\n#### return\\_url![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nStripe issues a redirect to this URL when the user completes the Connect Onboarding flow. This doesn’t mean that all information has been collected or that there are no outstanding requirements on the account. This only means the flow was entered and exited properly.\n\nNo state is passed through this URL. After a user is redirected to your `return_url`, check the state of the `details_submitted` parameter on their account by doing either of the following:\n\n*   Listening to `account.updated` webhooks\n*   Calling the [Accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts) API and inspecting the returned object\n\n#### refresh\\_url![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nStripe redirects your user to the `refresh_url` in these cases:\n\n*   The link is expired (a few minutes went by since the link was created).\n*   The user already visited the URL (the user refreshed the page or clicked back or forward in the browser).\n*   Your platform is no longer able to access the account.\n*   The account has been rejected.\n\nYour `refresh_url` should trigger a method on your server to call [Account Links](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_links) again with the same parameters, and redirect the user to the Connect Onboarding flow to create a seamless experience.\n\n### Handle users that haven’t completed onboarding ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nA user that’s redirected to your `return_url` might not have completed the onboarding process. Use the `/v1/accounts` endpoint to retrieve the user’s account and check for `charges_enabled`. If the account isn’t fully onboarded, provide UI prompts to allow the user to continue onboarding later. The user can complete their account activation through a new account link (generated by your integration). You can check the state of the `details_submitted` parameter on their account to see if they’ve completed the onboarding process.\n\n[](#enable-payment-methods)\n\nView your [payment methods settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) and enable the payment methods you want to support. Card payments, Google Pay, and Apple Pay are enabled by default but you can enable and disable payment methods as needed.\n\nBefore the payment form is displayed, Stripe evaluates the currency, payment method restrictions, and other parameters to determine the list of supported payment methods. Payment methods that increase conversion and that are most relevant to the currency and customer’s location are prioritized. Lower priority payment methods are hidden in an overflow menu.\n\n[](#accept-payment)\n\nUse [Stripe Checkout](https://stripe.com/payments/checkout) to accept payments. Checkout supports multiple payment methods and automatically shows the most relevant ones to your customer. You can accept payments with Checkout using a Stripe-hosted page or add a prebuilt embeddable payment form directly in your website. You can also create a custom flow (using Payment Element) to accept multiple payment methods with a single front-end integration.\n\n### Create a Checkout Session Client and Server ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nA Checkout Session controls what your customer sees in the Stripe-hosted payment page such as line items, the order amount and currency, and acceptable payment methods.\n\nAdd a checkout button to your website that calls a server-side endpoint to create a Checkout Session.\n\n`<html>   <head>     <title>Checkout</title>   </head>   <body>     <form action=\"/create-checkout-session\" method=\"POST\">       <button type=\"submit\">Checkout</button>     </form>   </body> </html>`\n\nOn your server, make the following call to Stripe’s API. After creating a Checkout Session, redirect your customer to the [URL](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/object#checkout_session_object-url) returned in the response.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/checkout/sessions \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d mode=payment \\  -d \"line_items[0][price]\"=  {{PRICE_ID}}   \\  -d \"line_items[0][quantity]\"=1 \\  -d \"payment_intent_data[application_fee_amount]\"=123 \\  -d \"payment_intent_data[transfer_data][destination]\"=  {{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}   \\   --data-urlencode success_url=\"[https://example.com/success](https://example.com/success)\" \\   --data-urlencode cancel_url=\"[https://example.com/cancel](https://example.com/cancel)\"`\n\n*   `line_items` - This argument represents the items the customer is purchasing. The items are displayed in the Stripe-hosted user interface.\n*   `success_url` - This argument redirects a user after they complete a payment.\n*   `cancel_url` - This argument redirects a user after they click cancel.\n*   `payment_intent_data[application_fee_amount]` - This argument specifies the amount your platform plans to take from the transaction. The full charge amount is immediately transferred from the platform to the connected account that’s specified by `transfer_data[destination]` after the charge is captured. The `application_fee_amount` is then transferred back to the platform, and the Stripe fee is deducted from the platform’s amount.\n*   `payment_intent_data[transfer_data][destination]` - This argument indicates that this is a [destination charge](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges). A destination charge means the charge is processed on the platform and then the funds are immediately and automatically transferred to the connected account’s pending balance. For our home-rental example, we want to build an experience where the customer pays through the platform and the homeowner gets paid by the platform.\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/application_fee_amount.837aa2339469b3c1a4319672971c1367.svg)\n\nCheckout uses the brand settings of your platform account for destination charges. For more information, see [Customize branding](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges?platform=web&ui=stripe-hosted#branding).\n\nThis Session creates a destination charge. If you need to control the timing of transfers or need to transfer funds from a single payment to multiple parties, use separate charges and transfers instead. To use separate charges, see [Enable other businesses to accept payments directly](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/enable-payment-acceptance-guide?platform=web).\n\n### Handle post-payment events Server-side![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nStripe sends a [checkout.session.completed](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-checkout.session.completed) event when the payment completes. [Use a webhook to receive these events](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks/quickstart) and run actions, like sending an order confirmation email to your customer, logging the sale in a database, or starting a shipping workflow.\n\nListen for these events rather than waiting on a callback from the client. On the client, the customer could close the browser window or quit the app before the callback executes. Some payment methods also take 2-14 days for payment confirmation. Setting up your integration to listen for asynchronous events enables you to accept multiple [payment methods](https://stripe.com/payments/payment-methods-guide) with a single integration.\n\nIn addition to handling the `checkout.session.completed` event, we recommend handling two other events when collecting payments with Checkout:\n\nThese events all include the [Checkout Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions) object. After the payment succeeds, the underlying [PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents \"Payment Intents API\") status changes from `processing` to `succeeded`.\n\n[](#testing)\n\nTest your account creation flow by [creating accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/testing#creating-accounts) and [using OAuth](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/testing#using-oauth).\n\n| Card number | Scenario | How to test |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|     | The card payment succeeds and doesn’t require authentication. | Fill out the credit card form using the credit card number with any expiration, CVC, and postal code. |\n|     | The card payment requires [authentication](https://docs.stripe.com/strong-customer-authentication \"Strong Customer Authentication\"). | Fill out the credit card form using the credit card number with any expiration, CVC, and postal code. |\n|     | The card is declined with a decline code like `insufficient_funds`. | Fill out the credit card form using the credit card number with any expiration, CVC, and postal code. |\n|     | The UnionPay card has a variable length of 13-19 digits. | Fill out the credit card form using the credit card number with any expiration, CVC, and postal code. |\n\nSee [Testing](https://docs.stripe.com/testing) for additional information to test your integration.\n\nAs the [settlement merchant](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges#settlement-merchant) on charges, your platform is responsible for disputes. Make sure you understand the [best practices](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/responding) for responding to disputes.\n\nBy default, any funds that you transfer to a connected account accumulate in the connected account’s [Stripe balance](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-balances) and are paid out on a daily rolling basis. You can change the [payout](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts \"payout\") frequency by going into the connected account’s detail page, clicking the right-most button in the **Balance** section, and selecting **Edit payout schedule**.\n\nTo issue refunds, go to the [Payments](https://dashboard.stripe.com/payments) page. Select individual payments by clicking the checkbox to the left of any payments you want to refund. After you select a payment, Stripe displays a **Refund** button in the upper-right corner of the page. Click the **Refund** button to issue a refund to customers for all payments you have selected.",

You can use SetupAttempts to inspect details of a specific attempt at setting up a payment method using a SetupIntent.\n\n## [Confirmation Token](https://docs.stripe.com/api/confirmation_tokens)\n\nConfirmationTokens help transport client side data collected by Stripe JS over to your server for confirming a PaymentIntent or SetupIntent. If the confirmation is successful, values present on the ConfirmationToken are written onto the Intent.\n\nTo learn more about how to use ConfirmationToken, visit the related guides:\n\n*   [Finalize payments on the server](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/finalize-payments-on-the-server)\n*   [Build two-step confirmation](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/build-a-two-step-confirmation).\n\n## [Tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens)\n\nTokenization is the process Stripe uses to collect sensitive card or bank account details, or personally identifiable information (PII), directly from your customers in a secure manner. A token representing this information is returned to your server to use. Use our [recommended payments integrations](https://docs.stripe.com/payments) to perform this process on the client-side. This guarantees that no sensitive card data touches your server, and allows your integration to operate in a PCI-compliant way.\n\nIf you can’t use client-side tokenization, you can also create tokens using the API with either your publishable or secret API key. If your integration uses this method, you’re responsible for any PCI compliance that it might require, and you must keep your secret API key safe. Unlike with client-side tokenization, your customer’s information isn’t sent directly to Stripe, so we can’t determine how it’s handled or stored.\n\nYou can’t store or use tokens more than once. To store card or bank account information for later use, create [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api#customers) objects or [External accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/api#external_accounts). [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar), our integrated solution for automatic fraud protection, performs best with integrations that use client-side tokenization.\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_account)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_bank_account)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_card)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_cvc_update)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_person)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_pii)[GET/v1/tokens/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/retrieve)\n\n## [Cash Balance](https://docs.stripe.com/api/cash_balance)\n\nA customer’s `Cash balance` represents real funds. Customers can add funds to their cash balance by sending a bank transfer. These funds can be used for payment and can eventually be paid out to your bank account.\n\n## [Customer Portal Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customer_portal/sessions)\n\nThe Billing customer portal is a Stripe-hosted UI for subscription and billing management.\n\nA portal configuration describes the functionality and features that you want to provide to your customers through the portal.\n\nA portal session describes the instantiation of the customer portal for a particular customer. By visiting the session’s URL, the customer can manage their subscriptions and billing details. For security reasons, sessions are short-lived and will expire if the customer does not visit the URL. Create sessions on-demand when customers intend to manage their subscriptions and billing details.\n\nRelated guide: [Customer management](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management)\n\n## [Invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices)\n\nInvoices are statements of amounts owed by a customer, and are either generated one-off, or generated periodically from a subscription.\n\nThey contain [invoice items](#invoiceitems), and proration adjustments that may be caused by subscription upgrades/downgrades (if necessary).\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed through automatic charges, Stripe automatically finalizes your invoice and attempts payment. Note that finalizing the invoice, [when automatic](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/automatic-advancement-collection), does not happen immediately as the invoice is created. Stripe waits until one hour after the last webhook was successfully sent (or the last webhook timed out after failing). If you (and the platforms you may have connected to) have no webhooks configured, Stripe waits one hour after creation to finalize the invoice.\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed by sending an email, then based on your [email settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/billing/automatic), Stripe will email the invoice to your customer and await payment. These emails can contain a link to a hosted page to pay the invoice.\n\nStripe applies any customer credit on the account before determining the amount due for the invoice (i.e., the amount that will be actually charged). If the amount due for the invoice is less than Stripe’s [minimum allowed charge per currency](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts), the invoice is automatically marked paid, and we add the amount due to the customer’s credit balance which is applied to the next invoice.\n\nMore details on the customer’s credit balance are [here](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/customer/balance).\n\nRelated guide: [Send invoices to customers](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/invoices/sending)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create)[POST/v1/invoices/create\\_preview](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create_preview)[POST/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/lines/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_line)[GET/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/retrieve)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming)[GET/v1/invoices/:id/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming_invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/list)[DELETE/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/delete)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/add\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/add_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/remove\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/remove_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/update\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/finalize](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/finalize)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/mark\\_uncollectible](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/mark_uncollectible)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/pay](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/pay)[GET/v1/invoices/search](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/search)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/send](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/send)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/void](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/void)\n\n## [Meter Events](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event)\n\nA billing meter event represents a customer’s usage of a product. Meter events are used to bill a customer based on their usage. Meter events are associated with billing meters, which define the shape of the event’s payload and how those events are aggregated for billing.\n\n## [Meter Event Adjustment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_adjustment)\n\nA billing meter event adjustment is a resource that allows you to cancel a meter event. For example, you might create a billing meter event adjustment to cancel a meter event that was created in error or attached to the wrong customer.\n\n## [Meter Event Summary](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_summary)\n\nA billing meter event summary represents an aggregated view of a customer’s billing meter events within a specified timeframe. It indicates how much usage was accrued by a customer for that period.\n\n## [Plans](https://docs.stripe.com/api/plans)\n\nYou can now model subscriptions more flexibly using the [Prices API](#prices). It replaces the Plans API and is backwards compatible to simplify your migration.\n\nPlans define the base price, currency, and billing cycle for recurring purchases of products. [Products](#products) help you track inventory or provisioning, and plans help you track pricing. Different physical goods or levels of service should be represented by products, and pricing options should be represented by plans. This approach lets you change prices without having to change your provisioning scheme.\n\nFor example, you might have a single “gold” product that has plans for $10/month, $100/year, €9/month, and €90/year.\n\nRelated guides: [Set up a subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/set-up-subscription) and more about [products and prices](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/overview).\n\n## [Tax IDs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_create)[POST/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/create)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_retrieve)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/retrieve)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_list)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/list)[DELETE/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_delete)[DELETE/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/delete)\n\n## [Account Links](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_links)\n\nAccount Links are the means by which a Connect platform grants a connected account permission to access Stripe-hosted applications, such as Connect Onboarding.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect Onboarding](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom/hosted-onboarding)\n\n## [Account Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_sessions)\n\nAn AccountSession allows a Connect platform to grant access to a connected account in Connect embedded components.\n\nWe recommend that you create an AccountSession each time you need to display an embedded component to your user. Do not save AccountSessions to your database as they expire relatively quickly, and cannot be used more than once.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect embedded components](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-connect-embedded-components)\n\n## [Application Fees](https://docs.stripe.com/api/application_fees)\n\nWhen you collect a transaction fee on top of a charge made for your user (using [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)), an `Application Fee` object is created in your account. You can list, retrieve, and refund application fees.\n\nRelated guide: [Collecting application fees](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges#collect-fees)\n\n## [Country Specs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/country_specs)\n\nStripe needs to collect certain pieces of information about each account created. These requirements can differ depending on the account’s country. The Country Specs API makes these rules available to your integration.\n\nYou can also view the information from this API call as [an online guide](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information).\n\n## [Person](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/create)[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/update)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/retrieve)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/list)[DELETE/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/delete)\n\n## [Transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/transfers)\n\nA `Transfer` object is created when you move funds between Stripe accounts as part of Connect.\n\nBefore April 6, 2017, transfers also represented movement of funds from a Stripe account to a card or bank account. This behavior has since been split out into a [Payout](#payout_object) object, with corresponding payout endpoints. For more information, read about the [transfer/payout split](https://docs.stripe.com/transfer-payout-split).\n\nRelated guide: [Creating separate charges and transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n\n## [Secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/secret_management)\n\nSecret Store is an API that allows Stripe Apps developers to securely persist secrets for use by UI Extensions and app backends.\n\nThe primary resource in Secret Store is a `secret`. Other apps can’t view secrets created by an app. Additionally, secrets are scoped to provide further permission control.\n\nAll Dashboard users and the app backend share `account` scoped secrets.

  "markdown": "# Reporting and reconciliation | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Use Stripe to generate financial reports and perform reconciliation.\n\nLearn about the different payout types, balance transactions, and the advanced reporting features within the Sigma platform.\n\n## Reporting and payouts![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nTo simplify reporting and reconciliation, use automatic [payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts \"payout\"), because they maintain the association between each transaction and the payout they’re included in.\n\nIf you’re building custom reporting using the APIs, use the [balance transaction endpoint](https://docs.stripe.com/api/balance_transactions/list) and the `payout` parameter to list all transactions included in an automatic payout. A best practice is to retrieve payouts automatically and asynchronously when the [payout.paid](https://docs.stripe.com/api#event_types-payout.paid) or [payout.reconciliation\\_completed](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-payout.reconciliation_completed) event is received by your [webhook](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/webhooks) handler.\n\nThe number of balance transactions can exceed the maximum limit. In that case, we recommend using the [auto pagination feature](https://docs.stripe.com/api/pagination/auto) to fetch the list of all balance transactions without having to manually paginate results and perform subsequent requests.\n\nHere’s an example balance history API call to retrieve transactions from a payout:\n\n`curl -G https://api.stripe.com/v1/balance_transactions \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d payout=  {{PAYOUT_ID}}   \\  -d limit=100`\n\nAutomatic payouts supports [Instant Payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts#instant-payouts) that instantly send funds to a supported debit card. You can request Instant Payouts 24/7, including weekends and holidays, and funds typically appear in the associated bank account within 30 minutes. See the [Instant Payout documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts/instant-payouts-banks) to see if it is available in your region.\n\n### Manual payouts![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYou can use [manual payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/payouts-connected-accounts) if desired. However, Stripe does not support transaction-level reporting for the funds that comprise your manual payouts because you specify the amount you want to get paid out.\n\nHere’s an example manual payout on your account:\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/payouts \\   -u` \n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`: \\   -X \"POST\" \\   -d \"amount\"=1000 \\   -d \"currency\"=\"usd\"`\n\n## Financial Reports![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nStripe supports many out-of-the-box [reports](https://docs.stripe.com/reports) for financial analysis:\n\n*   [Balance](https://docs.stripe.com/reports/balance): You can view and download summarized and itemized balance transaction data, helping you to close books on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis. These reports help you understand changes to your Stripe balance.\n*   [Reconciliation](https://docs.stripe.com/reports/payout-reconciliation): You can see which transactions have already been paid out and which ones are yet to be paid out using this report. The Reconciliation tab displays the same type of data you see in the Balance tab but grouped in different ways to help you reconcile payouts.\n\nAll reports are available in the Stripe Dashboard, and with the API. You can programmatically request and download any of Stripe’s prebuilt reports using the [Reporting API](https://docs.stripe.com/reports/api).\n\nTo fully automate this process, follow our [four-step integration pattern](https://docs.stripe.com/reports/api#integration-pattern), which includes listening for events that tell you when new reporting data becomes available and running your reports at that time.\n\nHere’s an example API call to generate a “Itemized payout reconciliation report for a single payout” (aka “Settlement file”). Make this API call after you’ve been notified that new data is available:\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/reporting/report_runs \\   -u` \n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`: \\   -X \"POST\" \\   -d \"report_type\"=\"payout_reconciliation.by_id.itemized.4\" \\   -d \"parameters[interval_start]\"=1577865600 \\   -d \"parameters[interval_end]\"=1580544000`\n\n## Balance transactions![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n[Balance transactions](https://docs.stripe.com/reports/balance-transaction-types) are the building blocks of all activity on Stripe. These objects:\n\n*   Represent everything that affected your Stripe balance (credits and debits).\n*   Are automatically created by Stripe (for example, each successful PaymentIntent generates a separate BalanceTransaction object, as does each payout).\n*   Are immutable (a refund is associated with a new BalanceTransaction negating the original).\n*   Can act as your ledger (to understand your balance at any point in time, you can replay all BalanceTransactions up to that point).\n\nBalanceTransactions (`txn_***` objects) are also the basis of all of our reporting—in most reports, the line-level data point is a `txn_***` object.\n\n## Advanced reporting with Sigma![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n[Sigma](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-data) makes all of your business data available in an interactive SQL environment in the Dashboard. You can write queries that leverage its extensive schema, allowing you to create fully customized reports using information about your transactions.\n\nWith Sigma, you have the ability to export data directly to CSV, and schedule queries to deliver results by email or [webhook](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks \"webhook\"). You can generate datasets for your business intelligence tools, reconcile transactional data, and generate custom reports.\n\nTo [activate Sigma](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/get-started/sigma), navigate to **Settings > Sigma** from the Dashboard. After you activate it, data takes up to 24 hours to load and be queryable. Sigma uses standard ANSI SQL and a broad range of reporting functions. Anyone on your account with permission to view reports can write and run queries.",

This tour of the API covers key information to help you understand the APIs more deeply:\n\n*   The core concepts we use across the APIs\n*   The path a successful payment takes\n*   The objects that play a role and how to determine when they’re needed\n*   Common patterns and best practices for using those objects together\n\nUnderstanding these patterns helps you move beyond the pre-written code in Stripe tutorials. You can migrate old integrations to use more modern patterns, combine simple patterns in novel ways, and plan for future growth.\n\n[](#undefined)\n\n### Everything is an object![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nEverything in your Stripe account is an object, whether you create it with the API or not. Your balance corresponds to a [Balance](https://docs.stripe.com/api/balance) object, you track customers with [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers) objects, you store payment details in [PaymentMethod](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods) objects, and so on.\n\nEven low-code and no-code integrations produce these objects. So do actions you perform in the Dashboard. For instance, when you manually create a customer in the Dashboard, it still creates a Customer object.\n\n### Objects have lives![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nStripe integrations handle complicated processes.\n\nThe API uses a single object to track each process. You create the object at the start of the process, and after every step you can check its `status` to see what needs to happen next—This is sometimes referred to as a _state machine_.\n\nFor instance, while completing a payment, a customer might try several payment methods. If one payment method fails, a `status` of `requires_payment_method` lets you know to prompt the customer for another.\n\n### An integration is made out of cooperating objects![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nTo accept a payment, a system needs to create several core objects and manage them through several states.\n\nYour Stripe integration is a system that handles this creation and management by communicating with Stripe.\n\nSome integrations do a lot more than that: track customers, manage subscriptions, etc. But their core payment functionality still comes from the same objects and steps, with more objects added around that core.\n\n[](#payment-objects)\n\nStripe uses a variety of related objects to facilitate payments. Before you can build an integration that suits your specific needs, you must familiarize yourself with how these objects work together.\n\nCheck out this video for an overview of payment object roles and capabilities.\n\nTo learn more about Stripe’s payment integration options, see the following guides:\n\n*   [Payment Links](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links)\n*   [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout)\n*   [Subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing)\n*   [Invoicing](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing)\n*   [Payment Intents](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents)\n\n[](#path-to-a-payment)\n\nIn a modern Stripe integration, every payment uses an object called a [PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents). As its name suggests, it represents your _intent_ to collect a payment. This object tracks the steps you go through along the way to fulfilling that intent.\n\nFor instance, suppose a customer clicks a **Check out** button with a 100 USD item in their cart. They haven’t bought it yet, and they might never buy it (maybe at some point they abandon the payment flow, or their card issuer declines the payment). But clicking **Check out** indicates their _intent_ to buy—and you intend to help them. At that point, an integration creates a `PaymentIntent` object in the amount of 100 USD to track the rest of the process.\n\nThe `PaymentIntent`’s path to success goes through [several statuses](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/paymentintents/lifecycle)—here’s a simplified version:\n\n### Payment methods![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nA PaymentIntent starts with the status `requires_payment_method`. To move it forward, Stripe needs details about the customer’s payment method—either a card number or credentials for some other payment system.\n\nAn integration represents these details using an API object called a [PaymentMethod](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods). In some integrations, you write the code that creates that object and attaches it to the PaymentIntent. In others, Stripe gathers the details and does the work for you. You can also create and save a payment method for use with future PaymentIntents [using the Setup Intents API](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/setup-intents).\n\n### Confirmation![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe next status is `requires_confirmation`. In an interactive payment flow, the customer must confirm that they intend to pay—and that they intend to do it using the method they provided. In a one-time online payment, this usually happens when they click the **Pay** button.\n\nWhen the customer clicks **Pay** or otherwise confirms their intent, an integration notifies Stripe with an API call. In some integrations, you write the code that makes this call. Stripe provides drop-in UI elements, called [Stripe Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/elements), to enable this while still providing flexibility to build a custom integration. In other integrations, like a [Stripe Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout) or [Payment Links](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links) integration, Stripe makes the call and handles the next steps. There are many ways to integrate Stripe and combine different objects to handle your use case. [Learn more about integration options for online payments.](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/online-payments)\n\nIn most cases a [Charge](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges) will be created when a PaymentIntent is confirmed to represent that specific attempt to move money. The Charge might succeed or fail. If it fails the payment can be retried by confirming the PaymentIntent again, usually with new payment details. Allowing retries immediately, without the need to create a new PaymentIntent, tends to increase conversion rates.\n\n### Processing and success![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe intent’s state is now `processing`, and at this point Stripe attempts to process the payment.\n\nStripe always does this part for you—and it can have several steps. (For credit cards, these steps are part of [how cards work](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/cards/overview).) As we work through the steps, we update the intent’s state with the outcome: either `succeeded` or back to `requires_payment_method` if it fails.\n\nWhen we’re done, one last object comes into play: the [Event](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events). We use `Event` objects to represent activity. In this case, the activity might be “the charge succeeded” or “the charge failed.” In some integrations, you write custom code to respond to events using [webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks). In others, such as [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout) or [Payment Links](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links) integrations, Stripe listens for the event and provides a pre-written response.",

Some banks in certain countries require more information regarding recipient identity or transaction information for risk and compliance purposes. The receiving bank often has discretion over what they require for cross-border transactions, which can differ between banks, even within the same country.\n\nIf a seller or service provider onboards as a connected account to your platform in one of these countries, we send an email to alert your user of the possibility for additional requirements. If the receiving bank requires additional information, they should reach out to your user directly with their requirements.\n\n#### Note\n\nBanks might have special requirements in certain countries, so your user might pay additional fees for the payout. Stripe might also set a higher [minimum payout](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts#cbp-minimum-payout-amounts) threshold to account for possible fees charged by certain banks.\n\nThe list of possible requirements for the following countries isn’t exhaustive, as Stripe isn’t involved with creating these conditions. If you encounter additional requirements that aren’t listed, please notify [Stripe support](https://support.stripe.com/).\n\nPossible special requirements include:\n\n### Bangladesh![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n*   Submitting a remittance form.\n*   Providing a receipt or invoice as proof that the recipient is legitimately receiving the payment.\n*   Paying additional fees.\n\n### Japan![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n*   Visiting a bank location to submit a copy of their ID and additional paperwork, if they haven’t previously done so. Banks require a national ID card number (MyNumber) to be submitted and on file before they can receive or send international transfers.\n*   Providing a receipt or invoice as proof that the recipient is legitimately receiving the payment.\n*   Paying additional fees.\n*   Supporting payouts only to banks participating in the Foreign Exchange Yen Clearing System (FXYCS).\n\n### Serbia![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n*   Providing additional information on the purpose of the payment.\n*   Providing a receipt or invoice as proof that the recipient is legitimately receiving the payment.\n*   Submitting a remittance form.\n\n## Fund flow restrictions![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe following fund flows are generally supported in countries for cross-border payouts:\n\n*   [Separate charges and transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers) without the `on_behalf_of` parameter\n*   Top-up and transfers\n*   [Destination charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges)\n\nDirect charges and destination charges _with_ the `on_behalf_of` parameter aren’t supported.

  "markdown": "# Authorization signals | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Authorization signalsBeta\n\n## Make informed, real-time decisions with authorization signals.\n\nWe provide a set of signals at authorization that you can use to make informed decisions.\n\n## Verification data![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nFor every authorization that takes place, we compare the values provided during checkout with the ones on file. We notify you if we detect a mismatch on:\n\n*   CVV2 (or security code)\n*   Card expiration date\n*   Billing address\n*   Billing zip code\n*   PIN number (when entered)\n\n### Identify fraudulent activity![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nIdentifying a mismatch between the card details on file and those entered at checkout might help you identify fraudulent activity. For example:\n\n*   A mismatch between the billing postal code and the one provided at checkout might represent a card that’s been stolen by a fraudulent actor who’s unaware of the cardholder’s postal code and attempts to use the card to make a purchase.\n*   A mismatch between the CVV2 on file and the one entered at checkout might represent a fraudulent actor cycling through card numbers to find one that works, without knowledge of the CVV associated with it.\n\nDepending on your risk tolerance and the characteristics of the authorization, such as whether it’s in person or online, you can reject authorizations if any mismatches are identified in the verification data values.\n\n## Fraud disputability assessment![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nStripe’s fraud disputability assessment evaluates whether an authorization can be disputed in the event of fraud.\n\n### Make informed decisions based on authorization disputability![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nKnowing whether or not you can dispute an authorization in the event of fraud at the time of authorization allows you to make informed decisions. For example, consider an authorization that is otherwise classified as “medium risk”:\n\n*   If you know that you can dispute the authorization if fraud occurs, you can approve it\n*   If you know that you can’t dispute the authorization (if fraud occurs), you can decline it or only approve a lower amount than what’s requested\n\nStripe assesses disputability likelihood by comparing the characteristics of the authorization (such as whether 3DS was used or if the card was present with a chip). We make this assessment against network rules for disputes to proactively determine what would happen in the event of a dispute.\n\n### Determine the likelihood a dispute can be filed![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nTo determine the disputability likelihood of an authorization in the event of fraud, examine the [fraud\\_disputability\\_likelihood](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/object#issuing_authorization_object-fraud_disputability_likelihood) field on the `Authorization` object. This field populates with various enums that inform you about whether you can dispute the authorization. We label every authorization as `very_likely`, `neutral`, or `very_unlikely`, or `unknown`:\n\n*   When authorizations receive a score of `very_likely`, it’s highly probable that disputes filed based on these authorizations are accepted by the card network. The card network rarely rejects `very_likely` authorization disputes. When they do, it’s typically due to exceptional circumstances. These circumstances might include a card filing a fraud dispute for the second time or exceeding the allowable number of disputes for a card within a specific timeframe defined by Visa.\n*   When authorizations receive a score of `very_unlikely`, disputes are almost always automatically rejected by the card network.\n*   When authorizations receive a score of `neutral`, Stripe assesses that the dispute outcome depends on various factors. Historically, these disputes are more likely to be accepted by the card network. However, this behavior might change at any given point.\n\nLearn more about [fraud disputability likelihood](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/object#issuing_authorization_object-fraud_disputability_likelihood).\n\n## High-risk business alerts ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nUse webhook notifications to receive detailed risk assessments of the acquiring business involved in an authorization.\n\n### Make informed decisions based on risk level![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nIf you have data on the risk level of a business and the likelihood of a dispute, you can make more informed decisions about which authorizations you approve or reject. To make this assessment, Stripe evaluates all of the acquiring transaction activity for a business on Stripe Issuing, including data such as its historical dispute rate.\n\n### Determine the risk level![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nTo determine the risk level, examine the [risk\\_assessment.merchant\\_dispute\\_risk](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/object#issuing_authorization_object-risk_assessment-merchant_risk) hash field on the `Authorization` object. The following example demonstrates how to use each value.\n\n### Example responses ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nA low (normal) risk transaction:\n\n`{   \"id\": \"iauth_1CmMk2IyNTgGDVfzFKlCm0gU\",   \"object\": \"issuing.authorization\",   // ...   \"risk_assessment\": {     \"merchant_dispute_risk\": {       \"risk_level\": \"normal\",       \"dispute_rate\": 5     }   } }`\n\nA high-risk transaction:\n\n`{   \"id\": \"iauth_1CmMk2IyNTgGDVfzFKlCm0gU\",   \"object\": \"issuing.authorization\",   // ...   \"risk_assessment\": {     \"merchant_dispute_risk\": {       \"risk_level\": \"high\",       \"dispute_rate\": 47     }   } }`\n\nLearn more about [merchant dispute risk](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/object#issuing_authorization_object-risk_assessment-merchant_dispute_risk).\n\n## Card testing risk![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nCard testing is a prevalent form of fraud where fraudulent actors test stolen card numbers or cycle through primary account numbers (PANs) until they find a valid one. They use this valid PAN at a business with weak verification controls. To counteract this, Stripe assesses the likelihood of your involvement in a card testing attack, takes action on your behalf, and notifies you through the API about the severity of the incident. Additionally, we assess if any cards may have been compromised during the attack.\n\n### Make informed decisions based on card testing risk![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nStripe automatically intervenes in the most obvious card testing scenarios. We offer a balanced approach in medium-risk situations to avoid being overly conservative. These cases require careful consideration of various factors, including the authorization and cardholder details. As a result, we recommend the careful evaluation of all relevant considerations before making a decision on whether to block an authorization.\n\nWe assess card testing risk by, among other things, evaluating the frequency and intensity of “card does not exist” declines associated with a specific bank identification number (BIN) or merchant. These declines are the most definitive significant indicator because they often exhibit a noticeable increase in speed and frequency compared to regular card declines.\n\n### Determine card testing risk![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nTo determine card testing risk, examine the [risk\\_assessment.card\\_testing\\_risk](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/object#issuing_authorization_object-risk_assessment-card_testing_risk) field on the `Authorization` object. The following example demonstrates how to use each value. We also provide the following fields:\n\n*   `invalid_account_number_decline_rate_past_hour`: Stripe calculates and returns this value when a decline contains a non-existent PAN.\n*   `invalid_credentials_decline_rate_past_hour`: Stripe calculates and returns this value on declines where the PAN exists (or existed in the past), but other verifications such as the CVV, expiration, and postal code are failing.\n\n#### Example responses ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nA low risk transaction:\n\n`{   \"id\": \"iauth_1CmMk2IyNTgGDVfzFKlCm0gU\",   \"object\": \"issuing.authorization\",   // ...   \"risk_assessment\": {     \"card_testing_risk\": {       \"invalid_account_number_decline_rate_past_hour\": 5,       \"invalid_credentials_decline_rate_past_hour\": 3     }   } }`\n\nA high-risk transaction:\n\n`{   \"id\": \"iauth_1CmMk2IyNTgGDVfzFKlCm0gU\",   \"object\": \"issuing.authorization\",   // ...   \"risk_assessment\": {     \"card_testing_risk\": {       \"invalid_account_number_decline_rate_past_hour\": 79,       \"invalid_credentials_decline_rate_past_hour\": 83     }   } }`\n\nLearn more about [card testing risk](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/object#issuing_authorization_object-risk_assessment-card_testing_risk).\n\n## Recommended settings![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nTo get started, enable the following settings that align with your business needs.

  "markdown": "# Set up future card payments\n\nTo collect customer payment details that you can reuse later, use Checkout’s setup mode. Setup mode uses the [Setup Intents API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_intents) to create [Payment Methods](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods).\n\nCheck out our [full, working sample on GitHub](https://github.com/stripe-samples/checkout-remember-me-with-twilio-verify).\n\n[\n\n## Set up Stripe![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n\n\n](#set-up-stripe)\n\nFirst, you need a Stripe account. [Register now](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register).\n\nUse our official libraries to access the Stripe API from your application:\n\n`# Available as a gem sudo gem install stripe`\n\n`# If you use bundler, you can add this line to your Gemfile gem 'stripe'`\n\n[\n\n## Create a Checkout Session![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n\n\n](#create-checkout-session)\n\nAdd a checkout button to your website that calls a server-side endpoint to create a Checkout Session.\n\n`<html>   <head>     <title>Checkout</title>   </head>   <body>     <form action=\"/create-checkout-session\" method=\"POST\">       <button type=\"submit\">Checkout</button>     </form>   </body> </html>`\n\nTo create a setup mode Session, use the `mode` parameter with a value of `setup` when creating the Session. You can optionally specify the [customer parameter](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-customer) to automatically attach the created payment method to an existing customer. Checkout uses [Dynamic payment methods](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/dynamic-payment-methods) by default, which requires you to pass the [currency](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-currency) parameter when using `setup` mode.\n\nAppend the `{CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}` template variable to the `success_url` to get access to the Session ID after your customer successfully completes a Checkout Session. After creating the Checkout Session, redirect your customer to the [URL](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/object#checkout_session_object-url) returned in the response.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/checkout/sessions \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d mode=setup \\  -d currency=usd \\  -d customer={{CUSTOMER_ID}} \\   --data-urlencode success_url=\"https://example.com/success?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}\"`\n\n[\n\n## Retrieve the Checkout Session![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n\n\n](#retrieve-checkout-session)\n\nAfter a customer successfully completes their Checkout Session, you need to retrieve the Session object. There are two ways to do this:\n\n*   **Asynchronously**: Handle `checkout.session.completed` [webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks \"webhook\"), which contain a Session object. Learn more about [setting up webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks).\n*   **Synchronously**: Obtain the Session ID from the `success_url` when a user redirects back to your site. Use the Session ID to [retrieve](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/retrieve) the Session object.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/checkout/sessions/cs_test_MlZAaTXUMHjWZ7DcXjusJnDU4MxPalbtL5eYrmS2GKxqscDtpJq8QM0k \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\"`\n\nThe right choice depends on your tolerance for dropoff, as customers may not always reach the `success_url` after a successful payment. It’s possible for them close their browser tab before the redirect occurs. Handling webhooks prevents your integration from being susceptible to this form of dropoff.\n\nAfter you have retrieved the Session object, get the value of the `setup_intent` key, which is the ID for the SetupIntent created during the Checkout Session. A [SetupIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/setup-intents) is an object used to set up the customer’s bank account information for future payments.\n\nExample `checkout.session.completed` payload:\n\n`{   \"id\": \"evt_1Ep24XHssDVaQm2PpwS19Yt0\",   \"object\": \"event\",   \"api_version\": \"2019-03-14\",   \"created\": 1561420781,   \"data\": {     \"object\": {       \"id\": \"cs_test_MlZAaTXUMHjWZ7DcXjusJnDU4MxPalbtL5eYrmS2GKxqscDtpJq8QM0k\",       \"object\": \"checkout.session\",       \"billing_address_collection\": null,       \"client_reference_id\": null,       \"customer\": \"\",       \"customer_email\": null,       \"display_items\": [],       \"mode\": \"setup\",       \"setup_intent\": \"seti_1EzVO3HssDVaQm2PJjXHmLlM\",       \"submit_type\": null,       \"subscription\": null,       \"success_url\": \"[https://example.com/success](https://example.com/success)\"     }   },   \"livemode\": false,   \"pending_webhooks\": 1,   \"request\": {     \"id\": null,     \"idempotency_key\": null   },   \"type\": \"checkout.session.completed\" }`\n\nNote the `setup_intent` ID for the next step.\n\n[\n\n## Retrieve the SetupIntent![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n\n\n](#retrieve-setup-intent)\n\nUsing the `setup_intent` ID, [retrieve](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_intents/retrieve) the SetupIntent object. The returned object contains a `payment_method` ID that you can attach to a customer in the next step.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/setup_intents/seti_1EzVO3HssDVaQm2PJjXHmLlM \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\"`\n\n#### Note\n\nIf you’re requesting this information synchronously from the Stripe API (as opposed to handling webhooks), you can combine the previous step with this step by [expanding](https://docs.stripe.com/api/expanding_objects) the SetupIntent object in the request to the /v1/checkout/session endpoint. Doing this prevents you from having to make two network requests to access the newly created PaymentMethod ID.\n\n[\n\n## Use the payment method![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n\n\n](#use-payment-method)\n\nIf you didn’t create the Checkout Session with an existing customer, use the `payment_method` ID to [attach](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods/attach) the [PaymentMethod](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods \"PaymentMethods\") to a [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers \"Customers\"). After you attach the PaymentMethod to a customer, you can charge the PaymentMethod using a [PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-payment_method).\n\n[\n\n## Disclose Stripe to your customers![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n\n\n](#disclose-cookies)\n\nStripe collects information on customer interactions with Elements to provide services to you, prevent fraud, and improve its services.

  "markdown": "# Alipay payments with Sources | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Use Sources to accept payments using Alipay, a popular payment method in China.\n\n#### Warning\n\nWe deprecated the Sources API and plan to remove support for local payment methods. If you currently integrate with Alipay using the Sources API, you must [migrate to the Payment Methods API](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/transitioning). We’ll send email communication with more information about this end of support.\n\nFor information about integrating Alipay with the current APIs, see [Alipay payments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/alipay).\n\nStripe users can use [Sources](https://docs.stripe.com/sources) to accept [Alipay](https://alipay.com/) payments from customers from China.\n\nDuring the payment process, a [Source](https://docs.stripe.com/api#sources) object is created and your customer is redirected to Alipay for authorization. After completing this, your integration uses the source to make a charge request and complete the payment.\n\nAlipay is a [push](https://docs.stripe.com/sources#pull-or-push-of-funds)\\-based, [single-use](https://docs.stripe.com/sources#single-use-or-reusable) and [synchronous](https://docs.stripe.com/sources#synchronous-or-asynchronous-confirmation) method of payment. This means that your customer takes action to authorize the push of funds through a [redirect](https://docs.stripe.com/sources#flow-for-customer-action). There is immediate confirmation about the success or failure of a payment.\n\n[\n\n## Create a Source object![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n\n\n](#create-source)\n\nA `Source` object is either created client-side using [Stripe.js](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/elements) or server-side using the [Source creation endpoint](https://docs.stripe.com/api#create_source), with the following parameters:\n\n| Parameter | Value |\n| --- | --- |\n| `type` | **alipay** |\n| `currency` | cny or the default currency for your country. Accepted currencies are **aud**, **cad**, **cny**, **eur**, **gbp**, **hkd**, **jpy**, **nzd**, **sgd**, or **usd**. Users in Denmark, Norway, Sweden, or Switzerland must use **eur**. |\n| `redirect[return_url]` | The URL the customer should be redirected to after the authorization process. |\n| `amount` | A positive integer in the [smallest currency unit](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#zero-decimal) representing the amount to charge the customer (for example, **1099** for a 10.99 USD payment). |\n\nTo create a source with [Stripe.js](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/elements), first include the library within your website and set your [publishable API key](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys). Once included, use the following `createSource` method to create a source client-side:\n\n`stripe.createSource({   type: 'alipay',   amount: 1099,   currency: 'usd',   redirect: {     return_url: '__TOKEN_PLACEHOLDER_0__',   }, }).then(function(result) {   // handle result.error or result.source });`\n\nUsing either method, Stripe returns a `Source` object containing the relevant details for the method of payment used. Information specific to Alipay is provided within the `alipay` subhash.\n\n`{   \"id\": \"src_16xhynE8WzK49JbAs9M21jaR\",   \"object\": \"source\",   \"amount\": 1099,   \"client_secret\": \"src_client_secret_UfwvW2WHpZ0s3QEn9g5x7waU\",   \"created\": 1445277809,   \"currency\": \"usd\",   \"flow\": \"redirect\",   \"livemode\": true,   \"owner\": {`\n\n### Error codes ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nSource creation for Alipay payments may return any of the following errors:\n\n| Error | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `payment_method_not_available` | The payment method is currently not available. You should invite your customer to fallback to another payment method to proceed. |\n| `processing_error` | An unexpected error occurred preventing us from creating the source. The source creation should be retried. |\n\n[\n\n## Have the customer complete authorization![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n\n\n](#customer-action)\n\nWhen creating a source, its status is initially set to `pending` and cannot yet be used to make a charge request. Your customer must authorize an Alipay payment to make the source chargeable. To allow your customer to authorize the payment, redirect them to the URL provided within the`redirect[url]` attribute of the `Source` object.\n\nAfter the authorization process, your customer is redirected back to the URL provided as a value of `redirect[return_url]`. This happens regardless of whether authorization was successful or not. If the customer has authorized the payment, the `Source` object’s status will transition to `chargeable` when it is ready to be used in a charge request. If your customer declines the payment, the status will transition to `failed`.\n\nStripe populates the `redirect[return_url]` with the following GET parameters when returning your customer to your website:\n\n*   `source`: a string representing the original ID of the `Source` object\n*   `livemode`: indicates if this is a live payment, either `true` or `false`\n*   `client_secret`: used to confirm that the returning customer is the same one who triggered the creation of the source (source IDs are not considered secret)\n\nYou may include any other GET parameters you may need when specifying `redirect[return_url]`. Do not use the above as parameter names yourself as these would be overridden with the values we populate.\n\n### Mobile applications![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nTo integrate Alipay within a mobile application, provide your application URI scheme as the `redirect[return_url]` value. By doing so, your customers are returned to your app after completing authorization. Direct redirects to the Alipay app are also supported when using our native SDKs.\n\nFor Android sources, the [Alipay SDK](https://doc.open.alipay.com/doc2/detail.htm?treeId=54&articleId=104509&docType=1) is required for app-to-app support.\n\n### Testing the redirect process![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nWhen creating a `Source` object using your test API keys, you can follow the URL returned in the `redirect[url]` field. This leads to a Stripe page that displays information about the API request, and where you can either authorize or cancel the payment. Authorizing the payment redirects you to the URL specified in `redirect[return_url]`.\n\n[\n\n## Charge the Source![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n\n\n](#charge-request)\n\nOnce the customer has authorized the payment, the source’s `status` transitions to `chargeable` and it can be used to make one charge request. This transition happens asynchronously and may occur after the customer was redirected back to your website.\n\nSome customers using Alipay assume that the order process is complete once they have authorized the payment and received confirmation on Alipay’s site or app. This results in customers who close their browser instead of following the redirect and returning to your app or website.\n\nFor these reasons it is essential that your integration rely on [webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks \"webhook\") to determine when the source becomes chargeable in order to create a charge. Please refer to our [best practices](https://docs.stripe.com/sources/best-practices) for more details on how to best integrate payment methods using webhooks.\n\n### Webhooks![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe following webhook events are sent to notify you about changes to the source’s status:\n\n| Event | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `source.chargeable` | A `Source` object becomes `chargeable` after a customer has authorized and verified a payment. |\n| `source.failed` | A `Source` object failed to become chargeable as your customer declined to authorize the payment. |\n| `source.canceled` | A `Source` object expired and cannot be used to create a charge. |\n\n### Make a charge request using the source![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nOnce the source is chargeable, from your `source.chargeable` webhook handler, you can make a charge request using the source ID as the value for the `source` parameter to complete the payment.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/charges \\   -u` \n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`: \\   -d amount=\"1099\" \\   -d currency=\"eur\" \\   -d source=src_18eYalAHEMiOZZp1l9ZTjSU0`\n\nBy default, your account’s [statement descriptor](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/statement-descriptors) appears on customer statements whenever you create an Alipay payment.\n\n### Error codes ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nCharge creation for Alipay payments may return any of the following errors:\n\n| Error | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `insufficient_funds` | The Alipay account has insufficient funds to complete the purchase. The customer should fund their account and try again, or use an alternative payment method. |\n| `invalid_amount` | This occurs if the charge amount is larger than what is supported by Alipay. |\n\n[\n\n## Confirm that the charge has succeeded![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n\n\n](#charge-confirmation)\n\nSince the customer has already authorized the payment as part of the redirect, unless there is an unexpected error, the [Charge](https://docs.stripe.com/api#charge_object) will immediately succeed.\n\nYou will also receive the following webhook event as the charge is created:\n\n| Event | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `charge.succeeded` | The charge succeeded and the payment is complete. |\n\nWe recommend that you rely on the `charge.succeeded` webhook event to notify your customer that the payment process has been completed and their order is confirmed. Please refer to our [best practices](https://docs.stripe.com/sources/best-practices) for more details on how to best integrate payment methods using webhooks.\n\n## Disputed payments ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nIf a customer’s Alipay account is used illicitly, Alipay and Stripe handle the issue internally. Alipay payments are disputed only if the customer has a complaint about the provided goods or service. Should a dispute occur, a `charge.dispute.created` webhook event is sent to your webhook endpoint, and Stripe deducts the amount of the dispute from your Stripe balance.\n\n## Refunds![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nPayments made with Alipay can only be submitted for refund within 90 days from the date of the original charge. After 90 days, it is no longer possible to refund the charge.\n\n## Single-use Sources expiration![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nA single-use Alipay source must be charged within six hours of becoming `chargeable`, or before 23:45 China Standard Time (GMT+8) due to Chinese government restrictions around settlement. If it is not, its status is automatically transitioned to `canceled` and your integration receives a `source.canceled` webhook event. Once a chargeable source is canceled, the customer’s authorized Alipay payment is refunded automatically—no money is moved into your account. For this reason, make sure the order is canceled on your end and the customer is notified when you receive the `source.canceled` event.\n\nAdditionally, `pending` sources are canceled after one hour if they are not used to authorize a payment, ensuring that all sources eventually transition out of their `pending` state to the `canceled` state if they are not used.\n\n## Settlement currencies![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nAlipay supports settlement in the default currency of your account. If you have a bank account in another currency and would like to create Alipay sources in that currency, please [get in touch](https://support.stripe.com/email). Support for additional currencies is provided on a case-by-case basis.",

See our [best practices](https://docs.stripe.com/sources/best-practices) for more details on how to best integrate payment methods using webhooks.\n\n### Webhooks![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe following webhook events are sent to notify you about changes to the source’s status:\n\n| Event | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `source.chargeable` | A `Source` object becomes `chargeable` after a customer has authorized and verified a payment. |\n| `source.failed` | A `Source` object failed to become chargeable as your customer declined to authorize the payment. |\n| `source.canceled` | A `Source` object expired and cannot be used to create a charge. |\n\n### Make a charge request using the source![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nOnce the source is chargeable, from your `source.chargeable` webhook handler, you can make a charge request using the source ID as the value for the `source` parameter to complete the payment.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/charges \\   -u` \n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`: \\   -d amount=\"1099\" \\   -d currency=\"usd\" \\   -d source=src_18eYalAHEMiOZZp1l9ZTjSU0`\n\nWeChat Pay Sources are [single-use](https://docs.stripe.com/sources#single-use-or-reusable) and cannot be used for recurring or additional payments. Learn more about using [Sources with Customer objects](https://docs.stripe.com/sources/customers).\n\n[\n\n## Confirm that the charge has succeeded![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n\n\n](#charge-confirmation)\n\nSince WeChat Pay is a [synchronous](https://docs.stripe.com/sources#synchronous-or-asynchronous-confirmation) payment method and the customer has already authorized the payment using the WeChat application, the [Charge](https://docs.stripe.com/api#charge_object) will immediately succeed unless there’s an unexpected error.\n\nYou receive the following webhook event when the charge succeeds:\n\n| Event | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `charge.succeeded` | The charge succeeded and the payment is complete. |\n\nStripe recommends that you rely on the `charge.succeeded` webhook event to notify your customer that the payment process has been completed and their order is confirmed. See [best practices](https://docs.stripe.com/sources/best-practices) for more details on integrating payment methods using webhooks.\n\n### Disputed payments![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nIf a customer’s WeChat Pay account is used illicitly, WeChat Pay and Stripe handle the issue internally. In the context of WeChat Pay, payments are only disputed if the customer has a complaint about the provided goods or service. Should a dispute occur, a `charge.dispute.created` webhook event is sent, and Stripe deducts the amount of the dispute from your Stripe balance.\n\n### Refunds![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nPayments made with WeChat Pay can only be submitted for refund within 180 days from the date of the original charge. After 180 days, it is no longer possible to refund the charge.\n\n### Sources expiration![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nA WeChat Pay source must be charged within six hours of becoming `chargeable`, or before 23:45 China Standard Time (GMT+8) due to Chinese government restrictions around settlement. If it is not, its status is automatically transitioned to `canceled` and your integration receives a `source.canceled` webhook event. Once a chargeable source is canceled, the customer’s authorized WeChat Pay payment is refunded automatically—no money is moved into your account. For this reason, make sure the order is canceled on your end and the customer is notified when you receive the `source.canceled` event.\n\nAdditionally, `pending` sources are canceled after one hour if they are not used to authorize a payment, ensuring that all sources eventually transition out of their `pending` state to the `canceled` state if they are not used.",

  "markdown": "# Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\nStrong Customer Authentication (SCA) is a regulatory requirement in effect as of September 14, 2019, that impacts many European online payments. It requires customers to use two-factor authentication like 3D Secure to verify their purchase.\n\nSome transactions that are deemed low risk, based on the volume of fraud rates associated with the payment provider or bank, may be exempt from Europe’s [Strong Customer Authentication](https://docs.stripe.com/strong-customer-authentication \"Strong Customer Authentication\") requirements.\n\n#### Note\n\nIf Stripe requests an exemption for payments requiring SCA and the transaction passes through the **frictionless flow**, it doesn’t benefit from the liability shift. If an issuer applies the **frictionless flow** without being requested, liability shift generally occurs. Learn more about [liability shifts](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure/authentication-flow#disputed-payments).\n\nThe payment authentication report enables you to view the different type of exemptions being used, so you can access SCA impact, understand levels of enforcement, and see the value of the SCA exemptions requested on your behalf.\n\n![Payment authentication report](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/sca-exemptions.59b0a1bdaec8cdb06592edc3426c279d.png)\n\n**Payments in SCA scope** is the number of all transactions where you or the card issuing bank is in one of the 32 European countries with SCA regulation. It excludes payments that were retried but failed for the same order. See [When is Strong Customer Authentication required?](https://stripe.com/guides/strong-customer-authentication#when-is-strong-customer-authentication-required).\n\n**Exempted payments** is the number of those in-scope payments that were successfully exempted from SCA—either no 3D Secure was present or the payment went through the 3D Secure frictionless flow.\n\n**Exemption rate** is the proportion of attempted transactions that successfully completed.\n\nThe following section contains two views that help you understand changes to your exemption rate over the selected time period, along with the proportion of payment outcomes.\n\n![Authentication report exemption rate chart](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/exemption-outcome.1f9802e24b808e7ab560f890607dae90.png)\n\n*   **Succeeded—exempted** represents payments that succeeded without requiring an authentication challenge. Either the bank didn’t support 3DS or the payment went through the 3DS frictionless flow.\n*   **Succeeded—authenticated** represents payments that succeed with a two-factor challenge, such as a 3DS challenge flow or authentication through Apple Pay or Google Pay.\n*   **Failed** represents payments that didn’t go through. Either Radar blocked the payment, the issuing bank declined it, or the customer failed the challenge authentication.\n\nThe chart displayed on your Dashboard page shows the different exemptions that were used. Use the breakdown chart to better understand SCA enforcement across your target market, as well as performance of Stripe’s optimizations.\n\n![A chart that breaks down the types of exemptions that were used](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/exemption-breakdown.1eb7a2402236c8c6cc24248cedbc4982.png)\n\nThere are two ways to claim an SCA exemption:\n\n1.  Direct to authorization - where Stripe requests an exemption as part of the authorization message.\n2.  Stripe requests frictionless authentication by asking for an exemption in the 3DS messages.\n\nSee [Exemptions to Strong Customer Authentication](https://stripe.com/guides/strong-customer-authentication#exemptions-to-strong-customer-authentication) for details on the different types of exemptions.",

  "markdown": "# Przelewy24 payments with Sources | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Przelewy24 payments with SourcesBeta\n\n## Use Sources to accept payments using Przelewy24, the most popular payment method in Poland.\n\n#### Warning\n\nWe deprecated the Sources API and plan to remove support for local payment methods. If you currently integrate with Przelewy24 using the Sources API, you must [migrate to the Payment Methods API](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/transitioning). We’ll send email communication with more information about this end of support.\n\nFor information about integrating Przelewy24 with the current APIs, see [Przelewy24 payments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/p24).\n\nStripe users in Europe and the United States can accept [Przelewy24](https://www.przelewy24.pl/) payments from customers in Poland using [Sources](https://docs.stripe.com/sources).\n\nDuring the payment process, a [Source](https://docs.stripe.com/api#sources) object is created and your customer is redirected to their bank’s website or mobile application to authorize the payment. After completing this, your integration uses the source to make a charge request and complete the payment.\n\nPrzelewy24 is a [push](https://docs.stripe.com/sources#pull-or-push-of-funds)\\-based, [single-use](https://docs.stripe.com/sources#single-use-or-reusable) and [synchronous](https://docs.stripe.com/sources#synchronous-or-asynchronous-confirmation) method of payment. This means your customer takes action to send the amount to you through a [redirect](https://docs.stripe.com/sources#flow-for-customer-action) and there is immediate confirmation about the success or failure of a payment.\n\n[\n\n## Create a Source object![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n\n\n](#create-source)\n\nA `Source` object is either created client-side using [Stripe.js](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/elements) or server-side using the [Source creation endpoint](https://docs.stripe.com/api#create_source), with the following parameters:\n\n| Parameter | Value |\n| --- | --- |\n| `type` | **p24** |\n| `amount` | A positive integer in the [smallest currency unit](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#zero-decimal) representing the amount to charge the customer (for example, **1099** for a 10.99 EUR payment). |\n| `currency` | **eur** or **pln** (Przelewy24 payments must be in either Euros or Polish Zloty). |\n| `owner[name]` (optional) | The name of the account holder. |\n| `owner[email]` | The email address of the account holder. |\n| `redirect[return_url]` | The URL the customer should be redirected to after the authorization process. |\n| `statement_descriptor` (optional) | A custom statement descriptor for the payment. |\n\nTo create a source with [Stripe.js](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/elements), first include the library within your website and set your [publishable API key](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys). Once included, use the following `createSource` method to create a source client-side:\n\n`stripe.createSource({   type: 'p24',   amount: 1099,   currency: 'eur',   owner: {     name: 'Jenny Rosen',     email: 'jenny.rosen@example.com',   },   redirect: {     return_url: '__TOKEN_PLACEHOLDER_0__',   }, }).then(function(result) {   // handle result.error or result.source });`\n\nUsing either method, Stripe returns a `Source` object containing the relevant details for the method of payment used. Information specific to Przelewy24 is provided within the `p24` subhash.\n\n`{   \"id\": \"src_16xhynE8WzK49JbAs9M21jaR\",   \"object\": \"source\",   \"amount\": 1099,   \"client_secret\": \"src_client_secret_UfwvW2WHpZ0s3QEn9g5x7waU\",   \"created\": 1445277809,   \"currency\": \"eur\",   \"flow\": \"redirect\",   \"livemode\": true,   \"owner\": {`\n\n### Source creation in mobile applications![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nIf you’re building an iOS or Android app, you can implement sources using our mobile SDKs. Refer to our sources documentation for [iOS](https://docs.stripe.com/mobile/ios/sources) or [Android](https://docs.stripe.com/mobile/android/sources) to learn more.\n\n### Statement descriptors with Przelewy24 ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nPrzelewy24 lets you provide a custom [statement descriptor](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/activate#public-business-information) before the customer is redirected to authenticate the payment. It can be specified by providing `statement_descriptor` when creating a source.\n\nAdditionally, when the customer approves the payment, a unique reference will be stored on the Source under `p24[reference]`. You can share this reference with your customer to help locate payments.\n\nProviding a custom statement descriptor within a subsequent charge request has no effect.\n\n### Error codes![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nSource creation for Przelewy24 payments may return any of the following errors:\n\n| Error | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `payment_method_not_available` | The payment method is currently not available. You should invite your customer to fallback to another payment method to proceed. |\n| `processing_error` | An unexpected error occurred preventing us from creating the source. The source creation should be retried. |\n| `invalid_owner_email` | The owner email address is invalid. It must be a valid email address. |\n| `invalid_currency` | The currency is not supported for Przelewy24. It must either be `'eur'` or `'pln'`. |\n\n[\n\n## Have the customer authorize the payment![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n\n\n](#customer-action)\n\nWhen creating a source, its status is initially set to `pending` and cannot yet be used to make a charge request. Your customer must authorize a Przelewy24 payment to make the source chargeable. To allow your customer to authorize the payment, redirect them to the URL provided within the`redirect[url]` attribute of the `Source` object.\n\nAfter the authorization process, your customer is redirected back to the URL provided as a value of `redirect[return_url]`. This happens regardless of whether authorization was successful or not. If the customer has authorized the payment, the `Source` object’s status is updated to `chargeable` and it is ready to use in a charge request. If your customer declines the payment, the status transitions to `failed`.\n\nStripe populates the `redirect[return_url]` with the following GET parameters when returning your customer to your website:\n\n*   `source`: a string representing the original ID of the `Source` object\n*   `livemode`: indicates if this is a live payment, either `true` or `false`\n*   `client_secret`: used to confirm that the returning customer is the same one who triggered the creation of the source (source IDs are not considered secret)\n\nYou may include any other GET parameters you may need when specifying `redirect[return_url]`. Do not use the above as parameter names yourself as these would be overridden with the values we populate.\n\n### Mobile applications![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nTo integrate Przelewy24 within a mobile application, provide your application URI scheme as the `redirect[return_url]` value. By doing so, your customers are returned to your app after completing authorization. Refer to our Sources documentation for [iOS](https://docs.stripe.com/mobile/ios/sources) or [Android](https://docs.stripe.com/mobile/android/sources) to learn more.\n\nIf you are integrating without using our mobile SDKs, the redirect URL must be opened using the device’s native browser. The use of in-app web views and containers can prevent your customer from completing authentication—resulting in a lower conversion rate.\n\n### Testing the redirect process![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nWhen creating a `Source` object using your test API keys, you can follow the URL returned in the `redirect[url]` field. This leads to a Stripe page that displays information about the API request, and where you can either authorize or cancel the payment. Authorizing the payment redirects you to the URL specified in `redirect[return_url]`.\n\nAlternatively, to accelerate testing, use the following value for `owner[email]`, where `xxx_` is any prefix of your choice (these patterns are significant only in testmode):\n\n| Email Address | Effect |\n| --- | --- |\n| `xxx_chargeable@example.com` | The source will be created as `pending`, but automatically transition to `chargeable` within seconds of its creation. |\n\n[\n\n## Charge the Source![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n\n\n](#charge-request)\n\nOnce the customer has authenticated the payment, the source’s `status` transitions to `chargeable` and it can be used to make a charge request. This transition happens asynchronously and may occur after the customer was redirected back to your website.\n\nSome customers using Przelewy24 assume that the order process is complete once they have authenticated the payment and received confirmation from their bank. This results in customers who close their browser instead of following the redirect and returning to your app or website.\n\nFor these reasons it is essential that your integration rely on [webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks \"webhook\") to determine when the source becomes chargeable in order to create a charge. Please refer to our [best practices](https://docs.stripe.com/sources/best-practices) for more details on how to best integrate payment methods using webhooks.\n\n### Webhooks![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe following webhook events are sent to notify you about changes to the source’s status:\n\n| Event | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `source.chargeable` | A `Source` object becomes `chargeable` after a customer has authenticated and verified a payment. |\n| `source.failed` | A `Source` object failed to become chargeable as your customer declined to authenticate the payment. |\n| `source.canceled` | A `Source` object expired and cannot be used to create a charge. |\n\n### Make a charge request using the source![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nOnce the source is chargeable, from your `source.chargeable` webhook handler, you can make a charge request using the source ID as the value for the `source` parameter to complete the payment.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/charges \\   -u` \n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`: \\   -d amount=\"1099\" \\   -d currency=\"eur\" \\   -d source=src_18eYalAHEMiOZZp1l9ZTjSU0`\n\nPrzelewy24 Sources are [single-use](https://docs.stripe.com/sources#single-use-or-reusable) and cannot be used for recurring or additional payments. Refer to our [Sources & Customers](https://docs.stripe.com/sources/customers) guide for more information on how single-use Sources interact with [Customers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers \"Customers\").\n\n[\n\n## Confirm that the charge has succeeded![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n\n\n](#charge-confirmation)\n\nSince Przelewy24 is a [synchronous](https://docs.stripe.com/sources#synchronous-or-asynchronous-confirmation) payment method and the customer has already authenticated the payment as part of the redirect, unless there is an unexpected error, the [Charge](https://docs.stripe.com/api#charge_object) will immediately succeed.\n\n| Event | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `charge.succeeded` | The charge succeeded and the payment is complete. |\n\nWe recommend that you rely on the `charge.succeeded` webhook event to notify your customer that the payment process has been completed and their order is confirmed. Please refer to our [best practices](https://docs.stripe.com/sources/best-practices) for more details on how to best integrate payment methods using webhooks.\n\n### Disputed payments![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe risk of fraud or unrecognized payments is extremely low with Przelewy24 as the customer must authenticate the payment with their bank. As such, there is no dispute process that can result in a chargeback and funds withdrawn from your Stripe account.\n\n### Refunds![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nPayments made with Przelewy24 can only be submitted for refund within 180 days from the date of the original charge. After 180 days, it is no longer possible to refund the charge.\n\n### Sources expiration![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nA `chargeable` Przelewy24 source must be charged within six hours of becoming `chargeable`. If it is not, its status is automatically transitioned to `canceled` and your integration receives a `source.canceled` webhook event. Once a chargeable source is canceled, the customer’s authenticated Przelewy24 payment is refunded automatically—no money is moved into your account. For this reason, make sure the order is canceled on your end and the customer is notified when you receive the `source.canceled` event.\n\nAdditionally, `pending` sources are canceled after one hour if they are not used to authenticate a payment, ensuring that all sources eventually transition out of their `pending` state to the `canceled` state if they are not used.",

On the client, the customer could close the browser window or quit the app before the callback executes, and malicious clients could manipulate the response. Setting up your integration to listen for asynchronous events also makes it easier to accept more payment methods in the future. Check out our [guide to payment methods](https://stripe.com/payments/payment-methods-guide) to see the differences between all supported payment methods.\n\n### Manually![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nUse the Stripe Dashboard to view all your Stripe payments, send email receipts, handle payouts, or retry failed payments.\n\n*   [View your test payments in the Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/payments)\n\n### Custom code![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nBuild a webhook handler to listen for events and build custom asynchronous payment flows.

In test mode, this redirects you to a test payment page where you can approve or decline the payment.\n\nIn live mode, tapping **Pay** redirects you to the MobilePay mobile application, where you can approve or decline the payment.\n\n[](#failed-payments)\n\nMobilePay transactions can fail if the underlying card transaction is declined. Learn more about [card declines](https://docs.stripe.com/declines/card). In this case, the PaymentMethod is detached and the PaymentIntent’s status automatically transitions to `requires_payment_method`.\n\nWhen the PaymentIntent’s status is `requires_action`, your customer must authenticate the payment within 5 minutes. If no action is taken after 5 minutes, the PaymentMethod detaches and the PaymentIntent’s status automatically transitions to `requires_payment_method`.\n\n[\n\n## Refunds and disputes![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n\n\n](#refunds-and-disputes)\n\nStripe performs a card transaction using standard card rails as part of a MobilePay transaction.

This includes registering top-level domains and subdomains. For example, if you have the domain **yourdomain.com** and subdomains like **shop.yourdomain.com** and **www.yourdomain.com**, this guide explains how to register them.\n\nAfter you register a domain, that domain is ready for use with other payment methods that you might enable in the future.\n\nThe following payment methods require registration:\n\n*   Google Pay\n*   Link\n*   PayPal\n*   Apple Pay (additional verification step required)\n\n#### Apple Pay and merchant validation\n\nThe Apple Pay documentation describes their process of “merchant validation,\" which Stripe handles for you behind the scenes. You don’t need to create an Apple Merchant ID or CSR. Instead, follow the steps in this guide.\n\n## Testing![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYou also need to register domains for testing. When testing locally, you can use a tool such as [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to get an HTTPS domain. You can either register in test mode, or register in live mode and the domain will also be registered in test mode automatically. Remember to register your domains in live mode before going live.\n\nYou can create and manage domains in the Dashboard on the [Payment method domains page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_method_domains) for use in production and testing.\n\n#### Using Connect\n\nConnect platforms that create direct charges must use the API to manage domains for their [connected accounts](#register-a-domain-using-connect), not the Stripe Dashboard.\n\n## Register your domain![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nTo register a domain:\n\n1.  On the [Payment method domains page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_method_domains), click **Add a new domain**.\n2.  Enter your domain name.\n3.  Click **Save and continue**.\n4.  If you’re setting up Apple Pay, verify ownership of your domain with Apple by following the steps described later on this page.\n5.  (Optional) Repeat steps 1-4 for additional domains that you need to register.\n\nAfter completing these steps, your domain shows up on the Payment method domains page.\n\n### Using an iframe![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n*   When using an iframe, its origin must match the top-level origin, except in Safari 17+. Two pages have the same origin if the protocol, host (full domain name), and port (if specified) are the same for both pages.\n*   When using a cross-origin iframe in Safari 17+ you must specify the `allow=“payment”` attribute. To enable Apple Pay, you must also register the source domain that the iframe loads.\n\n## Verify ownership of your domain with Apple Pay ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nDuring registration, Stripe automatically attempts to verify ownership of your domain with Apple. If the domain isn’t already verified, register your domain and then follow these steps to verify your registered domain with Apple Pay.\n\n#### Common mistake\n\nApple attempts to request your domain association file, so it needs to be publicly available to [Apple’s servers](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple_pay_on_the_web/setting_up_your_server#3179116).\n\n1.  Download the [domain association file](https://stripe.com/files/apple-pay/apple-developer-merchantid-domain-association).\n2.  Host the file at `/.well-known/apple-developer-merchantid-domain-association`. For example, if you register `https://yourdomain.com`, make that file available at `https://yourdomain.com/.well-known/apple-developer-merchantid-domain-association`.\n3.  Click **Verify**.\n\n## Manage your domain![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYou can see a list of all of your domains in the Dashboard.\n\nTo disable a domain, click the row action and then click **Disable**. If a domain is disabled, the payment methods no longer appear in Elements or Checkout’s embeddable payment form on that domain.\n\nTo enable a disabled domain, click the row action and then click **Enable**.\n\n## Register your domain while using Connect![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nConnect platforms must register all domains where Elements or Checkout’s embeddable payment form displays the payment methods listed above. The domain where the charge is being run needs to be registered for the user running the charge.\n\nIf the platform creates [direct charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges), use your platform’s secret key to authenticate the request and set the Stripe-Account header to your connected account’s Stripe ID.\n\nIf the platform creates [destination charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges) or [separate charges and transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers), use your platform’s secret key to authenticate the request and omit the Stripe-Account header.\n\nLearn more about [Making API calls for connected accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/authentication).\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/payment_method_domains \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -H \"Stripe-Account:   {{CONNECTED_ACCOUNT_ID}}  \" \\  -d domain_name=\"example.com\"`",

  "markdown": "# Cash App Pay payments | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Learn how to accept Cash App Pay, a digital wallet popular with US customers.\n\nCash App is a popular consumer app in the US that allows customers to bank, invest, send, and receive money using their digital wallet.\n\nCash App Pay is a payment method available to all Cash App customers for single use and recurring payments to businesses. Cash App Pay uses the customer’s stored balance or linked debit card to fund the payment. The customer can confirm the payment in one of two ways:\n\n*   During checkout from a mobile device, your site redirects customers to the Cash App mobile application for authentication. The payment is authenticated during the redirect. No additional action is needed in the Cash App mobile application to complete the purchase. The customer is then redirected back to your site.\n*   During checkout from a desktop web application, the customer scans a QR code with their mobile device to authenticate the transaction.\n\n*   **Customer locations**\n    \n    US customers (excluding accounts in US territories).\n    \n*   **Presentment currency**\n    \n    USD\n    \n*   **Payment confirmation**\n    \n    Customer-initiated\n    \n*   **Payment method family**\n    \n    Digital wallet\n    \n*   **Billing support**\n    \n    Yes\n    \n*   **Payout timing**\n    \n    Standard payout timing applies\n    \n*   **Connect support**\n    \n    Yes\n    \n*   **Dispute support**\n    \n    Yes\n    \n*   **Manual capture support**\n    \n    Yes\n    \n*   **Refunds / Partial refunds**\n    \n    Yes / yes\n    \n\n## Payment flow ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nThis demo shows the customer experience when using Cash App Pay.\n\n## Get started ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nTo get started, see [Accept a payment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/cash-app-pay/accept-a-payment).\n\nYou don’t have to integrate Cash App Pay and other payment methods individually. If you use our front-end products, Stripe automatically determines the most relevant payment methods to display. Go to the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) and enable Cash App Pay. To get started with one of our hosted UIs, follow a quickstart:\n\n*   [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/quickstart): Our prebuilt, hosted checkout page.\n*   [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/quickstart): Our drop-in UI components.\n\n### Other payment products![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe following Stripe products also let you add Cash App Pay from the Dashboard:\n\n*   [Invoicing](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/quickstart-guide)\n*   [Payment Links](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links)\n*   [Subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/overview)\n\nBoost conversion by letting your customers know you accept payments with Cash App Pay by including their approved [brand assets](https://developers.cash.app/docs/api/resources/Cash-App-Pay-assets) on your website.\n\n## Payment limits and options ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nWhile there are no business level minimum or maximum limits enforced, Cash App sets variable customer level limits for sending and receiving money. This limit is based on a number of factors such as verification status of the customer’s account and transaction history. Use Cash App Pay for lower value orders (for example, below 2000 USD) to reduce the likelihood of a decline.\n\nCash App Pay uses either the customer’s Cash App balance or linked debit card to fund the transaction. By default, Cash App Pay uses the customer’s Cash App balance if the balance can cover the entirety of the order amount. Otherwise, it uses the customer’s linked debit card. A Cash App customer can’t combine payment options for a single order (for example, using the balance for part of the order amount and debit card for the remainder).\n\n## Prohibited and restricted business categories ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nIn addition to the categories of [businesses restricted from using Stripe overall](https://stripe.com/legal/restricted-businesses), the following categories are prohibited from using Cash App Pay:\n\n*   B2B businesses\n*   Financial services\n*   Businesses accepting Cash App Pay for gift card purchases\n\nPlatforms focused on fundraising, donations, and alcohol sales must seek additional approvals from Stripe. Contact us for additional information.\n\n## Refunds ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nReturns are subject to the return policy that you display on your website. If your business allows returns, you can [refund](https://docs.stripe.com/refunds) Cash App Pay transactions as you normally would for card payments. Cash App Pay supports partial or full refunds for up to 90 days after the original purchase, and processes them asynchronously. After Stripe initiates a refund, Cash App Pay issues the refund to the customer’s original form of payment (either their Cash App balance or linked debit card).\n\nStripe notifies you of the final refund status using the [charge.refund.updated](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-charge.refund.updated) [webhook](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks \"webhook\") event. When a refund succeeds, the [Refund](https://docs.stripe.com/api/refunds/object) object’s status transitions to `succeeded`. If the refund fails, the Refund object’s status transitions to `failed` and Stripe returns the amount to your Stripe balance. In these cases, you need to arrange an alternative way of providing your customer with a refund.\n\n## Disputes and fraud ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nCustomers must authenticate Cash App Pay payments by logging in to their Cash App account. This requirement helps reduce the risk of fraud or unrecognized payments. Cash App takes financial liability for any losses due to customer fraud.\n\nCustomers can dispute Cash App Pay payments in certain cases–for example, if they’re unaware of the transaction, don’t receive the goods or services, receive duplicate charges for the same transaction, or cancel the transaction without receiving a refund. Customers have 120 calendar days to file a dispute from the date of the original charge, or in situations where they didn’t receive goods, 120 calendar days from the expected receipt date.\n\nIf the Cash App Pay payment used the customer’s linked debit card as the underlying source for payment, customers can initiate a dispute in one of the following ways:\n\n1.  Directly with their issuing financial institution.\n2.  Directly with Cash App. This is the only option for payments that use the Cash App stored balance as the underlying source.\n\nAfter the customer initiates a dispute, Stripe notifies you using:\n\n*   Email notification\n*   The Stripe Dashboard\n*   An API [charge.dispute.created](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-charge.dispute.created) event (if your integration is set up to receive [webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks))\n\nWhen a customer creates a dispute, Stripe deducts the amount of the dispute and associated dispute fee from your Stripe balance until Cash App Pay resolves the dispute. Stripe requests that you upload compelling evidence that you fulfilled the purchase order using the [Stripe Dashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/responding#respond). This evidence can include:\n\n*   Received return confirmation (for shipped goods returned from the customer to you)\n*   Tracking ID\n*   Shipping date\n*   Record of purchase for intangible goods, such as IP address or email receipt\n*   Record of purchase for services or physical goods, such as phone number or proof of receipt\n\nIf you would rather handle disputes programmatically, you can [respond to disputes using the API](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/api).\n\nYou must submit the requested information within 13 calendar days. Cash App Pay makes a decision within 58 calendar days of dispute creation. If Cash App Pay resolves the dispute with you winning, Stripe returns the disputed amount to your Stripe balance. If they rule in favor of the customer, the balance charge becomes permanent.\n\n## Statement descriptors![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nEvery Cash App Pay payment appears on the customer’s bank statement with the `CashApp*` prefix attached to the merchant name. The merchant name is set to the [`company.name`](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts/object#account_object-company-name) field.\n\nUnlike cards, Cash App Pay does not support a dynamic statement descriptor to be set at the transaction level. This means that the `statement_descriptor` value in a PaymentIntent request is ignored for Cash App Pay payments.\n\n## Connect ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nIf you use [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect), take the following into consideration before you enable and use Cash App Pay:\n\n### Request Cash App Pay capabilities for your connected accounts![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nSet the `cashapp_payments` capability to `active` on your platform account, and for any connected accounts you want to enable for Cash App Pay. You can do this without code by navigating to the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) and making sure Cash App Pay is on by default for your connected accounts, or you can [request the account capability](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/account-capabilities#requesting-unrequesting).\n\n### Business of record and statement descriptors![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe [charge type](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/charges) of Connect payments might change the default statement descriptor and the business name that appears on the customer’s bank statement.

If you use our front-end products, Stripe automatically determines the most relevant payment methods to display. Go to the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) and enable Konbini. To get started with one of our hosted UIs, follow a quickstart:\n\n*   [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/quickstart): Our prebuilt, hosted checkout page.\n*   [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/quickstart): Our drop-in UI components.\n\n### Other payment products![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe following Stripe products also let you add Konbini from the Dashboard:\n\n*   [Invoicing](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/quickstart-guide)\n*   [Payment Links](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links)\n*   [Subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/overview)\n\nIf you prefer to manually list payment methods, learn how to [manually configure Konbini as a payment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/konbini/accept-a-payment).\n\n## Disputed payments ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nKonbini payments have a low risk of fraud or unrecognized payments because the customer must provide cash payment in person at a convenience store. Generally Konbini payments cannot be disputed by the customer. However, in rare instances irregularities similar in nature to disputes (by the convenience store) might arise, (for example, due to mishandling). Stripe will need to reach out to you in such cases and ask for your cooperation.\n\n## Refunds ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nKonbini payments can be refunded either through the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/payments) or [API](https://docs.stripe.com/api#create_refund). To complete a refund, your customer must provide account information where funds should be returned to. Stripe automatically contacts the customer at the email address provided at time of PaymentIntent confirmation and requests this information from them, after which the refund is processed automatically.\n\n## Billing ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nUse [Stripe Billing](https://stripe.com/billing) to create Konbini supported [subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/creating \"subscriptions\") and [invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices \"invoices\").\n\nDue to the in-person nature of Konbini payments, [automatically charged](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/automatic-charging) invoices are not supported.\n\nInvoices and subscriptions need to be configured with a [collection\\_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/object#invoice_object-collection_method) of `send_invoice`.\n\n## Prohibited business categories ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nOn top of the categories of [businesses restricted from using Stripe overall](https://stripe.com/restricted-businesses), the following categories are specifically prohibited from using Konbini.\n\n*   Sole proprietors who have been doing business for less than 3 years\n*   Real Money Trading (RMT), that is, sale of virtual (in-game) characters, currency, and so on.\n*   Gambling\n*   Information selling, in particular:\n    *   Money making schemes\n    *   Investment related information\n    *   Gambling strategies for horse racing, pachinko, slot machines, and so on\n*   Multi-level marketing and pyramid schemes\n*   Gore content or products\n*   Unscientific and superstition-based content or products\n*   Prohibited medical products (per the Japanese Pharmaceutical Affairs Act)\n*   Content or products offensive to public order or moral\n*   Personal import facilitation (forwarding)\n*   Foreign money transfer\n*   Loans\n*   Dating sites\n*   E-cigarettes (vaping), waterpipes (shisha, hookah), and so on\n*   Fortune-telling\n\nPlease keep in mind that our financial partner and convenience store chains may reject businesses at their discretion regardless of category.",

  "markdown": "# Customized start of day | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Set your start of day to make your automatic payouts reconciliation easier to track.\n\nStripe supports customized start of day for automatic [payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts \"payout\") to group and send payments in your local timezone with a “customized day” starting time. This makes payout reconciliation easier to track as payouts contain payments processed in a day of your timezone, versus payments processed in a UTC day.\n\nFor example, if a user in Singapore starts their customized day at midnight SGT (Singapore Time), the payments they process from midnight SGT to the following midnight SGT belong to the same day. If they start their day at 06:00 SGT, payments collected between 06:00 SGT on a given day and 06:00 SGT the next day are attributed to the given day.\n\nYour default start of day is UTC midnight [except for some users in Asia-Pacific (APAC) markets](https://support.stripe.com/questions/default-start-of-day-for-asia-pacific-%28apac%29-payouts). You can change your start of day to a time in the allowed range (usually between midnight and morning) in your local timezone.\n\n## Feature availability ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nCustomized start of day is available in the following countries:\n\nAustralia\n\nHong Kong\n\nIndia\n\nIndonesia\n\nJapan\n\nMalaysia\n\nNew Zealand\n\nPhilippines\n\nSingapore\n\nThailand\n\n## Change start of day ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nTo change the start of day:\n\n1.  In the Dashboard, navigate to **Settings** > [**External payout accounts and scheduling**](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payouts).\n2.  In the **Start of day** section, change the default setting to your preferred start of day.\n\n![Start of day settings in the Dashboard](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/payout-schedule-page-start-of-day-1.b11ce1ceac6e24873a3a5a2a68594ba3.png)\n\nAfter you set the start of day, it doesn’t take effect immediately. The new start of day only takes effect at the new time. For example, if your current time is equivalent to 07:00 Asia/Singapore, and you set the start of day to 00:00 Asia/Singapore, this new start of day takes effect in 17 hours.\n\n![Dashboard callout notifying when the new start of day takes effect](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/payout-schedule-page-start-of-day-2.f64163c5eb39a0eb6c1f6757e50d73b7.png)\n\nThe settings at the time of the original transaction apply to the payout as well. For example, if the settings at the time of the original transaction indicate a 7-day payout timing, this rule applies to the payout regardless of any later changes in time zones. Let’s say a merchant has a balance of 1000 USD. 500 USD is attributed to UTC Monday and 500 USD is attributed to UTC Tuesday. If their start of the day changes to Singapore Time (SGT) on Wednesday, the 1000 USD balance is still assigned to UTC Monday and Tuesday, and the payout will be processed on the next Monday and Tuesday under UTC, not SGT. Only the payments created after the change to SGT will follow the new time zone in terms of payout timing.\n\n## Example ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nA restaurant merchant’s business hours are 10AM to 9PM PST, all the transactions made before the start of business count towards the previous day because they’ve chosen 10AM as their start of day. Assuming this merchant is on a daily automatic payout plan and a 4 business day schedule, all transactions made between 10AM PST Monday and 10AM PST Tuesday are grouped into Monday’s sales and arrive in the merchant’s bank before the end of Friday in one payout.",

Make sure the information reflects the current ownership.\n    \n*   **Additional information**: If your company employs people, owns property, operates locally in the US, or operates abroad, you might have additional tax and reporting requirements. Some of the taxes you might want to ask your accountant about include:\n    \n    *   Transfer pricing (if you’re based outside the US).\n    *   State taxes (if you have business activity in any US state).\n    *   Sales taxes.\n    *   Employment taxes.\n\nIf you’re still waiting for your EIN, you can enter **Applied For** and the application date (which you can find on your Form SS-4 in the Dashboard) in your tax forms.\n\n## Tax partners ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nEach US business is required to pay income taxes. We’ve partnered with tax and accounting advisors who specialize in working with startups to provide you affordable options for filing your corporate income taxes. Top startups use these services and they offer discounts for Stripe Atlas users. Each service specializes in a different area—choose the one that’s right for your company.\n\n1.  [Mosey](https://mosey.com/stripe-atlas/) is best for startups that want ongoing help with registration and compliance filings in multiple states without federal tax prep or bookkeeping.\n2.  [Bench](https://bench.co/partner/stripe-atlas/?utm_campaign=support) is best for pre-revenue startups or small startups who want recurring tax or bookkeeping services for state and federal taxes.\n3.  [Pilot](https://pilot.com/partner/atlas?utm_medium=web&utm_source=partner&utm_campaign=atlas_referrals) is best for startups planning to raise funding, who want recurring tax and bookkeeping services for state and federal taxes.\n4.  [Cleer](https://www.cleer.tax/partner/atlas) is best for startups that want one-time assistance with federal and state tax prep.\n\n## File taxes in Delaware ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nYour company’s tax and reporting obligations in Delaware depend on whether you’re forming a [C Corporation](https://docs.stripe.com/atlas/company-types?business-type=ccorp) or an [LLC](https://docs.stripe.com/atlas/company-types?business-type=llc).\n\nDelaware LLCs pay an annual LLC tax, sometimes referred to as the Business Entity Tax. If you want to hire a tax professional to complete this, you can work with one of our [tax partners](https://docs.stripe.com/atlas/business-taxes#tax-partners) or a tax advisor of your own choosing.\n\n### Annual LLC tax ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nAll LLCs formed or registered in Delaware must pay an annual LLC tax, currently at a flat rate of 300 USD. There’s no requirement to file an annual report. If the annual LLC tax isn’t submitted by June 1, there is a 200 USD penalty and interest of 1.5% per month on the tax amount (and penalty) originally due.\n\n#### Pay the annual Delaware LLC tax ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nYou can save your work and return to it later, just make sure to save your session number, which the Delaware portal gives you the option of sending to an email address for easier access.\n\n1.  Login to [the state of Delaware’s website](https://icis.corp.delaware.gov/ecorp/logintax.aspx?FilingType=FranchiseTax) with your seven digit Delaware Business Entity File Number.\n    *   You can easily find your company’s file number in two ways:\n        1.  Use [Delaware’s entity search tool](https://icis.corp.delaware.gov/ecorp/EntitySearch/NameSearch.aspx) with your company’s legal name.\n        2.  Find the State of Delaware stamp on page 2 of your **Filed Certificate of Incorporation**, accessible in your [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/atlas/company).\n2.  Click the green **Pay taxes** button. You should see a flat 300 USD fee for LLC.\n    *   You can pay your Delaware LLC tax fee either by credit card or ACH. After inputting your payment information, push the green **Submit** button to finalize your Delaware state taxes.\n\n## State taxes beyond Delaware ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nIf your company operates in any US states other than Delaware, it might be subject to annual taxation, registration, and reporting requirements in the other states. Stripe recommends that you consult legal and tax professionals about what requirements apply to your business.\n\n## 2024 key tax season dates ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nPlan ahead to meet any tax deadlines that apply to your business. Refer to the following information if your company was active in 2023.\n\n*   March 15, 2024: [US LLC partnership income tax](https://docs.stripe.com/atlas/business-taxes?business-type=llc) due, or due date to submit an extension to file taxes later in the year.\n*   April 15, 2024: US individual income tax due date.\n*   June 1, 2024: [Delaware annual LLC tax](https://docs.stripe.com/atlas/business-taxes?business-type=llc#annual-llc-tax) due.\n*   September 16, 2024: If you filed for an extension, this is the due date for filing [US LLC partnership income tax](https://docs.stripe.com/atlas/business-taxes?business-type=llc).\n\nAlso, if your US company has employees or makes payments to US vendors, you might be required to file a US W-2 or 1099 form by January 31, 2024.\n\n### Dissolve your company ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nIf you aren’t operating your company anymore, you might still be obligated to file taxes every year until you dissolve it. When you dissolve a company, you might have tax filings and obligations for the year that you dissolve the company. You can work with our tax partners to figure out what your obligations are.\n\nC Corporations can be dissolved in the state of Delaware only after they pay Delaware franchise tax and file their annual report. LLCs can be dissolved only after they pay annual LLC tax (no annual report is required).\n\nYou can start the process of dissolving your company from the [Company tab](https://dashboard.stripe.com/atlas/company) of your Atlas Dashboard. You should consider working with a lawyer to ensure full dissolution of your company.\n\n## See also![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n*   [Tax season guide](https://stripe.com/atlas/guides/tax-season)\n*   [Business taxes guide](https://stripe.com/atlas/guides/business-taxes)\n*   [Bookkeeping and accounting guide](https://stripe.com/guides/atlas/bookkeeping-and-accounting)\n*   [State of Delaware’s tax FAQ](https://corp.delaware.gov/taxfaq/)",

The following list contains some of the characteristics of a C Corporation:\n\n*   **Defined governance structure**: A C Corporation has a well-known, regulated, management structure.\n*   **Ownership**: A C Corporation’s structure facilitates granting equity to employees, advisors, and investors.\n*   **Raising outside funding**: A Delaware C Corporation is the entity generally preferred by outside institutional investors who might be unable to invest in LLCs.\n*   **Tax treatment**: A C Corporation with early startup losses can generally use the losses in future years, subject to various limitations, to reduce future taxable income when the company becomes profitable.\n\n## When to form your company ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nIf you plan to form your company near the end of the calendar year, it can make sense to wait until the start of the new year to form your company because of the tax implications. C Corporations active in Delaware any time before December 31 owe at least the minimum Delaware franchise tax for that year. LLCs active before December 31 owe the full annual LLC tax for that year.\n\nNeither the franchise tax nor the LLC tax is prorated. Your company might also owe US federal corporate income tax for the outgoing year. It might also owe taxes to a US state other than Delaware, depending on where the LLC operates.",

  "markdown": "# Style your app | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Learn how to style UI components in your app.\n\nYou can style a Stripe App using design tokens that we provide. This helps you match the Dashboard visually, provide consistency, and maintain a high quality bar.\n\n*   The `Box` and `Inline` components support [custom styles](#custom-styles).\n*   Other components have [preset styles](#preset-styles) which you can sometimes adjust.\n\n## Custom styles![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe [Box](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/components/box) and [Inline](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/components/inline) components support custom styles. `Box` and `Inline` are styleable containers like HTML `div` and `span`. To style them, use their `css` prop. They use CSS syntax, with a few differences from vanilla CSS.\n\n`<Box   css={{     padding: 'xxlarge',     color: 'secondary',     backgroundColor: 'container',     borderRadius: 'small',   }} >   This is a box. </Box>`\n\nUnlike in vanilla CSS, you can’t choose arbitrary font faces and styles. Use the `font` and `fontWeight` properties. For more information, see [Typography](#typograpphy).\n\n`<Inline css={{font: 'body', color: 'primary', fontWeight: 'semibold'}}>   This text is emphasized </Inline>`\n\nLayout also works differently than it does in vanilla CSS. Instead, Stripe Apps use the same layout system Stripe uses internally.

You can sometimes control or override the presets in a specific way.\n\n### Automatic styling![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nSome components style themselves automatically. For example, [Chips](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/components/chip) automatically change their appearance depending on what callbacks they implement. This helps the user understand their behavior. To avoid confusion, you can’t override these details.\n\n`<ChipList>   <Chip     label=\"Currency\"     value=\"USD\"     onDropdown={() => {       alert('Dropdown function triggered');     }}     onClose={() => {       alert('Close function triggered');     }}   />   <Chip     label=\"Status\"     value=\"Succeeded\"     onDropdown={() => {       alert('Dropdown function triggered');     }}     onClose={() => {       alert('Close function triggered');     }}   />   <Chip     label=\"Amount\"     onAddSuggestion={() => {       alert('Add Amount suggestion');     }}   />   <Chip     label=\"Date\"     onAddSuggestion={() => {       alert('Add Date suggestion');     }}   /> </ChipList>`\n\n### Several presets![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nSome components, like [Buttons](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/components/button), have a few styles you can select using a prop. See the documentation for each component for details.\n\n`<Button type=\"primary\">Primary</Button> <Button>Secondary</Button> <Button type=\"destructive\">Destructive</Button>`\n\n### Limited CSS![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nSome components support specific CSS properties. For example, [Icons](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/components/icon) support color using the `fill` property. See the documentation for each component for details.\n\n`<Icon name=\"cancelCircle\" css={{fill: 'critical'}} />`",

  "markdown": "# Dispute response best practices | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Learn how to format the most convincing evidence to challenge a dispute.\n\nWhen an account owner disputes a payment with their bank, they must provide evidence to support their claim. In many cases, the bank’s goal is to protect their customer from having to pay for something they didn’t authorize or feel was misrepresented or damaged.\n\nAs the seller, you have the right to counter the account owner’s claim and provide evidence that supports your case. While Stripe doesn’t influence the ultimate outcome of the bank’s decision, our goal is to help you defend the dispute. We base the best practices that we provide here on our deep exposure to dispute resolution.\n\n## Likelihood of winning disputes![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYour chances of overturning a dispute vary significantly based on several factors, including:\n\n*   The type of dispute\n*   The strength of the evidence you submit\n*   The type of payment (debit, credit, digital wallet, and so on)\n*   The type of purchase (online, in-person, physical product, service, and so on)\n\nStripe’s [Radar for Fraud Teams](https://stripe.com/radar/fraud-teams) uses Radar’s machine learning (ML) models to estimate your chances of winning a dispute. It gives you a prediction score in the dispute details page of your Dashboard, so you can prioritize disputes.\n\nIf you’re enrolled in Radar, but don’t see a win likelihood prediction next to a dispute, it’s likely one of the following reasons:\n\n*   The payment wasn’t made with a credit card\n*   The payment has only received an [inquiry](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/how-disputes-work#inquiries), not an actual dispute\n*   An error prevented us from generating a prediction (this is rare)\n\nThe prediction score ranks your likelihood of winning a dispute that you’ve submitted relevant evidence for from lowest (one dot) to highest (five dots). The following table shows the expected win percentage for each ranking. Even in the most favorable cases, it’s very difficult to overturn a disputed payment.\n\n| Dispute Win Likelihood Ranking | Chance of Winning the Dispute |\n| --- | --- |\n| 5 dots | 60% |\n| 4 dots | 40% |\n| 3 dots | 25% |\n| 2 dots | 15% |\n| 1 dot | 5%  |\n\n## Keep your evidence relevant to the dispute reason and to the point![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nCard issuers review thousands of dispute responses every day. Writing a long explanation to them isn’t going to make your responses more convincing. Similarly, providing evidence about your clearly stated return policy isn’t relevant for a dispute claiming that the customer never received the product. Instead, describe clearly and concisely why the claim is unreasonable and how your evidence proves that, using a neutral and professional tone. For example:\n\n> Jenny Rosen purchased \\[product\\] from our company on \\[date\\] using a Visa credit card. We shipped the product on \\[date\\] to the address provided by the customer, and it was delivered on \\[date\\], as shown in the tracking file provided, so the claim that the product was not received isn’t true.\n\nYou can investigate the dispute while collecting evidence. For example, you can review Google Maps and Street View to see where your delivery took place, or check social media to help establish the customer as the legitimate cardholder.\n\nMany businesses also include email correspondence or texts with their customer, but be aware that these exchanges don’t verify identity. If you include them, only include the relevant excerpts. For example, if you include a long email thread, redact any duplicated copy in the chain.\n\nKeep your evidence factual, professional, and concise. Providing too little evidence is a problem, but overwhelming the card issuer with unnecessary content can obscure your argument.\n\n## Limit evidence file length ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nCard issuers manually review thousands of dispute responses daily and won’t comb through lengthy files to find the relevant argument for the network reason code.\n\nFor example, if the dispute network reason code indicates “Canceled Merchandise”, but the customer didn’t comply with your cancellation policy, don’t submit your entire Terms and Conditions agreement. Upload only the relevant cancellation policy section and use a callout or arrow to emphasize the details your customer violated.\n\n![Comparison of good and bad evidence file examples](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/best-practice-file-length.270360400d9d0c70979f5f5e916d043a.png)\n\n*   **Do:**\n    \n    *   Paste relevant excerpts from your terms into a single doc.\n    *   Outline or underline text specific to the dispute type.\n    \n*   **Don’t:**\n    \n    *   Upload your entire terms of service.\n    \n\nYou can also decrease file size by:\n\n*   Reducing font size\n*   Single spacing documents\n*   Shrinking images within PDFs\n\nThe following information is essential for file types:\n\n| Evidence type | Relevant data |\n| --- | --- |\n| Receipt | Date, currency, amount of disputed items |\n| Shipping documentation | Delivery date and full shipping address |\n| Cancellation policy or other Terms of service | Relevant subsections only |\n| Customer communication | Customer name and relevant message |\n\nFraudulent disputes account for over half of all disputes. It’s important to prove the legitimate cardholder was aware of and authorized the transaction in such cases. Any data that shows proof of this is a standard part of a compelling response, such as:\n\n*   AVS (Address Verification System) matches\n*   CVC (Card Verification Code) confirmations\n*   Signed receipts or contracts\n*   IP address that matches the cardholder’s verified billing address\n\nStripe always includes any AVS or CVC results along with the purchase IP address (if available from your Stripe integration). But if you have any other evidence of authorization (for example, 3DS authentication) include it too.\n\n## Include proof of service or delivery![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nAfter fraudulent disputes, other high frequency dispute [reasons](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/categories) include claims from cardholders that products or services:\n\n*   Weren’t delivered\n*   Were defective or unsatisfactory\n*   Weren’t as described\n\nProvide proof of service or delivery to refute such claims.\n\nFor a merchandise purchase, provide proof of shipment and delivery that includes the full delivery address, not just the city and postal code verification.\n\nIf your customer provides a “Ship to” name that differs from their own (for example, a gift purchase), be prepared to provide documentation explaining why they’re different. While it’s common practice to purchase and ship to an address that doesn’t match the verified billing address for the card, this is an additional dispute risk.\n\nIf your business provides digital goods, include evidence such as an IP address or system log proving the customer downloaded the content or used your software or service.\n\n## Include a copy of your terms of service and refund policy![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nWhen it comes to disputes, fine print matters. For returns or refunds, it’s critical to provide proof that your customer agreed to and understood your terms of service at checkout, or didn’t follow your policies. Include a clean screenshot of how you present your terms of service during checkout, with the relevant policy clearly emphasized.\n\nDon’t, however, include the text of your entire policy, because card issuers won’t read through it all to find the relevant copy.\n\n## Combine files of the same evidence type![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYou must specify an evidence type for each file you upload, and you can only submit one piece of evidence per type. For example, you can combine several items representing communication with your customer (email messages, text screenshots, phone transcripts, and so on) into a single file for the `Customer communication` evidence. This also decreases your overall file length.\n\n## Formatting documents and images to upload ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nInclude large, clear images for review. Whether you upload files through the Dashboard or the API, both have limitations on the acceptable file types and the combined file size.\n\n*   Only PDF, JPEG, or PNG file types are accepted\n*   The combined file size can’t be more than 4.5MB\n*   The combined page count must be less than 50 pages\n*   You can compress your files with tools such as [Smallpdf](https://smallpdf.com/)\n\nWhen submitting documents or images as evidence, use the following recommendations to make sure they can remain legible:\n\n*   Use a 12 point font or larger\n*   Make sure that documents are US Letter or A4 size, in portrait orientation (you can still add screenshots to your documents in landscape orientation)\n*   Use bold text, callouts, or arrows to draw attention to pertinent information\n*   Avoid using color highlighting\n\nWhen uploading screenshots:\n\n*   Crop the screenshot to the area of interest and circle any key components (for example, delivery confirmation or signature)\n*   Use the text fields in the dispute evidence form to describe what the image contains and how it supports your response\n\nThe card issuer won’t review a response containing any illegible text or data.\n\n## Accepting disputes![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYou can accept a dispute, effectively agreeing that the cardholder’s reason for the dispute is valid. Accepting a dispute isn’t considered an admission of wrongdoing and is sometimes the most appropriate response. The customer has already received their refund through the dispute process—–if you agree with the refund, it’s best to accept the dispute.\n\nTake this action if you don’t intend to respond and submit evidence. Although accepting disputes doesn’t negatively affect your business any further, it’s not a viable alternative to an effective refund or returns policy. Dispute activity is calculated based on the disputes received, not won or lost, so dispute prevention is critical.\n\n#### Note\n\nDisputes incur a dispute fee that still applies if you accept the dispute.\n\n## Misunderstandings![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nFor disputes that are the result of a misunderstanding, your customer can tell their card issuer that they [no longer dispute the transaction](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/withdrawing). We recommend you still submit evidence to show that the payment was valid and to make sure the card issuer knows you’re not accepting the dispute.\n\nIn cases where you agree that the customer should keep the disputed funds, accept the dispute rather than ask the cardholder to withdraw the dispute for a regular refund. Remember, the card networks don’t consider how many disputes you win or lose, only how many you receive—a withdrawn dispute still counts as a dispute.\n\n## Disputes on partially refunded payments ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nWhile uncommon, a customer can dispute a payment for the full amount even if they’ve already received a partial refund (for example, a refund of a smaller amount that has been agreed upon). We understand this is frustrating as it amounts to an over-refund of more than the original purchase. Always respond in such cases because card issuers are very willing to rectify this situation.\n\n#### Note\n\nBecause merchants can’t contest Cartes Bancaires disputes, you can’t ask the issuer to consider an existing partial refund when the full amount of a Cartes Bancaires payment is disputed.\n\nEven if you plan to accept the un-refunded portion of the dispute, it’s important to provide evidence of the partial refund in your response. Include the amount and date of the refund, and even a screenshot of the refund information from your Dashboard (this is known as a “credit issued” response).\n\nIn most cases, the card issuer cancels the original dispute and then creates a separate one for the corrected amount. On Stripe, we use the existing dispute to track the overall outcome. If the dispute is fully resolved in your favor, you receive the entire amount back. If it’s not, you only receive the partially refunded amount. In this case, the dispute’s `status` is set to `lost`.",

Do not save AccountSessions to your database as they expire relatively quickly, and cannot be used more than once.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect embedded components](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-connect-embedded-components)\n\n## [Application Fees](https://docs.stripe.com/api/application_fees)\n\nWhen you collect a transaction fee on top of a charge made for your user (using [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)), an `Application Fee` object is created in your account. You can list, retrieve, and refund application fees.\n\nRelated guide: [Collecting application fees](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges#collect-fees)\n\n## [Country Specs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/country_specs)\n\nStripe needs to collect certain pieces of information about each account created. These requirements can differ depending on the account’s country. The Country Specs API makes these rules available to your integration.\n\nYou can also view the information from this API call as [an online guide](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information).\n\n## [Person](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/create)[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/update)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/retrieve)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/list)[DELETE/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/delete)\n\n## [Transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/transfers)\n\nA `Transfer` object is created when you move funds between Stripe accounts as part of Connect.\n\nBefore April 6, 2017, transfers also represented movement of funds from a Stripe account to a card or bank account. This behavior has since been split out into a [Payout](#payout_object) object, with corresponding payout endpoints. For more information, read about the [transfer/payout split](https://docs.stripe.com/transfer-payout-split).\n\nRelated guide: [Creating separate charges and transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n\n## [Secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/secret_management)\n\nSecret Store is an API that allows Stripe Apps developers to securely persist secrets for use by UI Extensions and app backends.\n\nThe primary resource in Secret Store is a `secret`. Other apps can’t view secrets created by an app. Additionally, secrets are scoped to provide further permission control.\n\nAll Dashboard users and the app backend share `account` scoped secrets. Use the `account` scope for secrets that don’t change per-user, like a third-party API key.\n\nA `user` scoped secret is accessible by the app backend and one specific Dashboard user.

For example, WisePOS E is a TerminalHardwareProduct and a WisePOS E - US and WisePOS E - UK are TerminalHardwareSKUs.\n\n## [Terminal Hardware SKU](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_skus)Preview feature\n\nA TerminalHardwareSKU represents a SKU for Terminal hardware. A SKU is a representation of a product available for purchase, containing information such as the name, price, and images.\n\n## [Transaction Entries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/transaction_entries)\n\nTransactionEntries represent individual units of money movements within a single [Transaction](#transactions).\n\n## [Scheduled Queries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/sigma/scheduled_queries)\n\nIf you have [scheduled a Sigma query](https://docs.stripe.com/sigma/scheduled-queries), you’ll receive a `sigma.scheduled_query_run.created` webhook each time the query runs. The webhook contains a `ScheduledQueryRun` object, which you can use to retrieve the query results.\n\n## [Report Types](https://docs.stripe.com/api/reporting/report_type)\n\nThe Report Type resource corresponds to a particular type of report, such as the “Activity summary” or “Itemized payouts” reports. These objects are identified by an ID belonging to a set of enumerated values. See [API Access to Reports documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/reporting/statements/api) for those Report Type IDs, along with required and optional parameters.\n\nNote that certain report types can only be run based on your live-mode data (not test-mode data), and will error when queried without a [live-mode API key](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#test-live-modes).\n\n## [Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/financial_connections/sessions)\n\nA Financial Connections Session is the secure way to programmatically launch the client-side Stripe.js modal that lets your users link their accounts.\n\n## [Verification Report](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_reports)\n\nA VerificationReport is the result of an attempt to collect and verify data from a user. The collection of verification checks performed is determined from the `type` and `options` parameters used. You can find the result of each verification check performed in the appropriate sub-resource: `document`, `id_number`, `selfie`.\n\nEach VerificationReport contains a copy of any data collected by the user as well as reference IDs which can be used to access collected images through the [FileUpload](https://docs.stripe.com/api/files) API. To configure and create VerificationReports, use the [VerificationSession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_sessions) API.\n\nRelated guide: [Accessing verification results](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verification-sessions#results).\n\n## [Crypto Onramp Quotes](https://docs.stripe.com/api/crypto/onramp_quotes)\n\nCrypto Onramp Quotes are estimated quotes for onramp conversions into all the different cryptocurrencies on different networks. The Quotes API allows you to display quotes in your product UI before directing the user to the onramp widget.\n\nRelated guide: [Quotes API](https://docs.stripe.com/crypto/quotes-api)\n\n## [Climate Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/climate/product)\n\nA Climate product represents a type of carbon removal unit available for reservation. You can retrieve it to see the current price and availability.\n\n## [Forwarding Request](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/request)\n\nInstructs Stripe to make a request on your behalf using the destination URL. The destination URL is activated by Stripe at the time of onboarding. Stripe verifies requests with your credentials provided during onboarding, and injects card details from the payment\\_method into the request.\n\nStripe redacts all sensitive fields and headers, including authentication credentials and card numbers, before storing the request and response data in the forwarding Request object, which are subject to a 30-day retention period.\n\nYou can provide a Stripe idempotency key to make sure that requests with the same key result in only one outbound request. The Stripe idempotency key provided should be unique and different from any idempotency keys provided on the underlying third-party request.\n\nForwarding Requests are synchronous requests that return a response or time out according to Stripe’s limits.\n\nRelated guide: [Forward card details to third-party API endpoints](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/forwarding).\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/create)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/retrieve)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/list)",

  "markdown": "# Accept meses sin intereses card payments\n\n## Learn how to accept credit card payments using meses sin intereses across a variety of Stripe products.\n\nInstallments (meses sin intereses) is a feature of consumer credit cards in Mexico that allows customers to split purchases over multiple billing statements. You receive payment as if it were a normal one-time charge, with fees deducted, and the customer’s bank handles collecting the money over time.\n\nSome restrictions apply to which transactions and cards can use installments. Review the [compatibility requirements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/mx-installments#requirements).\n\nAccepting an installment payment incurs [an additional fee](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/mx-installments#fees) to the standard credit card transaction fee.\n\nYou can enable installments across a variety of Stripe products. Choose the instructions below matching your implementation.\n\n## Integrate with Checkout ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nYou can accept installments with [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout).\n\nCheckout creates a secure, Stripe-hosted payment page that lets you collect payments quickly. It works across devices and can help increase your conversion. Checkout provides a low-code way to get started accepting payments.\n\nYour customers use Checkout to pay with cards (with or without installments) and other payment methods that support Checkout.\n\n## Enable installments with the Checkout Sessions API ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nStripe Checkout allows you to collect installment payments. You can use this [integration guide](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/quickstart) to set up Checkout. After you set up Checkout, you can use it to enable installments by following the instructions below.\n\n1.  [Review Checkout documentation](#review-checkout-docs)\n2.  [Create a new Checkout session](#create-new-session)\n3.  [Select an Installment plan on the client](#select-plan)\n4.  [Retrieve the selected Installment plan](#retrieve-plan)\n\n[](#create-new-session)\n\nCreate a new Checkout session with installments enabled as shown in the example below. You need to substitute your own API key and price object.\n\n#### Note\n\nInstallments only works with `payment` mode, not `setup` or `subscription` mode.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/checkout/sessions \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\   --data-urlencode success_url=\"https://example.com/success\" \\   --data-urlencode cancel_url=\"https://example.com/cancel\" \\   -d \"line_items[0][price]\"={{PRICE_ID}} \\   -d \"line_items[0][quantity]\"=3 \\  -d mode=payment \\  -d \"payment_method_options[card][installments][enabled]\"=true`\n\n[](#select-plan)\n\nThe hosted Checkout page displays the available installment options based on the credit card number provided by the customer.\n\nIf a customer clicks on **Pay in installments (meses sin intereses)**, the installment plan option selected by default is the first plan on the list.\n\nThe customer can select their desired installment option using the Checkout interface.\n\n#### Note\n\nInstallment plans only show up for credit cards that support them and for transactions that have a total amount greater than or equal to 300.00 MXN.\n\nIn [test mode](https://docs.stripe.com/test-mode \"test mode\"), you can [use test card numbers](#testing) to test different behaviors.\n\n[](#retrieve-plan)\n\nThe selected installment plan is available through both Dashboard and API. In the Dashboard, click on a payment and scroll down to **Payment details**. If the transaction used installments, you’ll see the length of the plan…\n\nThe selected installment plan is also available on the Payment Intent. After the user has completed payment, get the payment intent ID from the Checkout Session object (for example, `\"payment_intent\": \"pi_...\"`) and then use that payment intent ID to retrieve the PaymentIntent object to see which installment plan the customer selected.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/checkout/sessions/{{CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}} \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\"`\n\nWith the payment intent ID, retrieve the PaymentIntent object:\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/payment_intents/{{PAYMENT_INTENT_ID}} \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\"`\n\nThe PaymentIntent object then shows the selected installment plan:\n\n`{   \"id\": \"pi_...\",   \"object\": \"payment_intent\",   \"amount\": 100000, ...   \"charges\": {     \"data\": [       {         \"id\": \"ch_...\",         \"object\": \"charge\",         \"amount\": 100000,         \"payment_method_details\": {           \"card\": {             \"installments\": {               \"plan\": {                 \"count\": 3,`\n\nAt this point, you’ve successfully used the Checkout Sessions API to accept payments using installments. For more information on setting up Checkout, review the [Checkout integration guide](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/quickstart). For more information on the installments API setup, review the instructions for integrating with the [Payment Intents API](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents \"Payment Intents API\"). You might also find useful information in the [Checkout Sessions](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions) and [Payment Intents](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object) API docs.\n\n## Custom settings ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nYou can customize your installments configuration using the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) payment methods settings page.\n\nYou can find the option to enable or disable installments in your [payment methods settings page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods). This setting allows you to enable installments for no-code payment methods, including Payment Links and Checkout.\n\nSeparately, on the payment methods settings page, you can also configure the specific monthly plans you want to offer and the minimum and maximum transaction amounts for each plan. These plan configurations apply to all of your existing installments integrations.\n\n## Test the integration ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nYou can use the following cards to test your integration:\n\n| Number | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n|     | 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 month installment plans available |\n|     | No installment plans available. |",

If that doesn’t work, you can submit evidence to help us resolve the dispute in your favor. You can do this in your [dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/disputes), but if you prefer, you can use the API to submit evidence programmatically.\n\nDepending on your dispute type, different evidence fields will give you a better chance of winning your dispute. To figure out which evidence fields to provide, see our [guide to dispute types](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/categories).\n\n### Parameters\n\n*   Evidence to upload, to respond to a dispute. Updating any field in the hash will submit all fields in the hash for review. The combined character count of all fields is limited to 150,000.\n    \n*   Set of [key-value pairs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/metadata) that you can attach to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format. Individual keys can be unset by posting an empty value to them. All keys can be unset by posting an empty value to `metadata`.\n    \n*   Whether to immediately submit evidence to the bank. If `false`, evidence is staged on the dispute. Staged evidence is visible in the API and Dashboard, and can be submitted to the bank by making another request with this attribute set to `true` (the default).\n    \n\n### Returns\n\nReturns the dispute object.\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/disputes/dp_1MtJUT2eZvKYlo2CNaw2HvEv \\  -u \"sk_test_4eC39Hq...arjtT1zdp7dcsk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc:\" \\  -d \"metadata[order_id]\"=6735\n```\n\n```\n{  \"id\": \"dp_1MtJUT2eZvKYlo2CNaw2HvEv\",  \"object\": \"dispute\",  \"amount\": 1000,  \"balance_transactions\": [],  \"charge\": \"ch_1AZtxr2eZvKYlo2CJDX8whov\",  \"created\": 1680651737,  \"currency\": \"usd\",  \"evidence\": {    \"access_activity_log\": null,    \"billing_address\": null,    \"cancellation_policy\": null,    \"cancellation_policy_disclosure\": null,    \"cancellation_rebuttal\": null,    \"customer_communication\": null,    \"customer_email_address\": null,    \"customer_name\": null,    \"customer_purchase_ip\": null,    \"customer_signature\": null,    \"duplicate_charge_documentation\": null,    \"duplicate_charge_explanation\": null,    \"duplicate_charge_id\": null,    \"product_description\": null,    \"receipt\": null,    \"refund_policy\": null,    \"refund_policy_disclosure\": null,    \"refund_refusal_explanation\": null,    \"service_date\": null,    \"service_documentation\": null,    \"shipping_address\": null,    \"shipping_carrier\": null,    \"shipping_date\": null,    \"shipping_documentation\": null,    \"shipping_tracking_number\": null,    \"uncategorized_file\": null,    \"uncategorized_text\": null  },  \"evidence_details\": {    \"due_by\": 1682294399,    \"has_evidence\": false,    \"past_due\": false,    \"submission_count\": 0  },  \"is_charge_refundable\": true,  \"livemode\": false,  \"metadata\": {    \"order_id\": \"6735\"  },  \"payment_intent\": null,  \"reason\": \"general\",  \"status\": \"warning_needs_response\"}\n```\n\n## [Retrieve a dispute](https://docs.stripe.com/api/disputes/retrieve)\n\nRetrieves the dispute with the given ID.\n\n### Parameters\n\nNo parameters.\n\n### Returns\n\nReturns a dispute if a valid dispute ID was provided.

  "markdown": "# Bacs Direct Debit email notification requirements\n\n## Design and send your own Bacs Direct Debit notification emails.\n\nBacs Direct Debit requires that you notify your customers when payment details are initially collected and two days before a payment is to be collected. There are three types of Bacs Direct Debit email notifications you need to send in different scenarios:\n\n| Email | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Confirmation of signup | Sent when payment details are initially collected and payment is to be collected more than one month later |\n| Advanced notice | Sent two days before payment is to be collected, for every payment \\* |\n| Confirmation of signup incorporating Advanced notice | Sent when payment details are initially collected if the first payment is to be collected within one month of collecting the mandate |\n\n\\* If you are charging a recurring amount where both the charge amount and schedule is unchanging then only one advanced notice email is required and it must be sent before the first payment. This is often a reason why users choose to send their own Bacs email notifications: to reduce the overall number of emails they send their customers.\n\n## Approval process![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nTo send your own Bacs Direct Debit notification emails, follow these steps:\n\n1.  If you have not already opted to do so, you first need to customize your Business Display Name in the [Bacs Direct Debit settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payments#bacs_debit).\n2.  [Contact us](https://support.stripe.com/contact) with screenshots of your email designs for approval. This document lists out the requirements and gives examples to follow when designing your emails.\n3.  Turn off Stripe emails in the [Stripe Dashboard email settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/emails).\n\n## Confirmation of signup![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nBacs Direct Debit requires that the following information be included on a Confirmation of signup email notification:\n\n*   A heading advising confirmation of the setup of a Direct Debit Instruction\n*   Wording advising the payer to check the details contained in the email\n*   The payer’s account name\n*   The last 4 numbers of the payer’s account number with the leading digits masked\n*   The payer’s bank sort code\n*   Your customized Business Display Name\n*   Your contact telephone number and email address\n*   Advice of right to cancel\n*   The [mandate reference](https://docs.stripe.com/api/mandates/object#mandate_object-payment_method_details-bacs_debit-reference)\n*   The unedited [Stripe Direct Debit Guarantee](https://stripe.com/legal/bacs-direct-debit-guarantee), including the Direct Debit logo\n\nThe Confirmation of signup email must be sent as soon as you have collected payment details from your customer. Send this email when you receive the [checkout.session.completed](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-checkout.session.completed) event for a payment method of type `bacs_debit`.\n\nThe following example Confirmation of signup email for a fictional company, named Rocket Rides, can be used as a reference for creating your own email:\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/bacs-customized-mandate-confirmation.b05c81230fef01460f71ab1a529f7238.png)\n\n## Advanced notice![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nBacs Direct Debit requires that the following information be included on an Advanced notice email notification:\n\n*   The total amount of the Direct Debit to be debited from the payer’s account\n*   The Direct Debit due date (day, month, and year) — this will be two business days after the PaymentIntent is created in Stripe\n*   The Frequency of Direct Debit collection — only required when charging an unchanging, recurring amount and you will not be sending an advanced notice email for each charge\n*   The [mandate reference](https://docs.stripe.com/api/mandates/object#mandate_object-payment_method_details-bacs_debit-reference)\n*   Your customized Business Display Name\n*   Your contact telephone number and email address\n\nThe Advanced notice email must be sent two days before you charge your customer. Send this email when you receive a [payment\\_intent.processing](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-payment_intent.processing) event with a payment method of type `bacs_debit`. If you are collecting a mandate and payment at the same time, and have opted not to send the combined Confirmation of signup incorporating an Advanced notice email, then you must wait until the mandate is accepted to send the Advanced notice email. A mandate is accepted when you receive a [mandate.updated](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types#event_types-mandate.updated) event with a [payment\\_method\\_details.type](https://docs.stripe.com/api/mandates/object#mandate_object-payment_method_details-type) set to `bacs_debit` and [payment\\_method\\_details.bacs\\_debit.network\\_status](https://docs.stripe.com/api/mandates/object#mandate_object-payment_method_details-bacs_debit-network_status) updated from `pending` to `accepted`.\n\nThe following example Advanced notice email for a fictional company, named Rocket Rides, can be used as a reference for creating your own email:\n\n![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/bacs-customized-debit-initiated.531bf6868a65fee83ddd62b0519914e3.png)\n\n## Confirmation of signup incorporating an Advanced notice![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe Confirmation of signup and Advanced notice email notifications can only be sent as a single email when the first payment will be collected within one month of the mandate being collected.\n\nBacs Direct Debit requires that the following information be included on an Confirmation of signup email notification that incorporates an advanced notice:\n\n*   A heading advising confirmation of the setup of a Direct Debit Instruction and the future payment schedule\n*   Wording advising the payer to check the details contained in the email\n*   The payer’s account name\n*   The last 4 numbers of the payer’s account number with the leading digits masked\n*   The payer’s bank sort code\n*   Your customized Business Display Name\n*   Your contact telephone number and email address\n*   Advice of right to cancel\n*   The [mandate reference](https://docs.stripe.com/api/mandates/object#mandate_object-payment_method_details-bacs_debit-reference)\n*   The unedited [Stripe Direct Debit Guarantee](https://stripe.com/legal/bacs-direct-debit-guarantee), including the Direct Debit logo\n*   The total amount of the Direct Debit to be debited from the payer’s account\n*   The Direct Debit due date (day, month, and year) — this will be two business days after the PaymentIntent is created in Stripe\n*   The Frequency of Direct Debit collection — only required when charging an unchanging, recurring amount and you will not be sending an advanced notice email for each charge\n\nThe Confirmation of signup email incorporating Advanced notice must be sent as soon as you have collected payment details from your customer.

  "markdown": "# Instant Payouts for Stripe Dashboard users\n\n## Get access to your Stripe balance instantly.\n\nWith Instant Payouts, Stripe Dashboard users can access their Stripe balances immediately following a successful charge. You can request an Instant Payout any day or time, including weekends and holidays, and funds typically settle in the associated bank account within 30 minutes.\n\n## Compare Instant Payouts to standard payouts![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nInstant Payouts accelerate access to your funds, making them available as soon as funds from a card charge are successfully completed. However, Stripe assesses a fee on each Instant Payout. Any funds not accessed through Instant Payouts continue to be paid out according to your [default payout schedule](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payouts).\n\nInstant Payouts can’t use [alternative currencies](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts/alternative-currencies). For example, an Instant Payout to a Canadian business must be in CAD.\n\nFunds acquired from card payments are available for Instant Payouts as soon as the charge is complete. ACH or bank debits are only available for Instant Payouts after the payment has settled.\n\n## Request an Instant Payout![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYou can initiate Instant Payouts either manually through the Stripe Dashboard or programmatically using the Stripe APIs.\n\n1.  From the Home or Balances tab, click Pay out funds to check your available balance.\n2.  If you’re [eligible for Instant Payouts](#eligibility-and-daily-volume-limits) and have a positive balance, select a Standard or Instant manual payout.\n3.  If you haven’t added an [eligible Instant Payout method](#3managing-payout-methods), you’re prompted to do so. You only need to add a method once.\n4.  Select the amount you want to receive. You can enter up to the maximum amount available, subject to daily volume limits.\n5.  Funds are paid out immediately and arrive at your payout destination within minutes.\n\n## Eligibility and daily volume limits![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nNew Stripe users aren’t immediately eligible for Instant Payouts. Check your eligibility in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/balance/overview) or use the [Balances API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/balance/balance_retrieve).\n\nAn instant payout applies to a daily limit according to the time it’s requested. For example, if you request an instant payout at 23:58 on Tuesday and receive the funds at 00:03 on Wednesday, that payout counts toward Tuesday’s limit. Daily reset times depend on your region:\n\n*   United States and Canada: Midnight US Central Time\n*   United Kingdom: Midnight London Time\n*   Singapore: Midnight Singapore Time\n*   Australia: Midnight Sydney Time\n\nInstant Payouts observe the following daily limitations:\n\n*   You’re limited to a maximum instant payout amount per day. Check your daily volume in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/balance/overview). You can’t initiate Instant Payouts after you reach your daily limit.\n*   You’re limited to a maximum of 10 Instant Payouts per day.\n\n## Pricing![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nStripe charges Dashboard users a 1% fee for all Instant Payouts for CA, UK, and SG, and a 1.5% fee for US and AU. Each Instant Payout transaction has a minimum and maximum amount dependent on the currency.\n\n| Country | Instant Payout Minimum | Instant Payout Maximum |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| US  | 0.50 USD | 9,999 USD |\n| Canada | 0.60 CAD | 9,999 CAD |\n| Singapore | 0.50 SGD | 9,999 SGD |\n| United Kingdom | 0.40 GBP | 9,999 GBP |\n| Australia | 0.50 AUD | 9,999 AUD |\n\n## Manage payout methods![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYou must have an eligible payout account to receive Instant Payouts. Use the [External payout accounts and scheduling](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/payouts) section in the Dashboard Settings tab to manage your payout accounts.\n\n#### Debit card updates\n\nFor security reasons, you can’t edit card details. To update a card, remove it and add it as a new card.\n\n## Instant Payouts on mobile![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nIf you qualify for [Instant Payouts](#eligibility-and-daily-volume-limits) and the [Stripe Dashboard mobile app](https://support.stripe.com/questions/stripe-dashboard-mobile-app-on-iphone-and-android-(for-standard-direct-users)), you can start and monitor Standard or Instant manual payouts using the Stripe Dashboard Mobile App on your iOS or Android device. In the app, go to the **Balances** tab at the bottom of the screen. You can also click on the add icon () from any tab and choose **Pay out funds**. If your balance is positive, you’ll see an option to begin the payout process.\n\nTo get started, download the Stripe Dashboard mobile app for [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id978516833?pt=91215812&ct=stripe-docs-instant-payouts&mt=8) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.stripe.android.dashboard).",

  "markdown": "# Request a payment data import\n\n## Securely import sensitive payment data.\n\nStripe enables you to retain your existing customer and payment data when you migrate to Stripe. We work with your team and current payment provider, as needed, to securely migrate your information in a few steps:\n\n1.  [Build your Stripe integration](#build-integration).\n2.  [Request and confirm the migration details](#request-migration).\n3.  [Update your integration](#update-integration) to complete the migration.\n4.  (Optional) [Migrate subscriptions](#subscription-migrations).\n\nThis process allows you to accept and charge new customers on Stripe and continue charging your existing customers with your current processor until the migration is complete. Your customers incur no downtime. After the migration process completes, you can process all payments on Stripe.\n\nBuild and test your Stripe integration before requesting data from your current processor. This gives you plenty of time to verify and test your new integration. If you have any questions about the migration process or integrating with Stripe, [let us know](https://support.stripe.com/contact/login?email=true&topic=migrations).\n\n[](#build-integration)\n\nStripe simplifies your security requirements so that your customers don’t have to leave your site to complete a payment. This is done through a combination of client-side and server-side steps:\n\n1.  From your website running in the customer’s browser, Stripe securely collects their payment details.\n2.  Stripe responds with a representative token.\n3.  The browser submits the token to your server, along with any other form data.\n4.  Your server-side code uses that token in an API request (for example, when [creating a charge](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/charges-api)).\n\nThis approach streamlines your website’s checkout flow, while sensitive payment information never touches your server. This allows you to operate in accordance with [PCI-compliance](https://docs.stripe.com/security/guide#validating-pci-compliance) regulations, which can save you time and provide financial benefits.\n\n![Stripe's payment process flow](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/charge-workflow.6d5c025c1b1e62a53803f1908104e0a8.png)\n\nStripe’s payment process flow\n\nCompared to other payment processors, a Stripe integration can differ in the following ways:\n\n*   Your customer never leaves your website.\n*   Token creation isn’t tied to a specific product or amount.\n*   There’s no need to create a client-side key on-demand. You use a set, publishable [API key](https://docs.stripe.com/keys) instead.\n\n### Prepare your integration![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nFor all new customer tokens (not imported), implement the following:\n\n*   Use [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api#create_customer) objects to [save the card information](https://docs.stripe.com/saving-cards).\n*   Collect and tokenize customer card information with one of our recommended [payments integrations](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment/web/compare-integrations).\n*   [Create charges](https://docs.stripe.com/api#create_charge-customer) for these new customers.\n\nUsing this approach, you can accept payments from your new customers on Stripe without impacting your current customers in your existing processor during the migration process.\n\n### Integration considerations![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nDesigning your integration before you ask your payment processor to transfer data to Stripe is the most efficient way to handle imported data. Some actions you can take before requesting an import include:\n\n*   Complete your Stripe account setup.\n*   Remap customer records.\n*   Handle updates to payment information during the migration.\n*   Enable all optimizations, such as [Adaptive Acceptance](https://stripe.com/authorization#:~:text=for%20issuing%20banks.-,Adaptive%20Acceptance,-Uses%20machine%20learning), [Card Account Updater](https://stripe.com/resources/more/what-is-a-card-account-updater-what-businesses-need-to-know), and [network tokens](https://stripe.com/guides/understanding-benefits-of-network-tokens).\n\n#### Remap customer records![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nIf you prefer, you can configure your integration to [import the payment method data from prior records into existing Stripe customer objects](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/data-migrations/map-payment-data). Doing so prevents the migration from creating a new (possibly duplicate) customer in your Stripe account for each unique customer ID in the files we receive from your prior processor.\n\nAfter migrating, you might still have to update some records to correspond with the new Stripe [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers) identifier, if:\n\n*   You created the Stripe customer before migration, then we imported the payment information to update this customer record.\n*   We imported the payment information as a new customer record.\n\nFor example, customer jenny.rosen@example.com might have ID `42` in your database, corresponding to ID `1893` in your previous processor’s system, but is ID `cus_12345` in your Stripe account. In this case, you must now map your ID `42` to the Stripe ID `cus_12345` in your database. Stripe provides a post-import [mapping file](#update-integration) to help you identify required remapping.\n\n#### Handle updates to payment information ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nIf customers update their payment information with your previous processor in the window between transferring the data and completing the import, those changes are lost.\n\nUpdate your site’s process for handling updates to saved payments to prevent errors or billing issues for your customers. This includes preparations to perform a self-migration for any customer without a stored Stripe customer ID:\n\n1.  Create a new [Customer object](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/object) in Stripe for your customer.\n2.  Attach the payment method to the Customer object.\n3.  If necessary, [migrate subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/import-subscriptions-toolkit).\n\nAfter migration completes, Stripe [automatically handles card-triggered updates](https://stripe.com/blog/smarter-saved-cards), such as expiration date changes.\n\n[](#request-migration)\n\n1.  After you complete your integration and are ready to process payments on Stripe, [request your payment data from your previous processor](https://support.stripe.com/questions/request-data-from-a-current-processor-for-a-data-import-to-stripe). Many processors require the account owner to request a data transfer.\n2.  Log in to your Stripe account to submit the [migration request form](https://support.stripe.com/contact/email?topic=migrations) to request your import migration.\n3.  Engage with Stripe through the authenticated email thread we create upon receipt of your migration request.\n\n#### Warning\n\nNever send sensitive credit card details or customer information directly to Stripe. If you have this data, let us know in your migration request form so we can help you securely transfer your data.\n\nStripe can import your customer billing address information and payment details. For details on migrating specific payment types, see:\n\n*   [Cards](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/data-migrations/card-imports)\n*   [ACH](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/data-migrations/ach-imports)\n*   [SEPA](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/data-migrations/sepa-imports)\n*   [Bacs](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/bacs-debit/import-data)\n*   [PADs/ACSS](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/data-migrations/pads-imports)\n\nData migrations doesn’t migrate subscriptions, but you can [recreate](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/migrate-subscriptions) them separately or import them using the [Billing Migration Toolkit](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/import-subscriptions-toolkit).\n\nYour previous processor might take a few days or several weeks to transfer the final data to Stripe. Allow for this transition time in your migration plan.\n\nAfter your previous processor transfers your data, Stripe reviews the data and identifies any problems with the import. We work with you and your previous processor to correct any issues. We then share a summary of the import for your final review and approval.\n\nAfter your approval, Stripe imports the data into your account. We create a [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api#customer_object) for each unique customer in the transferred data file, and create and attach the customer’s cards as [Card](https://docs.stripe.com/api#card_object) or [Payment Method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods/object) objects. If the transferred data specifies the customer’s default card, we set that as the customer’s [default payment method](https://docs.stripe.com/api#customer_object-default_source) for charges and [subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/create) payments.\n\nIf your Stripe account has accumulated significant customer records by the time you migrate, consider [mapping import date into existing Stripe customer objects](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/data-migrations/map-payment-data) instead of creating new Customer objects.\n\nStripe typically imports data within 10 business days of receiving the correct data from your previous processor, along with any supplementary data files you want to share with our team.\n\n[](#update-integration)\n\nAfter completing the import, Stripe sends you a choice of a CSV or JSON file that shows the mapped relationship between your current processor’s IDs and the imported Stripe object IDs. Parse this mapping file and update your database accordingly. Make sure your integration [handled any card updates](#handle-card-updates) that took place during the transition.\n\n### Post import mapping file![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nAfter you update your integration with this mapping file, you can begin charging all of your customers on Stripe.\n\n`{   \"1893\": {     \"cards\": {       \"2600\": {         \"id\": \"card_2222222222\",         \"fingerprint\": \"x9yW1WE4nLvl6zjg\",         \"last4\": \"4242\",         \"exp_month\": 1,         \"exp_year\": 2020,         \"brand\": \"Visa\"       },       \"3520\": {         \"id\": \"card_3333333333\",         \"fingerprint\": \"nZnMWbJBurX3VHIN\",         \"last4\": \"0341\",         \"exp\\_month\": 6,         \"exp\\_year\": 2021,         \"brand\": \"Mastercard\"       }     },     \"id\": \"cus_abc123def456\"   } }`\n\nThe example JSON mapping above shows:\n\n*   Imported customer ID 1893 as a new Stripe Customer with ID `cus_abc123def456`.\n*   Imported customer card ID 2600 as a new Stripe Card with ID `card_2222222222`.\n*   Imported customer card ID 3520 as a new Stripe Card with ID `card_3333333333`.\n\nStripe can import card data as [PaymentMethods](https://docs.stripe.com/api#payment_method_object) instead of Card objects if you specify it in your migration request. The following examples show the mapping files for different types of payment information imports.\n\n`old_customer_id,customer_id,old_card_id,card_id,card_fingerprint,card_last4,card_exp_month,card_exp_year,card_brand old_cus_100,cus_abc123def456,old_src_100,card_2222222222,x9yW1WE4nLvl6zjg,424242,09,2024,Visa`\n\n### Post import payment declines![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nIf a customer’s credit card is declined after you complete the migration, ask them to provide their card’s CVC number or to update their card information. Then reattempt the charge.\n\n[](#migration-pgp-key)\n\nIf you’re unfamiliar with PGP, see [GPG](http://gnupg.org/) and start by [importing a public key](http://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual.html#AEN84). After you familiarize yourself with the basics of PGP, use the following PGP key to encrypt sensitive data (such as credit card information) for PCI-compliant migration.\n\n### PGP migration key![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThis creates **FILENAME.gpg** with the following information:\n\n*   Key ID: `9C78B7620C1E99AD`\n*   Key type: `RSA`\n*   Key size: `4096 bits`\n*   Fingerprint: `AEBF 7C48 38C4 4D2F DC99 A3F9 9C78 B762 0C1E 99AD`\n*   User ID: `Stripe Import Key (PCI) <support-migrations@stripe.com>`\n\nAfter you import our key, you can encrypt files to send by running this command in your command line prompt:\n\n`gpg --encrypt --recipient 9C78B7620C1E99AD FILENAME`\n\nFor more details on providing encrypted data to Stripe, see [Upload supplementary data](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/data-migrations/supplementary-data).\n\n## See also![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n*   [Multiple accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/multiple-accounts)\n*   [Account checklist](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/checklist)",

Create a `Customer` object when your customer creates an account with your business. `Customer` objects allow for reusing payment methods and tracking across multiple payments.\n\n`curl -X POST https://api.stripe.com/v1/customers \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\"`\n\n[](#web-create-intent)\n\n#### Note\n\nA [SetupIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_intents) is an object that represents your intent to set up a customer’s payment method for future payments during a session and tracks the status of that session. Create a SetupIntent on your server with `link` and the other payment methods you want to support:\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/setup_intents \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d customer={{CUSTOMER_ID}} \\   -d \"payment_method_types[]\"=card \\  -d \"payment_method_types[]\"=link`\n\nTo see how to set up other payment methods, see the [Set up future payments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/save-and-reuse) guide.\n\n### Retrieve the client secret![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe SetupIntent includes a [client secret](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-client_secret \"PaymentIntent client secret\") that the client side uses to securely complete the payment process. You can use different approaches to pass the client secret to the client side.\n\nRetrieve the client secret from an endpoint on your server, using the browser’s `fetch` function. This approach is best if your client side is a single-page application, particularly one built with a modern frontend framework like React. Create the server endpoint that serves the client secret:\n\n`get '/secret' do   intent = # ... Create or retrieve the SetupIntent   {client_secret: intent.client_secret}.to_json end`\n\nAnd then fetch the client secret with JavaScript on the client side:\n\n`(async () => {   const response = await fetch('/secret');   const {client_secret: clientSecret} = await response.json();   // Render the form using the clientSecret })();`\n\n[](#design-your-integration)\n\nLink authenticates a customer by using their email address. Depending on your checkout flow, you have the following options: pass an email to the Payment Element, collect it directly within the Payment Element, or use the Link Authentication Element. Of these, Stripe recommends passing a customer email address to the Payment Element if available.\n\nIf _any_ of the following apply to you:\n\n*   You want a single, optimized component for email collection and Link authentication.\n*   You need to collect a shipping address from your customer.\n\nThen use the integration flow that implements these elements: the Link Authentication Element, Payment Element and optional Address Element.\n\nA Link-enabled checkout page has the Link Authentication Element at the beginning, followed by the Address Element, and the Payment Element at the end. You can also display the Link Authentication Element on separate pages, in this same order, for multi-page checkout flows.\n\n![Create a payment form using multiple Elements](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/link-with-elements.f60af275f69b6e6e73c766d1f9928457.png)\n\nCreate a payment form using multiple Elements\n\nThe integration works as follows:\n\n[](#web-collect-payment-details)\n\nNow you can set up your custom payment form with the Elements prebuilt UI components. Your payment page address must start with `https://` rather than `http://` for your integration to work. You can test your integration without using HTTPS. [Enable HTTPS](https://docs.stripe.com/security/guide#tls) when you’re ready to accept live payments.\n\nThe Link Authentication Element renders an email address input. When Link matches a customer email with an existing Link account, it sends the customer a secure, one-time code to their phone to authenticate. If the customer successfully authenticates, Stripe displays their Link-saved addresses and payment methods automatically for them to use.\n\nThis integration also creates the Payment Element, which renders a dynamic form that allows your customer to pick a payment method type. The form automatically collects all necessary payments details for the payment method type selected by the customer. The Payment Element also handles the display of Link-saved payment methods for authenticated customers.\n\n### Set up Stripe Elements ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nInstall React Stripe.js and the Stripe.js loader from the [npm public registry](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@stripe/react-stripe-js).\n\n`npm install --save @stripe/react-stripe-js @stripe/stripe-js`\n\nOn your payment page, wrap your payment form with the `Elements` component, passing the [client secret](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-client_secret) from [the previous step](#web-create-intent). ​​If you already collect the customer’s email in another part of your form, replace your existing input with the `linkAuthenticationElement​`.\n\nIf you don’t collect email, add the `linkAuthenticationElement​` to your checkout flow. You must place the `linkAuthenticationElement` before the `ShippingAddressElement` (optional if you collect shipping addresses) and the `PaymentElement` for Link to autofill Link-saved details for your customer in the `ShippingAddressElement` and `PaymentElement`. You can also pass in the [appearance option](https://docs.stripe.com/elements/appearance-api), customizing the Elements to match the design of your site.\n\nIf you have the customer’s email, pass it to the `defaultValues` option of the `linkAuthenticationElement`. This prefills their email address and initiates the Link authentication process.\n\nIf you have other customer information, pass it to the `defaultValues.billingDetails` object for the `PaymentElement`. Prefilling as much information as possible simplifies Link account creation and reuse for your customers.\n\nThen, render the `linkAuthenticationElement` and `PaymentElement` components in your payment form:\n\n`import {loadStripe} from \"@stripe/stripe-js\"; import {   Elements,   LinkAuthenticationElement,   PaymentElement, } from \"@stripe/react-stripe-js\";  const stripe = loadStripe(`\n\n`'pk_test_TYooMQauvdEDq54NiTphI7jx'`\n\n`);  // Customize the appearance of Elements using the Appearance API. const appearance = {/* ... */};  // Enable the skeleton loader UI for the optimal loading experience. const loader = 'auto';`\n\nThe `linkAuthenticationElement`, `PaymentElement`, and `ShippingAddressElement` don’t need to be on the same page. If you have a process where customer contact information, shipping details, and payment details display to the customer in separate steps, you can display each Element in the appropriate step or page. Include the `linkAuthenticationElement` as the email input form in the contact info collection step to make sure the customer can take full advantage of the shipping and payment autofill provided by Link.\n\nIf you collect your customer’s email with the Link Authentication Element early in the checkout flow, you don’t need to show it again on the shipping or payment pages.\n\n### Retrieve an email address ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nYou can retrieve the email address details using the `onChange` prop on the `linkAuthenticationElement` component. The `onChange` handler fires whenever the user updates the email field, or when a saved customer email is autofilled.\n\n`<linkAuthenticationElement onChange={(event) => {   setEmail(event.value.email); }} />`\n\n### Prefill a customer email address ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nThe Link Authentication Element accepts an email address. Providing a customer’s email address triggers the Link authentication flow as soon as the customer lands on the payment page using the `defaultValues` option.\n\n`<linkAuthenticationElement options={{defaultValues: {email: 'foo@bar.com'}}}/>`\n\n[](#web-submit-payment)\n\nUse [stripe.confirmSetup](https://docs.stripe.com/js/setup_intents/confirm_setup) to complete the setup with the details you collected. Provide a [return\\_url](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_intents/create#create_setup_intent-return_url) to this function so that Stripe can redirect users after they complete their setup. When a payment is successful, Stripe immediately redirects Link and card payments to the `return_url`.\n\n`import {loadStripe} from \"@stripe/stripe-js\"; import {   useStripe,   useElements,   Elements,   LinkAuthenticationElement,   PaymentElement,   // If collecting shipping   AddressElement, } from \"@stripe/react-stripe-js\";  const stripe = loadStripe(`\n\n`'pk_test_TYooMQauvdEDq54NiTphI7jx'`\n\n`);  const appearance = {/* ... */};  // Enable the skeleton loader UI for the optimal loading experience. const loader = 'auto';  const CheckoutPage =({clientSecret}) => (   <Elements stripe={stripe} options={{clientSecret, appearance, loader}}>     <CheckoutForm />   </Elements> );  export default function CheckoutForm() {   const stripe = useStripe();   const elements = useElements();    const handleSubmit = async (event) => {     event.preventDefault();      const {error} = await stripe.confirmSetup({       elements,       confirmParams: {         return_url: \"[https://example.com/order/123/complete](https://example.com/order/123/complete)\",       },     });      if (error) {       // handle error     }   };    return (     <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>       <h3>Contact info</h3>       <LinkAuthenticationElement />       {/* If collecting shipping */}       <h3>Shipping</h3>       <AddressElement options={{mode: 'shipping', allowedCountries: ['US']}} />       <h3>Payment</h3>       <PaymentElement />        <button type=\"submit\">Submit</button>     </form>   ); }`\n\n[](#charge-saved-payment-method)\n\nWhen you’re ready to charge your customer, use the Customer and PaymentMethod IDs to create a PaymentIntent. To find a payment method to charge, list the payment methods associated with your customer.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/payment_methods \\   -u` \n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`: \\   -d \"customer\"=\"{{CUSTOMER_ID}}\" \\   -d \"type\"=\"link\" \\   -G`\n\nWhen you have the Customer and PaymentMethod IDs, create a PaymentIntent with the amount and currency of the payment with these parameters:\n\n*   Set the value of the PaymentIntent’s [confirm](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-confirm) property to `true`, which causes confirmation to occur immediately when the PaymentIntent is created.\n*   Set [payment\\_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api#create_payment_intent-payment_method) to the ID of the PaymentMethod\n*   Set [customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api#create_payment_intent-customer) to the ID of the Customer.\n*   Set [off\\_session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/confirm#confirm_payment_intent-off_session) to `true`. This causes the PaymentIntent to send an error if authentication is required when your customer isn’t actively using your site or app.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/payment_intents \\   -u` \n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n``: \\   -d amount=1099 \\   -d currency=usd \\   # In the latest version of the API, specifying the `automatic_payment_methods` parameter is optional because Stripe enables its functionality by default.   -d \"automatic_payment_methods[enabled]\"=true \\   -d customer=\"{{CUSTOMER_ID}}\" \\   -d payment_method=\"{{PAYMENT_METHOD_ID}}\" \\   -d return_url=\"https://example.com/order/123/complete\" \\   -d off_session=true \\   -d confirm=true``\n\n[](#web-test-the-integration)\n\n#### Caution\n\nDon’t store real user data in [test mode](https://docs.stripe.com/test-mode \"test mode\") Link accounts. Treat them as if they’re publicly available, because these test accounts are associated with your publishable key.\n\nCurrently, Link only works with credit cards, debit cards, and qualified US bank account purchases. Link requires [domain registration](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/pmd-registration).\n\nYou can create test mode accounts for Link using any valid email address. The following table shows the fixed one-time passcode values that Stripe accepts for authenticating test mode accounts:\n\n| Value | Outcome |\n| --- | --- |\n| Any other 6 digits not listed below | Success |\n| 000001 | Error, code invalid |\n| 000002 | Error, code expired |\n| 000003 | Error, max attempts exceeded |\n\nFor testing specific payment methods, refer to the [Payment Element testing examples](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment?platform=web#additional-testing-resources).\n\n### Multiple funding sources![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nAs Stripe adds additional funding source support, you don’t need to update your integration. Stripe automatically supports them with the same transaction settlement time and guarantees as card and bank account payments.\n\n### Card authentication and 3D Secure![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nLink supports [3D Secure 2 (3DS2)](https://stripe.com/guides/3d-secure-2 \"3D Secure 2 (3DS2)\") authentication for card payments. 3DS2 requires customers to complete an additional verification step with the card issuer when paying. Payments that have been successfully authenticated using 3D Secure are covered by a liability shift.\n\nTo trigger 3DS2 authentication challenge flows with Link in test mode, use the following test card with any CVC, postal code, and future expiration date: .\n\nIn test mode, the authentication process displays a mock authentication page. On that page, you can either authorize or cancel the payment. Authorizing the payment simulates successful authentication and redirects you to the specified return URL. Clicking the **Failure** button simulates an unsuccessful attempt at authentication.\n\nFor more details, refer to the [3D Secure authentication page](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure).\n\n#### Note\n\nWhen testing 3DS flows, only test cards for 3DS2 will trigger authentication on Link.\n\n[](#disclose-cookies)\n\nStripe collects information on customer interactions with Elements to provide services to you, prevent fraud, and improve its services.

If you have an existing Customer object, skip this step.\n\n`curl -X POST https://api.stripe.com/v1/customers \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\"`\n\n[](#create-checkout-session)\n\nBefore you can accept Direct Debit payments, your customer must provide their bank account information and give permission to debit their account (also known as a [mandate](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/bacs-debit#mandates)) through Stripe Checkout.\n\nAdd a checkout button to your website that calls a server-side endpoint to create a Checkout Session.\n\n`<html>   <head>     <title>Checkout</title>   </head>   <body>     <form action=\"/create-checkout-session\" method=\"POST\">       <button type=\"submit\">Checkout</button>     </form>   </body> </html>`\n\nCreate a Checkout Session in `setup` mode to collect the required information. After creating the Checkout Session, redirect your customer to the [URL](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/object#checkout_session_object-url) returned in the response.\n\nWhen your customer provides their payment method details, they’re redirected to the `success_url`, a page on your website that informs them that their payment method was saved successfully. Make the Session ID available on your success page by including the `{CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}` template variable in the `success_url` as in the above example.\n\nWhen your customer clicks on your logo in a Checkout Session without providing their payment method details, Checkout redirects them back to your website by navigating to the `cancel_url`. This is usually the page on your website that the customer viewed prior to redirecting to Stripe Checkout.\n\n#### Caution\n\nDon’t rely on the redirect to the `success_url` alone for detecting payment initiation, as:\n\n*   Malicious users could directly access the `success_url` without paying and gain access to your goods or services.\n*   Customers may not always reach the `success_url` after a successful payment—they might close their browser tab before the redirect occurs.\n\n#### Note\n\nThe Bacs Direct Debit rules require that customers are sent an email notification when payment details are collected. By default, these emails are sent automatically by Stripe. You can also opt to [send your own Bacs notifications](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/bacs-debit#debit-notifications).\n\n[](#retrieve-payment-method)\n\nAfter a customer submits their payment details, retrieve the [PaymentMethod](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods) object. A [PaymentMethod](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods \"PaymentMethods\") stores the customer’s bank account information for future payments. You can retrieve the PaymentMethod synchronously using the `success_url` or asynchronously using [webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks \"webhook\").\n\nThe decision to retrieve the PaymentMethod synchronously or asynchronously depends on your tolerance for dropoff, as customers might not always reach the `success_url` after a successful payment (for example, it’s possible for them to close their browser tab before the redirect occurs). Using webhooks prevents your integration from experiencing this form of dropoff.\n\nHandle `checkout.session.completed` webhooks, which contain a Session object. To learn more, see [setting up webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks). The following example is a `checkout.session.completed` response.\n\n`{   \"id\": \"evt_1Ep24XHssDVaQm2PpwS19Yt0\",   \"object\": \"event\",   \"api_version\": \"2019-03-14\",   \"created\": 1561420781,   \"data\": {     \"object\": {       \"id\": \"cs_test_MlZAaTXUMHjWZ7DcXjusJnDU4MxPalbtL5eYrmS2GKxqscDtpJq8QM0k\",       \"object\": \"checkout.session\",       \"billing_address_collection\": null,       \"cancel_url\": \"[https://example.com/cancel](https://example.com/cancel)\",       \"client_reference_id\": null,       \"customer\": null,       \"customer_email\": null,       \"display_items\": [],       \"mode\": \"setup\",       \"setup_intent\": \"seti_1EzVO3HssDVaQm2PJjXHmLlM\",       \"submit_type\": null,       \"subscription\": null,       \"success_url\": \"[https://example.com/success](https://example.com/success)\"     }   },   \"livemode\": false,   \"pending_webhooks\": 1,   \"request\": {     \"id\": null,     \"idempotency_key\": null   },   \"type\": \"checkout.session.completed\" }`\n\nNote the value of the `setup_intent` key, which is the ID for the SetupIntent created with the Checkout Session.

This might be the result of the customer instructing their bank to amend the mandate or because of a change in the bank itself (for example, the customer changes to a different one). Stripe sends the following events when the mandate changes:\n\n| Event name | Description | Can accept payments? |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `mandate.updated` | Occurs whenever a mandate is rejected, canceled, or reactivated by the Bacs network.

Along with a dispute ID, each row contains an associated charge ID, the amount, and the outcome of the ZIP and CVC checks.\n\n`select   date_format(date_trunc('day', disputes.created), '%m-%d-%Y') as day,   disputes.id,   disputes.charge_id,   disputes.amount,   charges.card_address_zip_check as zip,   charges.card_cvc_check as cvc from disputes inner join charges on charges.id=disputes.charge_id where disputes.status = 'lost' and disputes.reason = 'fraudulent' order by day desc limit 5`\n\n| day | id  | charge\\_id | amount | zip | cvc |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 7/12/2024 | dp\\_ql1JydyICDzQdIN | ch\\_1aUtynRz8NHZFZE | 1,000 |     | pass |\n| 7/12/2024 | dp\\_k3jODII6SYhwcuF | ch\\_PM01uQfmU1rkaRX | 1,000 | pass | fail |\n| 7/12/2024 | dp\\_AINyCojwEdlMuEW | ch\\_TBIr7SeMSwznLDB | 1,000 | fail | fail |\n| 7/12/2024 | dp\\_SBtr2BTAXnuPn7U | ch\\_8xbnI8BXrqZiQ3c | 1,000 |     | pass |\n| 7/12/2024 | dp\\_pm2F8yBXsbUpO27 | ch\\_ib33xzxnayfOc0q | 1,000 |     | pass |\n\nUsing Sigma or Data Pipeline to create reports about your disputes can help you identify fraudulent payments, which you can prevent by using [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar \"Radar\").\n\n## Radar for Fraud Teams Data![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nIf you use Radar for Fraud Teams, you have a table `radar_rules` that contains all Radar custom rules with their action and predicate. You can use this to obtain the `rule_id` which can then be used in `rule_decisions` table to find all charges affected by rules. This is more flexible than looking at the `outcome_rule_id` attribute in the `charges` table, as it also shows 3DS Rules triggered for Payment Intents and Setup Intents. Radar’s [built-in rules](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/rules#built-in-rules) have fixed rule IDs.\n\nThe following example shows recent payments allowed by an allow-list and their Radar score to check if potentially fraudulent payments were allowed:\n\n`select   outcome_type,   card_cvc_check,   count(*) as cnt,   avg(outcome_risk_score) as avg_risk_score from   charges where   outcome_rule_id = 'allow_if_in_allowlist'   and created >= current_date - interval '14' day group by   1,   2`\n\n### Platform data![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nMultiparty payment businesses such as Connect platforms have [particular risk management requirements](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/risk-management). Here’s an example of listing [destination charge](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges) businesses on your platform by their dispute rate:\n\n`select   m.value as merchant_external_account_id,   c.destination_id,   arbitrary(a.business_name) as destination_name,   count(*) as cnt_charges,   count_if(c.paid) as cnt_success_charges,   count_if(c.paid) * 1.0 / count(*) as success_rate,   if(     count_if(dispute_id is not null) > 0,     count_if(c.paid) * 1.0 / count_if(c.paid),     0.0   ) as dispute_rate from   charges c   left join charges_metadata m on m.charge_id = c.id   and m.key = 'merchant_external_account_id'   join connected_accounts a on a.id = c.destination_id where   c.created >= current_date - interval '120' day group by   1,2 order by dispute_rate desc`\n\n### 3D Secure Data![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nSigma and Data Pipelines contains data on 3D Secure Authentication ([3DS](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure \"3D Secure (3DS)\")). This more complex example shows for each 3DS Rule how many times it triggered 3DS and what the outcomes were, considering there might be more than one attempt:\n\n`select   rd.rule_id,   count(distinct rd.id) as cnt_rule_triggered,   count(distinct rd.payment_intent_id) * 1.0 / count(distinct rd.id) * 100.0 as pct_pis,   count_if(at.is_final_attempt) * 1.0 / count(distinct rd.id) * 100.0 as pct_final_attempts,   count_if(     at.is_final_attempt     and at.threeds_outcome_result = 'authenticated'   ) * 1.0 / count(distinct rd.id) * 100.0 as pct_3ds_final_authenticated,   count_if(     at.threeds_outcome_result = 'authenticated'     and at.charge_outcome = 'authorized'   ) * 1.0 / count(distinct rd.id) * 100.0 as pct_3ds_authorized from   rule_decisions rd   left join authentication_report_attempts at on at.intent_id = rd.payment_intent_id where   action = 'request_credentials'   and rd.created >= current_date - interval '30' day group by   1`\n\n### All Radar Rule Attributes and Decisions![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYou also have access to the `radar_rule_attributes` table. Each row contains most of the [Radar rule attribute](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/rules/reference#supported-attributes) values for a single [charge](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/object). You can join the `radar_rule_attributes` and `disputes` tables together using the `radar_rule_attributes.transaction_id` and `disputes.charge_id` columns, which allows you to write rules targeting your disputes and understand trends in your good and bad customers.\n\n`select   card_3d_secure_support,   is_3d_secure_authenticated,   cvc_check,   avg(risk_score) as avg_risk_score,   avg(total_charges_per_card_number_all_time) as avg_total_charges_per_card_number_all_time,   count(*) as cnt_disputes from   radar_rule_attributes r   join disputes d on r.transaction_id = d.charge_id where   d.created >= current_date - interval '60' day group by   1,2,3 order by   cnt_disputes desc`\n\nFor more details on columns available see our guide on [How to continuously improve your fraud management with Radar for Fraud Teams and Stripe Data](https://stripe.com/guides/improve-fraud-management-with-radar-for-fraud-teams-and-stripe-data). It explains, for instance, where to find Radar scores per Charges and so on.\n\n## Tracking Monitoring Programs![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n[Card brand monitoring program](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/monitoring-programs) metrics are difficult to track because rules are very specific. Some details are crucial, such as when to use volume or transaction count. Tracking them is required to estimate fraud and chargeback levels and take action promptly, because monitoring program notifications don’t happen immediately. We recommend a [continous process](https://stripe.com/guides/improve-fraud-management-with-radar-for-fraud-teams-and-stripe-data) to track and estimate chargeback and fraud metrics.\n\nWith Sigma, you can write a query to estimate fraud levels that simulate how card monitoring programs might assess your payments. The query below isn’t perfect (for example, we assume this is a US merchant where domestic and cross-border payments are counted, but you can adjust the query for your use case). Most importantly, it takes FX (currency exchange rates) into account, and applies the same method of counting payment and fraud periods independently as the monitoring programs typically do.\n\n`with exchange_rates as (   select     date,     currency,     rate   from     exchange_rates_from_usd     cross join unnest (       cast(         json_parse(buy_currency_exchange_rates) as map(varchar, double)       )     ) as t(currency, rate)   where     date = (       select         max(date)       from         exchange_rates_from_usd     ) -- note the calculation for jpy is decimal and may look off ), payments as (   select     -- technically these values are calculated per statement descriptor for CNP but we assume this equals merchant     date_format(p.captured_at, '%Y-%m-01') as start_of_month,     if(       p.card_brand = 'Visa'       or p.card_brand = 'MasterCard',       p.card_brand,       'Other'     ) as network,     count(*) as sales_count,     -- For US, both Cross-Border and Domestic charges are counted     -- we can ignore this in CBMP but show it here just to get a magnitude     count_if(p.card_country != 'US') as sales_count_crossborder,     count_if(pmd.card_3ds_succeeded) as sales_count_3ds,     sum(p.amount / fx.rate / 100.0) as sales_volume_usd,     sum(       if(         p.card_country != 'US',         p.amount / fx.rate / 100.0       )     ) as sales_volume_crossborder_usd,     sum(       if(         p.card_country = 'US'         and pmd.card_3ds_succeeded,         p.amount / fx.rate / 100.0       )     ) as sales_volume_3ds_us_usd   from     charges p     join exchange_rates fx on p.currency = fx.currency     left join payment_method_details pmd on pmd.charge_id = p.id     -- for more information you may use     -- left join authentication_report_attempts aa on attempt_id intent_id   where     p.captured_at >= date_trunc('month', current_date -

By visiting the session’s URL, the customer can manage their subscriptions and billing details. For security reasons, sessions are short-lived and will expire if the customer does not visit the URL. Create sessions on-demand when customers intend to manage their subscriptions and billing details.\n\nRelated guide: [Customer management](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management)\n\n## [Invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices)\n\nInvoices are statements of amounts owed by a customer, and are either generated one-off, or generated periodically from a subscription.\n\nThey contain [invoice items](#invoiceitems), and proration adjustments that may be caused by subscription upgrades/downgrades (if necessary).\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed through automatic charges, Stripe automatically finalizes your invoice and attempts payment. Note that finalizing the invoice, [when automatic](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/automatic-advancement-collection), does not happen immediately as the invoice is created. Stripe waits until one hour after the last webhook was successfully sent (or the last webhook timed out after failing). If you (and the platforms you may have connected to) have no webhooks configured, Stripe waits one hour after creation to finalize the invoice.\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed by sending an email, then based on your [email settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/billing/automatic), Stripe will email the invoice to your customer and await payment. These emails can contain a link to a hosted page to pay the invoice.\n\nStripe applies any customer credit on the account before determining the amount due for the invoice (i.e., the amount that will be actually charged). If the amount due for the invoice is less than Stripe’s [minimum allowed charge per currency](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts), the invoice is automatically marked paid, and we add the amount due to the customer’s credit balance which is applied to the next invoice.\n\nMore details on the customer’s credit balance are [here](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/customer/balance).\n\nRelated guide: [Send invoices to customers](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/invoices/sending)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create)[POST/v1/invoices/create\\_preview](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create_preview)[POST/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/lines/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_line)[GET/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/retrieve)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming)[GET/v1/invoices/:id/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming_invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/list)[DELETE/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/delete)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/add\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/add_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/remove\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/remove_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/update\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/finalize](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/finalize)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/mark\\_uncollectible](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/mark_uncollectible)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/pay](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/pay)[GET/v1/invoices/search](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/search)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/send](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/send)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/void](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/void)\n\n## [Meter Events](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event)\n\nA billing meter event represents a customer’s usage of a product. Meter events are used to bill a customer based on their usage. Meter events are associated with billing meters, which define the shape of the event’s payload and how those events are aggregated for billing.\n\n## [Meter Event Adjustment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_adjustment)\n\nA billing meter event adjustment is a resource that allows you to cancel a meter event. For example, you might create a billing meter event adjustment to cancel a meter event that was created in error or attached to the wrong customer.\n\n## [Meter Event Summary](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_summary)\n\nA billing meter event summary represents an aggregated view of a customer’s billing meter events within a specified timeframe. It indicates how much usage was accrued by a customer for that period.\n\n## [Plans](https://docs.stripe.com/api/plans)\n\nYou can now model subscriptions more flexibly using the [Prices API](#prices). It replaces the Plans API and is backwards compatible to simplify your migration.\n\nPlans define the base price, currency, and billing cycle for recurring purchases of products. [Products](#products) help you track inventory or provisioning, and plans help you track pricing. Different physical goods or levels of service should be represented by products, and pricing options should be represented by plans. This approach lets you change prices without having to change your provisioning scheme.\n\nFor example, you might have a single “gold” product that has plans for $10/month, $100/year, €9/month, and €90/year.\n\nRelated guides: [Set up a subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/set-up-subscription) and more about [products and prices](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/overview).\n\n## [Tax IDs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_create)[POST/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/create)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_retrieve)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/retrieve)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_list)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/list)[DELETE/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_delete)[DELETE/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/delete)\n\n## [Account Links](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_links)\n\nAccount Links are the means by which a Connect platform grants a connected account permission to access Stripe-hosted applications, such as Connect Onboarding.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect Onboarding](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom/hosted-onboarding)\n\n## [Account Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_sessions)\n\nAn AccountSession allows a Connect platform to grant access to a connected account in Connect embedded components.\n\nWe recommend that you create an AccountSession each time you need to display an embedded component to your user. Do not save AccountSessions to your database as they expire relatively quickly, and cannot be used more than once.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect embedded components](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-connect-embedded-components)\n\n## [Application Fees](https://docs.stripe.com/api/application_fees)\n\nWhen you collect a transaction fee on top of a charge made for your user (using [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)), an `Application Fee` object is created in your account. You can list, retrieve, and refund application fees.\n\nRelated guide: [Collecting application fees](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges#collect-fees)\n\n## [Country Specs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/country_specs)\n\nStripe needs to collect certain pieces of information about each account created. These requirements can differ depending on the account’s country. The Country Specs API makes these rules available to your integration.\n\nYou can also view the information from this API call as [an online guide](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information).\n\n## [Person](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/create)[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/update)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/retrieve)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/list)[DELETE/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/delete)\n\n## [Transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/transfers)\n\nA `Transfer` object is created when you move funds between Stripe accounts as part of Connect.\n\nBefore April 6, 2017, transfers also represented movement of funds from a Stripe account to a card or bank account. This behavior has since been split out into a [Payout](#payout_object) object, with corresponding payout endpoints. For more information, read about the [transfer/payout split](https://docs.stripe.com/transfer-payout-split).\n\nRelated guide: [Creating separate charges and transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n\n## [Secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/secret_management)\n\nSecret Store is an API that allows Stripe Apps developers to securely persist secrets for use by UI Extensions and app backends.\n\nThe primary resource in Secret Store is a `secret`. Other apps can’t view secrets created by an app. Additionally, secrets are scoped to provide further permission control.\n\nAll Dashboard users and the app backend share `account` scoped secrets. Use the `account` scope for secrets that don’t change per-user, like a third-party API key.\n\nA `user` scoped secret is accessible by the app backend and one specific Dashboard user. Use the `user` scope for per-user secrets like per-user OAuth tokens, where different users might have different permissions.\n\nRelated guide: [Store data between page reloads](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/store-auth-data-custom-objects)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[GET/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/list)[POST/v1/apps/secrets/delete](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/delete)[GET/v1/apps/secrets/find](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/find)[POST/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/set)\n\n## [Reviews](https://docs.stripe.com/api/radar/reviews)\n\nReviews can be used to supplement automated fraud detection with human expertise.\n\nLearn more about [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar) and reviewing payments [here](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/reviews).\n\n## [Authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/update)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/list)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/approve](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/approve)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/decline](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/decline)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_create)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/capture](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_capture)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/expire](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_expire)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/finalize\\_amount](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_finalize_amount)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/increment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_increment)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/fraud\\_challenges/respond](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/respond_to_fraud_challenges)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/reverse](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_reverse)\n\n## [Cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/create)[POST/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/update)[GET/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/list)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/deliver](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_deliver)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/fail](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_fail)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/return](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_return)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/ship](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_ship)\n\n## [Physical Bundles](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/physical_bundles)\n\nA Physical Bundle represents the bundle of physical items -

For example, WisePOS E is a TerminalHardwareProduct and a WisePOS E - US and WisePOS E - UK are TerminalHardwareSKUs.\n\n## [Terminal Hardware SKU](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_skus)Preview feature\n\nA TerminalHardwareSKU represents a SKU for Terminal hardware. A SKU is a representation of a product available for purchase, containing information such as the name, price, and images.\n\n## [Transaction Entries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/transaction_entries)\n\nTransactionEntries represent individual units of money movements within a single [Transaction](#transactions).\n\n## [Scheduled Queries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/sigma/scheduled_queries)\n\nIf you have [scheduled a Sigma query](https://docs.stripe.com/sigma/scheduled-queries), you’ll receive a `sigma.scheduled_query_run.created` webhook each time the query runs. The webhook contains a `ScheduledQueryRun` object, which you can use to retrieve the query results.\n\n## [Report Types](https://docs.stripe.com/api/reporting/report_type)\n\nThe Report Type resource corresponds to a particular type of report, such as the “Activity summary” or “Itemized payouts” reports. These objects are identified by an ID belonging to a set of enumerated values. See [API Access to Reports documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/reporting/statements/api) for those Report Type IDs, along with required and optional parameters.\n\nNote that certain report types can only be run based on your live-mode data (not test-mode data), and will error when queried without a [live-mode API key](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#test-live-modes).\n\n## [Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/financial_connections/sessions)\n\nA Financial Connections Session is the secure way to programmatically launch the client-side Stripe.js modal that lets your users link their accounts.\n\n## [Verification Report](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_reports)\n\nA VerificationReport is the result of an attempt to collect and verify data from a user. The collection of verification checks performed is determined from the `type` and `options` parameters used. You can find the result of each verification check performed in the appropriate sub-resource: `document`, `id_number`, `selfie`.\n\nEach VerificationReport contains a copy of any data collected by the user as well as reference IDs which can be used to access collected images through the [FileUpload](https://docs.stripe.com/api/files) API. To configure and create VerificationReports, use the [VerificationSession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_sessions) API.\n\nRelated guide: [Accessing verification results](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verification-sessions#results).\n\n## [Crypto Onramp Quotes](https://docs.stripe.com/api/crypto/onramp_quotes)\n\nCrypto Onramp Quotes are estimated quotes for onramp conversions into all the different cryptocurrencies on different networks. The Quotes API allows you to display quotes in your product UI before directing the user to the onramp widget.\n\nRelated guide: [Quotes API](https://docs.stripe.com/crypto/quotes-api)\n\n## [Climate Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/climate/product)\n\nA Climate product represents a type of carbon removal unit available for reservation. You can retrieve it to see the current price and availability.\n\n## [Forwarding Request](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/request)\n\nInstructs Stripe to make a request on your behalf using the destination URL. The destination URL is activated by Stripe at the time of onboarding. Stripe verifies requests with your credentials provided during onboarding, and injects card details from the payment\\_method into the request.\n\nStripe redacts all sensitive fields and headers, including authentication credentials and card numbers, before storing the request and response data in the forwarding Request object, which are subject to a 30-day retention period.\n\nYou can provide a Stripe idempotency key to make sure that requests with the same key result in only one outbound request. The Stripe idempotency key provided should be unique and different from any idempotency keys provided on the underlying third-party request.\n\nForwarding Requests are synchronous requests that return a response or time out according to Stripe’s limits.\n\nRelated guide: [Forward card details to third-party API endpoints](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/forwarding).\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/create)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/retrieve)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/list)",

Upon confirmation, the PaymentIntent will attempt to initiate a payment. If the selected payment method requires additional authentication steps, the PaymentIntent will transition to the `requires_action` status and suggest additional actions via `next_action`. If payment fails, the PaymentIntent transitions to the `requires_payment_method` status or the `canceled` status if the confirmation limit is reached. If payment succeeds, the PaymentIntent will transition to the `succeeded` status (or `requires_capture`, if `capture_method` is set to `manual`). If the `confirmation_method` is `automatic`, payment may be attempted using our [client SDKs](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-js/reference#stripe-handle-card-payment) and the PaymentIntent’s [client\\_secret](#payment_intent_object-client_secret). After `next_action`s are handled by the client, no additional confirmation is required to complete the payment. If the `confirmation_method` is `manual`, all payment attempts must be initiated using a secret key. If any actions are required for the payment, the PaymentIntent will return to the `requires_confirmation` state after those actions are completed. Your server needs to then explicitly re-confirm the PaymentIntent to initiate the next payment attempt.\n\n### Parameters\n\n*   ID of the payment method (a PaymentMethod, Card, or [compatible Source](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/transitioning#compatibility) object) to attach to this PaymentIntent.\n    \n*   Email address that the receipt for the resulting payment will be sent to. If `receipt_email` is specified for a payment in live mode, a receipt will be sent regardless of your [email settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/emails).\n    \n*   Indicates that you intend to make future payments with this PaymentIntent’s payment method.\n    \n    Providing this parameter will [attach the payment method](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/save-during-payment) to the PaymentIntent’s Customer, if present, after the PaymentIntent is confirmed and any required actions from the user are complete. If no Customer was provided, the payment method can still be [attached](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods/attach) to a Customer after the transaction completes.\n    \n    When processing card payments, Stripe also uses `setup_future_usage` to dynamically optimize your payment flow and comply with regional legislation and network rules, such as [SCA](https://docs.stripe.com/strong-customer-authentication).\n    \n    If `setup_future_usage` is already set and you are performing a request using a publishable key, you may only update the value from `on_session` to `off_session`.\n    \n    Possible enum values\n    \n    |     |\n    | --- |\n    | `off_session`<br><br>Use `off_session` if your customer may or may not be present in your checkout flow. |\n    | `on_session`<br><br>Use `on_session` if you intend to only reuse the payment method when your customer is present in your checkout flow. |\n    \n*   Shipping information for this PaymentIntent.\n    \n\n### More parameters\n\n*   #### \n    \n    capture\\_methodenumsecret key only\n    \n\n*   #### \n    \n    error\\_on\\_requires\\_actionboolean\n    \n*   #### \n    \n    mandatestringsecret key only\n    \n\n*   #### \n    \n    off\\_sessionboolean | stringsecret key only\n    \n*   #### \n    \n    payment\\_method\\_dataobject\n    \n*   #### \n    \n    payment\\_method\\_optionsobjectsecret key only\n    \n*   #### \n    \n    payment\\_method\\_typesarray of stringssecret key only\n    \n*   #### \n    \n    radar\\_optionsobjectsecret key only\n    \n\n### Returns\n\nReturns the resulting PaymentIntent after all possible transitions are applied.\n\nPOST /v1/payment\\_intents/:id/confirm\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/payment_intents/pi_3MtweELkdIwHu7ix0Dt0gF2H/confirm \\  -u \"sk_test_4eC39Hq...arjtT1zdp7dcsk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc:\" \\  -d payment_method=pm_card_visa \\  --data-urlencode return_url=\"https://www.example.com\"\n```\n\n```\n{  \"id\": \"pi_3MtweELkdIwHu7ix0Dt0gF2H\",  \"object\": \"payment_intent\",  \"amount\": 2000,  \"amount_capturable\": 0,  \"amount_details\": {    \"tip\": {}  },  \"amount_received\": 2000,  \"application\": null,  \"application_fee_amount\": null,  \"automatic_payment_methods\": {    \"enabled\": true  },  \"canceled_at\": null,  \"cancellation_reason\": null,  \"capture_method\": \"automatic\",  \"client_secret\": \"pi_3MtweELkdIwHu7ix0Dt0gF2H_secret_ALlpPMIZse0ac8YzPxkMkFgGC\",  \"confirmation_method\": \"automatic\",  \"created\": 1680802258,  \"currency\": \"usd\",  \"customer\": null,  \"description\": null,  \"invoice\": null,  \"last_payment_error\": null,  \"latest_charge\": \"ch_3MtweELkdIwHu7ix05lnLAFd\",  \"livemode\": false,  \"metadata\": {},  \"next_action\": null,  \"on_behalf_of\": null,  \"payment_method\": \"pm_1MtweELkdIwHu7ixxrsejPtG\",  \"payment_method_options\": {    \"card\": {      \"installments\": null,      \"mandate_options\": null,      \"network\": null,      \"request_three_d_secure\": \"automatic\"    },    \"link\": {      \"persistent_token\": null    }  },  \"payment_method_types\": [    \"card\",    \"link\"  ],  \"processing\": null,  \"receipt_email\": null,  \"review\": null,  \"setup_future_usage\": null,  \"shipping\": null,  \"source\": null,  \"statement_descriptor\": null,  \"statement_descriptor_suffix\": null,  \"status\": \"succeeded\",  \"transfer_data\": null,  \"transfer_group\": null}\n```",

  "markdown": "# Import Card Data | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\nWhen you migrate card data from your previous processor, you can import the data in Stripe as the default payment method card (`pm_`) object or a legacy card (`card_`) object. The Payment Intents API supports all Stripe products for both card payment types, but your integration might favor one based on the following considerations.\n\n*   If you’re using a third-party subscription platform with Stripe, check with the platform or your developer to see if they prefer one or the other.\n    \n*   If you have existing payment data in your Stripe account, try to match the type you’re already using:\n    \n    *   `pm_`: Use the [Payment Methods API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment-methods) in conjunction with the Payment Intents API.\n    *   `card_`: Use the [Card API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/cards) in conjunction with the Payment Intents API.\n    *   `src_`: You can still use the deprecated Sources API, but we recommend [migrating to the Payment Intents API](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents/migration/charges) for access to more features.\n\n## Default cards![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nA _default card_ is the primary card a customer sets or chooses for recurring payments, subscriptions, or as the default payment method for future transactions. When you mark a card as `default`, it automatically becomes the payment method for the next transaction unless you specify otherwise. Use this feature for subscription-based services that require automatic recurring payments. You can set a new card as the new default payment method, or add it as an additional payment method without changing the current default.\n\n| Type | Object prefix | Migration behavior |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Card | `card_` | Sets a default card on import. If unspecified in the data file, the first card imported becomes the default. |\n| Payment Method | `pm_` | Doesn’t require a default card. If unspecified in the data file, no card is the default. |\n| Source | `src_` | Doesn’t require a default card. If unspecified in the data file, no card is the default. |\n\n### Providing default card data![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n*   Include default card information in a separate column of your data file, ideally using `TRUE` and `FALSE` values to identify the default and non-default cards.\n*   Marking a card as default during import overrides an existing customer’s current default payment method, if set.\n\n## Current limitations![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nStripe can’t migrate cards stored by digital wallets such as Google and Apple because those services (not the previous provider) tokenize the stored values for security. You must add any cards associated with digital wallets as new payment methods in Stripe.\n\n## Address validation for Stripe Tax![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nWhen you migrate customer data to an account using Stripe Tax, include customer address fields for the following reasons:\n\n*   **Tax calculation accuracy**: Addresses help calculate taxes correctly in different jurisdictions.\n*   **Compliance with tax laws**: Local tax laws require addresses for tax invoice accuracy.\n*   **Audits and reporting**: Precise address data aids compliance in tax audits and enhances internal analytics by recording transaction locations.\n*   **Enhanced customer checkout**: Starting with accurate addresses improves the checkout process for repeat customers by enabling precise, automatic tax calculation.\n*   **Adaptability to tax law changes**: A full set of customer address data allows a business to adjust to tax regulation changes, preventing compliance issues.\n\n## Card Account Updater (CAU) ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nFiles from processors often contain expired cards. Stripe’s [CAU feature](https://stripe.com/resources/more/what-is-a-card-account-updater-what-businesses-need-to-know) automatically updates stored card information by retrieving and applying new card details from the issuing bank.\n\nCAU maximizes continuity of service and improves authorization rates, but might incur fees for each updated card in your account. You can specify how we handle expired cards during import.\n\n*   **Skip expired cards**: Don’t import expired card data.\n    \n    #### Note\n    \n    CAU might still update non-expired cards (such as stolen or replacement cards), triggering post-migration charges.\n    \n*   **Import expired cards**: Allow CAU to update as many cards as possible and charge CAU fees to your account.\n\n### How it works![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n![How card updating on import works](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/dm-cau.376a7292d021463b18118595e4e20e79.jpg)\n\n## Migrate proof of Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nFor European users, PSD2 (Second Payment Services Directive) mandates [Strong Customer Authentication (SCA)](https://docs.stripe.com/strong-customer-authentication) to enhance electronic payment security. SCA requires two out of three independent authentication factors for transactions:\n\n*   Something the customer knows (such as a password)\n*   Something the customer possesses (such as a mobile device)\n*   Something the customer is (such as biometric data)\n\nNetwork transaction IDs from your previous processor show that a customer authenticated a transaction using SCA with the previous processor, enabling Stripe to apply for SCA exemptions for future transactions. This makes your migration to Stripe seamless for your customers, removing their need to re-authenticate.\n\nIf your previous provider can’t supply transaction IDs, let us know in your [import request form](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/data-migrations/pan-import#request-migration) so we can offer alternative options.\n\n## Card file guidance![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n*   A processor can provide a number of different fields.\n*   We advise your processor to provide a full export of all customer and payment method data to Stripe.\n*   Stripe can filter out any unnecessary fields from the previous processor’s data as needed.\n*   Stripe can merge multiple received files if either the old customer ID or the old source ID is present in both files.\n\n### File formatting requirements![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nExport data files must meet the following data standards for us to proceed with an import:\n\n*   The file must be in CSV format.\n*   The file must be UTF-8 encoded.\n*   Delimit rows by a single newline character `\\n` (not `\\r\\n`).\n*   Delimit columns by `,`\n*   You must wrap all fields containing commas in double quotes `\"`. We recommend wrapping all fields in double quotes.\n*   Leave empty fields entirely empty (no character in between delimiters). You must _not_ denote a missing field with `NULL`, `N/A`, or any other value.\n*   Escape any double quotes that are part of the content with another double quote per the CSV RFC. For example: `\"``William` `\"\"``Bard of Avon``\"\"` `Shakespeare``\"`\n*   Fields can’t contain newline characters (`\\r` or `\\n`) within a field. Example of what to avoid: `101 1st Ave\\nApt 1`\n*   All rows must have the same number of columns.\n*   Columns support any order.\n*   You must encrypt sensitive data files with our [PGP key](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/data-migrations/pan-import#migration-pgp-key) before submitting through SFTP.\n\n## Card data fields![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n| Field | Required | Additional info |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Old customer ID | Required | We create a customer ID for each unique old customer ID provided. |\n| Card number | Required | Each customer imported must have at least one Card. |\n| Card expiry | Required | You can provide this option as one or two (separate month and year values) columns. |\n| Network Transaction IDs | Required\\* | \\*Mandatory for [SCA impacted merchants](https://support.stripe.com/questions/countries-in-the-european-economic-area-(eea)-impacted-by-strong-customer-authentication-(sca)-regulation). |\n| Address line 1 | Required\\* | \\*Recommended for address validation.

  "markdown": "# Import SEPA Data | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\nWhen you migrate SEPA data from your previous processor, you can import the data in Stripe as the default payment method card (`pm_`) object or a deprecated source (`src_`) object. The [Payment Intents API](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents) supports only `pm_` identifiers for all Stripe products, but your integration might favor one based on the following considerations.\n\n*   If you’re using a third-party subscription platform with Stripe, check with the platform or your developer to see if they prefer `pm_` or `src_` for SEPA transactions.\n*   If you have existing payment data in your Stripe account, try to match the type you’re already using:\n    *   `pm_`: Use the [Payment Methods API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment-methods) in conjunction with the Payment Intents API.\n    *   `src_`: If your existing integration already uses `src_` objects, you might benefit from importing your SEPA data to match it, and then [transitioning to the Payment Intents and Payment Methods APIs](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/transitioning).\n*   Each option has different requirements for notifications:\n    *   Payment methods issue automatic email notifications to customers when their SEPA payment method is debited, so imported data requires an email address for each payment account. You can disable automatic email notifications after migration.\n    *   Sources don’t require email addresses and you can choose to manage communication manually.\n\n## Importing the mandates![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nIn the context of SEPA, mandates refer to the original authorized agreement that the customer and the business have already established.\n\nIn Stripe, _creating a new mandate object_ doesn’t mean creating a new mandate from scratch. On import, we create a new _mandate object_ that:\n\n*   Uses the same `mandate_reference` as your original agreement.\n*   Represents the same agreement the customer initially authorized for the first direct debit instruction.\n\nNo new information is required from the customer. The original agreement stays the same.\n\n### Creditor ID![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nA SEPA Creditor Identifier (Creditor ID) is an ID associated with each SEPA Direct Debit payment that identifies the company requesting the payment. While companies might have multiple creditor identifiers, each creditor identifier is unique and allows your customers to identify the debits on their account.\n\nBy default, your Stripe account uses a Stripe Creditor ID when collecting SEPA Direct Debit Payments. **Stripe Payments** appears on bank statements alongside your configurable [Stripe statement descriptor](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/statement-descriptors). We recommend that you:\n\n*   Configure a recognizable statement descriptor to make sure customers recognize payments and to reduce the risk of disputes.\n*   Use your own Creditor ID to reduce dispute rates and improve your customer’s recognition of their payment to you.\n*   If you’re using the Stripe Creditor ID, use Stripe Checkout to collect mandates from your customers for SEPA Direct Debits.\n\nYou can configure your own Creditor ID in the [Payment Method Settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) page. When using your own Creditor ID, your name appears on statements instead of Stripe’s.\n\n#### Example SEPA Bank Mandate if using Stripe’s Creditor ID![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n`From Account Account name: CURRENT-ACCOUNT BIC: BANBICKIEXXXXX IBAN: IE11BANK11111111111111  Originator Details Originator name: Stripe Payments Europe Ltd Creditor Identifier: BE111111111111 The Creditor Identifier is a unique identifier used by the company to process collections.

They don’t need to give permission again or set up a new SEPA Direct Debit mandate. The approval you already have is sufficient.\n\n### General guidelines for communication:![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nPoint out any changes such as:\n\n*   Creditor ID if you opt for Stripe’s Creditor ID\n*   Creditor name if you opt for Stripe’s Creditor ID\n*   Recipient bank IBAN\n\nMake sure the communication reassures customers their current mandates are valid without requiring any action from them, unless they choose to cancel the mandate.\n\n## SEPA debit notification![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nSEPA rules state that you must [notify your customers](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/sepa-debit#debit-notification-emails) when debiting their SEPA payment method.\n\nYou can choose to have Stripe automatically send this email notification, or you can send it manually.\n\nTo have Stripe send the notification, make sure you include the email field in the data when importing SEPA. The email field is always a required field as part of the SEPA Payment method (`pm_`) import.\n\n## SEPA file guidance![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n*   A processor can provide a number of different fields.\n*   We advise your processor to provide a full export of all customer and payment method data to Stripe.\n*   Stripe can filter out any unnecessary fields from the previous processor’s data as needed.\n*   Stripe can merge multiple received files if either the old customer ID or the old source ID is present in both files.\n\n### File formatting requirements![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nExport data files must meet the following data standards for us to proceed with an import:\n\n*   The file must be in CSV format.\n*   The file must be UTF-8 encoded.\n*   Delimit rows by a single newline character `\\n` (not `\\r\\n`).\n*   Delimit columns by a comma (`,`).\n*   You must wrap all fields containing commas in double quotes (`\"`).

If you haven’t already, review the [migration stages](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/migrate-subscriptions#migration-stages).\n2.  [Set up a Stripe Billing integration](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/build-subscriptions) before you begin migration. This is a one-time setup that you don’t need to repeat for future migrations.\n3.  [Request a PAN data import](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/data-migrations/pan-import) from your current processor. This step is only required if you’re migrating to Stripe from another processor. If you’re migrating from Stripe to Stripe, you can skip this prerequisite.\n4.  If you’re migrating from a third-party or home-grown system, carefully time the cancellation of your existing subscriptions and the creation of new ones in Stripe. To avoid missing a billing period, create the new subscriptions in Stripe first, before canceling the old subscriptions. To avoid double billing, cancel subscriptions in your old system before the subscriptions are set to charge. For subscriptions with upcoming billing dates close to migration, schedule them to start after the cycle so the final bill is in the old system.\n\n[](#open-billing-toolkit)\n\nSelect the test-mode toggle on the top right corner if you want to run a test migration first.\n\n1.  Navigate to [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/billing) > [Subscriptions](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/subscriptions) > [**Migrations**](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/billing/migrations).\n    \n    Alternatively, you can click the overflow menu () next to **\\+ Create subscription**, and select [Migrate subscriptions](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/migrations).\n    \n2.  To start your migration, click **Let’s get started**.\n    \n\n[](#download-csv)\n\nFirst, export your existing subscriptions by matching the exported data to a migration-compatible CSV file. You can create your own CSV file, or download any of the following CSV templates provided by Stripe:\n\n*   [Basic](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/import-subscriptions-toolkit#basic)\n*   [Multi-price items](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/import-subscriptions-toolkit#multi-price)\n*   [Ad-hoc pricing](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/import-subscriptions-toolkit#ad-hoc)\n\nYou can also find examples of CSV files for common migration use cases in the [Toolkit CSV reference](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/toolkit-reference#migration-use-cases).\n\n1.  Click **Download CSV template**.\n    \n2.  Choose a CSV template (basic, multi-price items, or ad-hoc pricing) based on your billing use case.\n    \n    ### Basic CSV ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n    \n    This example shows a migration for common subscription use cases like quantity, taxes, billing anchor, discounts, trials, and backdating.\n    \n    ### Specify the following fields for a Basic CSV file:![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n    \n    ### Multi-price items CSV ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n    \n    This example shows a migration that has multiple products per subscription.\n    \n    ### Specify the following fields for a Multi-price items CSV file:![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n    \n    ### Ad-hoc prices CSV ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n    \n    This example shows handling a subscription migration using [ad-hoc pricing](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/create#create_subscription-items-price_data) for existing products.\n    \n    ### Specify the following fields for an Ad-hoc pricing CSV file:![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n    \n3.

To resolve the errors:\n\n1.  Click **Download file to review errors**.\n    \n2.  Review the `processing_error` column to see the errors.\n    \n3.  Correct all the errors. Common errors include:\n    \n    | Error | Troubleshooting |\n    | --- | --- |\n    | Invalid dates | Make sure all the dates are in epoch or Unix timestamp format. |\n    | Incorrect `start_date` range | Make sure the `start_date` for each subscription is at least 24 hours in the future. |\n    | Missing data | Make sure every record contains the required fields. |\n    | Incompatible price and tax | Make sure prices for specified tax rates have the same `tax_behavior` (inclusive versus exclusive). |\n    \n4.  Click **Upload revised file** to re-upload the corrected CSV (the CSV file size limit is 120 mb).\n    \n5.  Wait for re-validation to see the latest validation status.\n    \n\n[](#review-subscriptions)\n\nAfter Stripe validates your CSV file, review the summary of your uploaded subscriptions for any discrepancies:\n\n1.  Cross-check the summary for the correct:\n    \n    *   Date of upload\n    *   Uploaded file name\n    *   Number of subscriptions\n    *   Number of customers\n    *   First subscription go-live date\n2.  If everything is valid, click **Start migration**.\n    \n    If you see errors, click **Cancel migration** and restart the migration from [Download a CSV file](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/import-subscriptions-toolkit#download-csv).\n    \n\n[](#track-migration)\n\nAfter you review your uploaded subscriptions, track the progress of your migration:\n\n### Migration in progress![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYour subscriptions are queued to schedule on the specified start date. This process can take a few minutes to a few hours, depending on the size of the file. For example, the validation and migration for 100,000 subscriptions takes approximately 30 minutes to complete.\n\nThe Billing migration toolkit uses the [Subscription schedule](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscription_schedules) to migrate your subscriptions. This allows your subscriptions to remain in a scheduled state for 24 hours before going live. In test mode, the buffer time is reduced to 1 hour for faster evaluation and testing.\n\n### Scheduled subscriptions![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nAfter migration, your subscriptions remain in a scheduled state for 24 hours before going live. You have 10 hours to [cancel these scheduled subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/import-subscriptions-toolkit#cancel-migration) using the toolkit.\n\nCurrently, you can’t update scheduled subscriptions using the toolkit. If you want to update your scheduled subscriptions, you can either call the [update](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscription_schedules/update) endpoint, or update each subscription (one-by-one) in the [Subscriptions](https://dashboard.stripe.com/subscriptions) Dashboard.\n\nCustomers can’t cancel scheduled subscriptions from their customer portal. They can only cancel live subscriptions.\n\n### Go live with subscriptions![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nAfter 24 hours, your scheduled subscriptions go live and charge customers on their applicable start dates. You can view all your live subscriptions in the [Subscriptions](https://dashboard.stripe.com/subscriptions) Dashboard.\n\nAfter the migration goes live, we recommend you monitor your subscriptions starting from the first payment. Make sure the charge dates and amounts for the migrated subscriptions match the specified [start\\_date](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscription_schedules/create#create_subscription_schedule-start_date).\n\nCustomers can cancel live subscriptions from their customer portal.\n\n[](#view-migrations)\n\nTo view all of your migrations:\n\n1.  Select the migration you want to review in [**Migrations**](https://dashboard.stripe.com/billing/migrations).\n    \n2.  To open a migration, click **View** in the dropdown menu.\n    \n    You can track the following fields:\n    \n    *   Upload date\n    *   File name\n    *   Stripe billing migration id\n    *   Number of subscriptions\n    *   Migration status\n\n[](#cancel-migration)\n\nIf you identify any problems with the scheduled subscriptions, you can roll back the migration and revert the scheduled subscriptions. The Dashboard displays a timestamp to indicate if you can still cancel the migration using the toolkit. You have 10 hours from when you scheduled the subscriptions to cancel them. After 10 hours, the cancel option is disabled in the toolkit.\n\n1.  Find the migration you want to cancel in your [**Migrations**](https://dashboard.stripe.com/billing/migrations).\n2.  Click **Cancel migration** in the dropdown menu.\n\n### Cancel after 10 hours![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nTo cancel the migration after 10 hours, you can either call the [cancel](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscription_schedules/cancel) endpoint, or individually cancel each subscription (one-by-one) in the [**Subscriptions**](https://dashboard.stripe.com/subscriptions) Dashboard.\n\n[](#run-multiple-migrations)\n\nYou can run as many simultaneous subscription migrations as you want. For large migrations, divide the subscriptions into batches and start with a small batch. This can help you quickly identify any validation issues and save validation time.\n\nTo start a new migration:\n\n1.  Click **Start new migration**.\n    \n2.  Restart the migration process from [Download a CSV file](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/import-subscriptions-toolkit#download-csv).\n    \n    You can also find examples of CSV files for common migration use cases in the [Toolkit CSV reference](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/toolkit-reference#migration-use-cases).",

You must provide a list of validated and non-validated records.\n*   **None** of the WEB debit accounts were processed before the effective date of the Nacha WEB Debit Account Validation Rule on March 19, 2022, nor successfully validated by your previous provider. Stripe must validate these accounts. (An instant verification fee applies per bank account validation.)\n\n## How it works![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n![Shows the ACH record import process ](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/dm-ach.6b9d5e4b6efa67df8e0fa76331a1e904.jpg)\n\n## ACH emails![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nIn our [intake form](https://support.stripe.com/contact/email?topic=migrations), choose whether to import the mandates as bank account (`ba_`) or payment method (`pm_`) objects.\n\n*   If you choose bank accounts, we don’t notify your customers about the migration.\n*   If you choose payment methods and provide customer emails, we’ll automatically send your customers an email to confirm the mandate in accordance with Nacha requirements after the import. Your customers don’t need to do anything after receiving the emails.\n\n## ACH file guidance![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n*   A processor can provide a number of different fields.\n*   We advise your processor to provide a full export of all customer and payment method data to Stripe.\n*   Stripe can filter out any unnecessary fields from the previous processor’s data as needed.\n*   Stripe can merge multiple received files if either the old customer ID or the old source ID is present in both files.\n\n### File formatting requirements![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nExport data files must meet the following data standards for us to proceed with an import:\n\n*   The file must be in CSV format.\n*   The file must be UTF-8 encoded.\n*   Delimit rows by a single newline character `\\n` (not `\\r\\n`).\n*   Delimit columns by `,`\n*   You must wrap all fields containing commas in double quotes `\"`. We recommend wrapping all fields in double quotes.\n*   Leave empty fields entirely empty (no character in between delimiters). You must _not_ denote a missing field with `NULL`, `N/A`, or any other value.\n*   Escape any double quotes that are part of the content with another double quote per the CSV RFC. For example: `\"``William` `\"\"``Bard of Avon``\"\"` `Shakespeare``\"`\n*   Fields can’t contain newline characters (`\\r` or `\\n`) within a field. Example of what to avoid: `101 1st Ave\\nApt 1`\n*   All rows must have the same number of columns.\n*   Columns support any order.\n*   You must encrypt sensitive data files with our [PGP key](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/data-migrations/pan-import#migration-pgp-key) before submitting through SFTP.\n\n## ACH data fields![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n| Field | Required | Additional info |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Old customer ID | Required | We create a customer ID for each unique old customer ID provided. |\n| Routing number | Required | Must be 9 digits in length and include leading zeros. |\n| Account number | Required | Most bank account numbers have between 8 and 12 digits, though they can range from 5 to 17 digits. |\n| Account holder type | Required | Specifies `individual` or `company` as the type of business. |\n| Account type | Required | Specifies a `checking` or `savings` account.

A positive integer representing how much to charge in the [smallest currency unit](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#zero-decimal) (e.g., 100 cents to charge $1.00 or 100 to charge ¥100, a zero-decimal currency). The minimum amount is $0.50 US or [equivalent in charge currency](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts).

Most integrations do _not_ need to use `readReusableCard`. To only collect an in-person payment from a customer, use the [standard flow](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/collect-card-payment).\n\nReturns a `Promise` that resolves to an object with the following fields:\n\n*   `payment_method`: The [PaymentMethod object](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods/object), if the command succeeded.\n*   `error`: An [error](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/references/api/js-sdk#errors), if the command failed.\n\n#### Note\n\nCurrently, you can’t use Stripe Terminal to save contactless cards and mobile wallets (for example, Apple Pay, Google Pay) for later reuse.\n\n### `cancelReadReusableCard()` ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nCancels an outstanding [readReusableCard](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/references/api/js-sdk#read-reusable-card) command.\n\nReturns a `Promise` that resolves to an empty object when the command has been successfully canceled. If cancellation fails, the `Promise` resolves to an object with an [error](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/references/api/js-sdk#errors).\n\n### `setReaderDisplay(displayInfo)` ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nUpdates the reader display with [cart details](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/features/display).\n\nThis method takes a `DisplayInfo` object as input.\n\n`{   type: 'cart',   cart: {     line_items: [       {         description: string,         amount: number,         quantity: number,       },     ],     tax: number,     total: number,     currency: string,   } }`\n\nReturns a `Promise` that resolves to an empty object if the command succeeds.

If the command fails, the `Promise` resolves to an object with an [error](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/references/api/js-sdk#errors).\n\n### `setSimulatorConfiguration(configuration)` ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nSets the configuration object for the [simulated card reader](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/references/testing#simulated-reader).\n\nThis method only takes effect when connected to the simulated reader; it performs no action otherwise.\n\nThe simulated reader will follow the specified configuration only until `processPayment` is complete. At that point, the simulated reader will revert to its default behavior.\n\nNote that this method overwrites any currently active configuration object; to add specific key-value pairs to the object, make sure to use a combination of this method and `getSimulatorConfiguration`.\n\nThe configuration options available are:\n\n| Field | Values | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **testCardNumber** | Refer to the [Simulated test cards](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/references/testing#simulated-test-cards) list. | Configures the simulated reader to use a test card number as the payment method presented by the user. Use it to test different scenarios in your integration, such as payments with different card brands or processing errors like a declined charge. |\n| **testPaymentMethod** | Refer to the [Simulated test cards](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/references/testing#simulated-test-cards) list. | Serves the same purpose as `testCardNumber`, but relies on test payment methods instead. |\n| **tipAmount** | Any amount or null. | Configures the simulated reader to simulate an on-reader tip amount selected by the customer. |\n| **paymentMethodType** deprecated | *   `card_present` (default)<br>*   `interac_present` | Determine the type of payment method created by the simulated reader when `collectPaymentMethod` is called. |\n\n### `getSimulatorConfiguration()` ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nReturns the currently active configuration object.\n\nThe Stripe Terminal JavaScript SDK may overwrite this value as necessary, including (but not limited to) resetting the value after processPayment is complete, and removing unknown key-value pairs.\n\n### `collectRefundPaymentMethod(charge_id, amount, currency, options, config)` ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nBegins collecting a payment method to be refunded. The method takes two required parameters:\n\n*   `charge_id`, the ID of the charge that will be refunded.\n*   `amount`: a number that represents the amount, in cents, that will be refunded from the charge. This number must be less than or equal to the amount that was charged in the original payment.\n*   `currency`: Three-letter [ISO code for the currency](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies), in lowercase. Must be a [supported currency](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies).\n*   `options`: an optional object containing additional refund parameters.\n\n| Option | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| **refund\\_application\\_fee** | Optional, defaults to false. Connect only.<br><br>Boolean indicating whether the application fee should be refunded when refunding this charge. If a full charge refund is given, the full application fee will be refunded.

identifiable information (PII), directly from your customers in a secure manner. A token representing this information is returned to your server to use. Use our [recommended payments integrations](https://docs.stripe.com/payments) to perform this process on the client-side. This guarantees that no sensitive card data touches your server, and allows your integration to operate in a PCI-compliant way.\n\nIf you can’t use client-side tokenization, you can also create tokens using the API with either your publishable or secret API key. If your integration uses this method, you’re responsible for any PCI compliance that it might require, and you must keep your secret API key safe. Unlike with client-side tokenization, your customer’s information isn’t sent directly to Stripe, so we can’t determine how it’s handled or stored.\n\nYou can’t store or use tokens more than once. To store card or bank account information for later use, create [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api#customers) objects or [External accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/api#external_accounts). [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar), our integrated solution for automatic fraud protection, performs best with integrations that use client-side tokenization.\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_account)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_bank_account)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_card)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_cvc_update)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_person)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_pii)[GET/v1/tokens/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/retrieve)\n\n## [Cash Balance](https://docs.stripe.com/api/cash_balance)\n\nA customer’s `Cash balance` represents real funds. Customers can add funds to their cash balance by sending a bank transfer. These funds can be used for payment and can eventually be paid out to your bank account.\n\n## [Customer Portal Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customer_portal/sessions)\n\nThe Billing customer portal is a Stripe-hosted UI for subscription and billing management.\n\nA portal configuration describes the functionality and features that you want to provide to your customers through the portal.\n\nA portal session describes the instantiation of the customer portal for a particular customer. By visiting the session’s URL, the customer can manage their subscriptions and billing details. For security reasons, sessions are short-lived and will expire if the customer does not visit the URL. Create sessions on-demand when customers intend to manage their subscriptions and billing details.\n\nRelated guide: [Customer management](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management)\n\n## [Invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices)\n\nInvoices are statements of amounts owed by a customer, and are either generated one-off, or generated periodically from a subscription.\n\nThey contain [invoice items](#invoiceitems), and proration adjustments that may be caused by subscription upgrades/downgrades (if necessary).\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed through automatic charges, Stripe automatically finalizes your invoice and attempts payment. Note that finalizing the invoice, [when automatic](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/automatic-advancement-collection), does not happen immediately as the invoice is created. Stripe waits until one hour after the last webhook was successfully sent (or the last webhook timed out after failing). If you (and the platforms you may have connected to) have no webhooks configured, Stripe waits one hour after creation to finalize the invoice.\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed by sending an email, then based on your [email settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/billing/automatic), Stripe will email the invoice to your customer and await payment. These emails can contain a link to a hosted page to pay the invoice.\n\nStripe applies any customer credit on the account before determining the amount due for the invoice (i.e., the amount that will be actually charged). If the amount due for the invoice is less than Stripe’s [minimum allowed charge per currency](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts), the invoice is automatically marked paid, and we add the amount due to the customer’s credit balance which is applied to the next invoice.\n\nMore details on the customer’s credit balance are [here](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/customer/balance).\n\nRelated guide: [Send invoices to customers](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/invoices/sending)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create)[POST/v1/invoices/create\\_preview](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create_preview)[POST/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/lines/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_line)[GET/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/retrieve)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming)[GET/v1/invoices/:id/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming_invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/list)[DELETE/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/delete)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/add\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/add_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/remove\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/remove_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/update\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/finalize](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/finalize)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/mark\\_uncollectible](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/mark_uncollectible)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/pay](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/pay)[GET/v1/invoices/search](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/search)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/send](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/send)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/void](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/void)\n\n## [Meter Events](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event)\n\nA billing meter event represents a customer’s usage of a product. Meter events are used to bill a customer based on their usage. Meter events are associated with billing meters, which define the shape of the event’s payload and how those events are aggregated for billing.\n\n## [Meter Event Adjustment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_adjustment)\n\nA billing meter event adjustment is a resource that allows you to cancel a meter event. For example, you might create a billing meter event adjustment to cancel a meter event that was created in error or attached to the wrong customer.\n\n## [Meter Event Summary](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_summary)\n\nA billing meter event summary represents an aggregated view of a customer’s billing meter events within a specified timeframe. It indicates how much usage was accrued by a customer for that period.\n\n## [Plans](https://docs.stripe.com/api/plans)\n\nYou can now model subscriptions more flexibly using the [Prices API](#prices). It replaces the Plans API and is backwards compatible to simplify your migration.\n\nPlans define the base price, currency, and billing cycle for recurring purchases of products. [Products](#products) help you track inventory or provisioning, and plans help you track pricing. Different physical goods or levels of service should be represented by products, and pricing options should be represented by plans. This approach lets you change prices without having to change your provisioning scheme.\n\nFor example, you might have a single “gold” product that has plans for $10/month, $100/year, €9/month, and €90/year.\n\nRelated guides: [Set up a subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/set-up-subscription) and more about [products and prices](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/overview).\n\n## [Tax IDs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_create)[POST/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/create)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_retrieve)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/retrieve)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_list)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/list)[DELETE/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_delete)[DELETE/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/delete)\n\n## [Account Links](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_links)\n\nAccount Links are the means by which a Connect platform grants a connected account permission to access Stripe-hosted applications, such as Connect Onboarding.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect Onboarding](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom/hosted-onboarding)\n\n## [Account Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_sessions)\n\nAn AccountSession allows a Connect platform to grant access to a connected account in Connect embedded components.\n\nWe recommend that you create an AccountSession each time you need to display an embedded component to your user. Do not save AccountSessions to your database as they expire relatively quickly, and cannot be used more than once.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect embedded components](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-connect-embedded-components)\n\n## [Application Fees](https://docs.stripe.com/api/application_fees)\n\nWhen you collect a transaction fee on top of a charge made for your user (using [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)), an `Application Fee` object is created in your account. You can list, retrieve, and refund application fees.\n\nRelated guide: [Collecting application fees](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges#collect-fees)\n\n## [Country Specs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/country_specs)\n\nStripe needs to collect certain pieces of information about each account created. These requirements can differ depending on the account’s country. The Country Specs API makes these rules available to your integration.\n\nYou can also view the information from this API call as [an online guide](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information).\n\n## [Person](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/create)[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/update)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/retrieve)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/list)[DELETE/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/delete)\n\n## [Transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/transfers)\n\nA `Transfer` object is created when you move funds between Stripe accounts as part of Connect.\n\nBefore April 6, 2017, transfers also represented movement of funds from a Stripe account to a card or bank account. This behavior has since been split out into a [Payout](#payout_object) object, with corresponding payout endpoints. For more information, read about the [transfer/payout split](https://docs.stripe.com/transfer-payout-split).\n\nRelated guide: [Creating separate charges and transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n\n## [Secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/secret_management)\n\nSecret Store is an API that allows Stripe Apps developers to securely persist secrets for use by UI Extensions and app backends.\n\nThe primary resource in Secret Store is a `secret`.

Australia![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nStripe supports Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and [eftpos](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/regional?integration-country=AU#eftpos-payments) payments in Australia. All transactions must be made in Australian dollars (AUD). To accept Terminal charges in Australia, either your platform account or connected account must be in Australia.\n\n### Use locations![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nCreate [Locations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/locations/create) for your business with addresses in Australia and [associate your readers to them](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/fleet/locations-and-zones). This will ensure that they automatically download the configuration needed to properly process charges in Australia.\n\nA valid [address for a Location](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/locations/create#create_terminal_location-address) in Australia must contain the `line1`, `city`, `state`, `postal_code`, and `country` properties.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/terminal/locations \\   -u` \n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`: \\   -d \"display_name\"=\"HQ\" \\   -d \"address[line1]\"=\"1234 Victoria Street\" \\   -d \"address[city]\"=\"Melbourne\" \\   -d \"address[state]\"=\"Victoria\" \\   -d \"address[country]\"=\"AU\" \\   -d \"address[postal_code]\"=\"3000\" \\`\n\n### Reader software version![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nBBPOS WisePad 3 readers operating in Australia must use the reader software version `4.01.00.38_Prod_APAC1_on_v23_490001` or later.

More than 90% of eftpos cards are co-branded with either Visa or Mastercard, meaning you can process these cards over either network supported by the card.\n\nStripe processes co-branded eftpos cards over eftpos, Visa, or Mastercard depending on the [least cost routing requirements](https://support.stripe.com/questions/supporting-dual-network-debit-cards-in-australia) and the [type of transaction](https://docs.stripe.com/terminal/payments/regional?integration-country=AU#identify-which-network-a-payment-was-processed-on).\n\n### Availability![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nEftpos is available to any business that uses Stripe in Australia, with the following exceptions:\n\n*   Massage parlors ([MCC](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/setting-mcc) 7297)\n*   Financial institutions—manual cash disbursements ([MCC](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/setting-mcc) 6010)\n*   Financial institutions—merchandise and services ([MCC](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/setting-mcc) 6012)\n*   Non-financial institutions—foreign currency, money orders and travelers’ checks.

Unlike networks like Visa and Mastercard, eftpos doesn’t support placing a “hold” on a card and capturing the funds later. Only payments with `automatic` or `manual_preferred` capture type can be processed on eftpos.\n    \n    | Capture type | Implementation | Result |\n    | --- | --- | --- |\n    | **automatic** | Set [`​capture_method`](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-capture_method) on the payment intent to `automatic`. | All card payments will be authorized and captured in a single step. |\n    | **manual\\_preferred** | Set [`​capture_method`](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-payment_method_options-card_present-capture_method) on the nested `payment_method_options.card_present` attribute to `manual_preferred`. | eftpos card payments will be authorized and captured in a single step.<br><br>Non-eftpos card payments will be authorized only.

  "markdown": "# Verification checks | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Learn about the different verification checks supported by Stripe Identity.\n\nStripe Identity currently supports five types of verification checks: document, selfie, ID number, address, and phone.\n\nEach verification check requires different information from your user, has different coverage, and has a different verification flow. After you’ve integrated one check, you can add another with minimal changes to your integration.\n\nWhile document checks provide a defense against the use of fraudulent identity documents, it’s possible for fraudsters to get access to legitimate stolen documents. To prevent this, Stripe Identity can perform selfie checks on your users.\n\nSelfie checks look for distinguishing biological traits, such as face geometry, from a photo ID and a picture of your user’s face. Stripe then uses advanced machine learning algorithms to ensure the face pictures belong to the same person.\n\nIn some places, such as the EU, there are privacy laws that require you to justify your use of biometric technology or offer an alternative, non-biometric means of verification. We recommend you offer an alternative verification option or consult with your legal counsel.\n\nSee [Adding selfie checks](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/selfie) to learn how to add selfie checks to your app.\n\n### Availability ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nSelfie checks are available for government issued photo IDs from the following countries:\n\nAlbania\n\nAlgeria\n\nArgentina\n\nArmenia\n\nAustralia\n\nAustria\n\nAzerbaijan\n\nBahamas\n\nBahrain\n\nBangladesh\n\nBelarus\n\nBelgium\n\nBenin\n\nBolivia\n\nBrazil\n\nBulgaria\n\nCameroon\n\nCanada\n\nChile\n\nChina\n\nColombia\n\nCosta Rica\n\nCôte d’Ivoire\n\nCroatia\n\nCyprus\n\nCzech Republic\n\nDenmark\n\nDominican Republic\n\nEcuador\n\nEgypt\n\nEl Salvador\n\nEstonia\n\nFinland\n\nFrance\n\nGeorgia\n\nGermany\n\nGhana\n\nGreece\n\nGuatemala\n\nHaiti\n\nHonduras\n\nHong Kong\n\nHungary\n\nIndia\n\nIndonesia\n\nIraq\n\nIreland\n\nIsrael\n\nItaly\n\nJamaica\n\nJapan\n\nJersey\n\nJordan\n\nKazakhstan\n\nKenya\n\nKuwait\n\nLatvia\n\nLebanon\n\nLiechtenstein\n\nLithuania\n\nLuxembourg\n\nMalaysia\n\nMalta\n\nMauritius\n\nMexico\n\nMoldova\n\nMongolia\n\nMorocco\n\nMyanmar (Burma)\n\nNepal\n\nNetherlands\n\nNew Zealand\n\nNigeria\n\nNorth Macedonia\n\nNorway\n\nPakistan\n\nPalestinian Territories\n\nPanama\n\nParaguay\n\nPeru\n\nPhilippines\n\nPoland\n\nPortugal\n\nPuerto Rico\n\nRomania\n\nRussia\n\nSaudi Arabia\n\nSerbia\n\nSingapore\n\nSlovakia\n\nSlovenia\n\nSouth Africa\n\nSouth Korea\n\nSpain\n\nSri Lanka\n\nSweden\n\nSwitzerland\n\nTaiwan\n\nThailand\n\nTunisia\n\nTurkey\n\nUganda\n\nUkraine\n\nUnited Arab Emirates\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nUnited States\n\nUruguay\n\nUzbekistan\n\nVenezuela\n\nVietnam\n\n## See also![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n*   [Verify your users’ identity documents](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verify-identity-documents)\n*   [Adding selfie checks](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/selfie)\n*   [The Verification Sessions API](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verification-sessions#create)",

When this happens, you have the opportunity to respond to the dispute with evidence that shows that the charge is legitimate.\n\nRelated guide: [Disputes and fraud](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes)\n\n## [Events](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events)\n\nEvents are our way of letting you know when something interesting happens in your account. When an interesting event occurs, we create a new `Event` object. For example, when a charge succeeds, we create a `charge.succeeded` event, and when an invoice payment attempt fails, we create an `invoice.payment_failed` event. Certain API requests might create multiple events. For example, if you create a new subscription for a customer, you receive both a `customer.subscription.created` event and a `charge.succeeded` event.\n\nEvents occur when the state of another API resource changes. The event’s data field embeds the resource’s state at the time of the change. For example, a `charge.succeeded` event contains a charge, and an `invoice.payment_failed` event contains an invoice.\n\nAs with other API resources, you can use endpoints to retrieve an [individual event](#retrieve_event) or a [list of events](#list_events) from the API. We also have a separate [webhooks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook) system for sending the `Event` objects directly to an endpoint on your server. You can manage webhooks in your [account settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/webhooks). Learn how to [listen for events](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks) so that your integration can automatically trigger reactions.\n\nWhen using [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect), you can also receive event notifications that occur in connected accounts. For these events, there’s an additional `account` attribute in the received `Event` object.\n\nWe only guarantee access to events through the [Retrieve Event API](#retrieve_event) for 30 days.\n\n## [Files](https://docs.stripe.com/api/files)\n\nThis object represents files hosted on Stripe’s servers. You can upload files with the [create file](#create_file) request (for example, when uploading dispute evidence). Stripe also creates files independently (for example, the results of a [Sigma scheduled query](#scheduled_queries)).\n\nRelated guide: [File upload guide](https://docs.stripe.com/file-upload)\n\n## [File Links](https://docs.stripe.com/api/file_links)\n\nTo share the contents of a `File` object with non-Stripe users, you can create a `FileLink`. `FileLink`s contain a URL that you can use to retrieve the contents of the file without authentication.\n\n## [Mandates](https://docs.stripe.com/api/mandates)\n\nA Mandate is a record of the permission that your customer gives you to debit their payment method.\n\n## [Setup Attempts](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_attempts)\n\nA SetupAttempt describes one attempted confirmation of a SetupIntent, whether that confirmation is successful or unsuccessful. You can use SetupAttempts to inspect details of a specific attempt at setting up a payment method using a SetupIntent.\n\n## [Confirmation Token](https://docs.stripe.com/api/confirmation_tokens)\n\nConfirmationTokens help transport client side data collected by Stripe JS over to your server for confirming a PaymentIntent or SetupIntent. If the confirmation is successful, values present on the ConfirmationToken are written onto the Intent.\n\nTo learn more about how to use ConfirmationToken, visit the related guides:\n\n*   [Finalize payments on the server](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/finalize-payments-on-the-server)\n*   [Build two-step confirmation](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/build-a-two-step-confirmation).\n\n## [Tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens)\n\nTokenization is the process Stripe uses to collect sensitive card or bank account details, or personally identifiable information (PII), directly from your customers in a secure manner. A token representing this information is returned to your server to use. Use our [recommended payments integrations](https://docs.stripe.com/payments) to perform this process on the client-side. This guarantees that no sensitive card data touches your server, and allows your integration to operate in a PCI-compliant way.\n\nIf you can’t use client-side tokenization, you can also create tokens using the API with either your publishable or secret API key. If your integration uses this method, you’re responsible for any PCI compliance that it might require, and you must keep your secret API key safe. Unlike with client-side tokenization, your customer’s information isn’t sent directly to Stripe, so we can’t determine how it’s handled or stored.\n\nYou can’t store or use tokens more than once. To store card or bank account information for later use, create [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api#customers) objects or [External accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/api#external_accounts). [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar), our integrated solution for automatic fraud protection, performs best with integrations that use client-side tokenization.\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_account)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_bank_account)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_card)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_cvc_update)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_person)[POST/v1/tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/create_pii)[GET/v1/tokens/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens/retrieve)\n\n## [Cash Balance](https://docs.stripe.com/api/cash_balance)\n\nA customer’s `Cash balance` represents real funds. Customers can add funds to their cash balance by sending a bank transfer. These funds can be used for payment and can eventually be paid out to your bank account.\n\n## [Customer Portal Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customer_portal/sessions)\n\nThe Billing customer portal is a Stripe-hosted UI for subscription and billing management.\n\nA portal configuration describes the functionality and features that you want to provide to your customers through the portal.\n\nA portal session describes the instantiation of the customer portal for a particular customer. By visiting the session’s URL, the customer can manage their subscriptions and billing details. For security reasons, sessions are short-lived and will expire if the customer does not visit the URL. Create sessions on-demand when customers intend to manage their subscriptions and billing details.\n\nRelated guide: [Customer management](https://docs.stripe.com/customer-management)\n\n## [Invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices)\n\nInvoices are statements of amounts owed by a customer, and are either generated one-off, or generated periodically from a subscription.\n\nThey contain [invoice items](#invoiceitems), and proration adjustments that may be caused by subscription upgrades/downgrades (if necessary).\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed through automatic charges, Stripe automatically finalizes your invoice and attempts payment. Note that finalizing the invoice, [when automatic](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/automatic-advancement-collection), does not happen immediately as the invoice is created. Stripe waits until one hour after the last webhook was successfully sent (or the last webhook timed out after failing). If you (and the platforms you may have connected to) have no webhooks configured, Stripe waits one hour after creation to finalize the invoice.\n\nIf your invoice is configured to be billed by sending an email, then based on your [email settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/billing/automatic), Stripe will email the invoice to your customer and await payment. These emails can contain a link to a hosted page to pay the invoice.\n\nStripe applies any customer credit on the account before determining the amount due for the invoice (i.e., the amount that will be actually charged). If the amount due for the invoice is less than Stripe’s [minimum allowed charge per currency](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts), the invoice is automatically marked paid, and we add the amount due to the customer’s credit balance which is applied to the next invoice.\n\nMore details on the customer’s credit balance are [here](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/customer/balance).\n\nRelated guide: [Send invoices to customers](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/invoices/sending)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create)[POST/v1/invoices/create\\_preview](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/create_preview)[POST/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/lines/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_line)[GET/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/retrieve)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming)[GET/v1/invoices/:id/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices/upcoming/lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/upcoming_invoice_lines)[GET/v1/invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/list)[DELETE/v1/invoices/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/delete)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/add\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/add_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/remove\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/remove_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/update\\_lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/update_lines)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/finalize](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/finalize)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/mark\\_uncollectible](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/mark_uncollectible)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/pay](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/pay)[GET/v1/invoices/search](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/search)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/send](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/send)[POST/v1/invoices/:id/void](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/void)\n\n## [Meter Events](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event)\n\nA billing meter event represents a customer’s usage of a product. Meter events are used to bill a customer based on their usage. Meter events are associated with billing meters, which define the shape of the event’s payload and how those events are aggregated for billing.\n\n## [Meter Event Adjustment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_adjustment)\n\nA billing meter event adjustment is a resource that allows you to cancel a meter event. For example, you might create a billing meter event adjustment to cancel a meter event that was created in error or attached to the wrong customer.\n\n## [Meter Event Summary](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event_summary)\n\nA billing meter event summary represents an aggregated view of a customer’s billing meter events within a specified timeframe. It indicates how much usage was accrued by a customer for that period.\n\n## [Plans](https://docs.stripe.com/api/plans)\n\nYou can now model subscriptions more flexibly using the [Prices API](#prices). It replaces the Plans API and is backwards compatible to simplify your migration.\n\nPlans define the base price, currency, and billing cycle for recurring purchases of products. [Products](#products) help you track inventory or provisioning, and plans help you track pricing. Different physical goods or levels of service should be represented by products, and pricing options should be represented by plans. This approach lets you change prices without having to change your provisioning scheme.\n\nFor example, you might have a single “gold” product that has plans for $10/month, $100/year, €9/month, and €90/year.\n\nRelated guides: [Set up a subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/set-up-subscription) and more about [products and prices](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/overview).\n\n## [Tax IDs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_create)[POST/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/create)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_retrieve)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/retrieve)[GET/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_list)[GET/v1/tax\\_ids](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/list)[DELETE/v1/customers/:id/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/customer_delete)[DELETE/v1/tax\\_ids/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax_ids/delete)\n\n## [Account Links](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_links)\n\nAccount Links are the means by which a Connect platform grants a connected account permission to access Stripe-hosted applications, such as Connect Onboarding.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect Onboarding](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom/hosted-onboarding)\n\n## [Account Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_sessions)\n\nAn AccountSession allows a Connect platform to grant access to a connected account in Connect embedded components.\n\nWe recommend that you create an AccountSession each time you need to display an embedded component to your user. Do not save AccountSessions to your database as they expire relatively quickly, and cannot be used more than once.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect embedded components](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-connect-embedded-components)\n\n## [Application Fees](https://docs.stripe.com/api/application_fees)\n\nWhen you collect a transaction fee on top of a charge made for your user (using [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)), an `Application Fee` object is created in your account. You can list, retrieve, and refund application fees.\n\nRelated guide: [Collecting application fees](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges#collect-fees)\n\n## [Country Specs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/country_specs)\n\nStripe needs to collect certain pieces of information about each account created. These requirements can differ depending on the account’s country. The Country Specs API makes these rules available to your integration.\n\nYou can also view the information from this API call as [an online guide](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information).\n\n## [Person](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/create)[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/update)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/retrieve)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/list)[DELETE/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/delete)\n\n## [Transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/transfers)\n\nA `Transfer` object is created when you move funds between Stripe accounts as part of Connect.\n\nBefore April 6, 2017, transfers also represented movement of funds from a Stripe account to a card or bank account. This behavior has since been split out into a [Payout](#payout_object) object, with corresponding payout endpoints. For more information, read about the [transfer/payout split](https://docs.stripe.com/transfer-payout-split).\n\nRelated guide: [Creating separate charges and transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n\n## [Secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/secret_management)\n\nSecret Store is an API that allows Stripe Apps developers to securely persist secrets for use by UI Extensions and app backends.\n\nThe primary resource in Secret Store is a `secret`. Other apps can’t view secrets created by an app. Additionally, secrets are scoped to provide further permission control.\n\nAll Dashboard users and the app backend share `account` scoped secrets. Use the `account` scope for secrets that don’t change per-user, like a third-party API key.\n\nA `user` scoped secret is accessible by the app backend and one specific Dashboard user. Use the `user` scope for per-user secrets like per-user OAuth tokens, where different users might have different permissions.\n\nRelated guide: [Store data between page reloads](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/store-auth-data-custom-objects)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[GET/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/list)[POST/v1/apps/secrets/delete](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/delete)[GET/v1/apps/secrets/find](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/find)[POST/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/set)\n\n## [Reviews](https://docs.stripe.com/api/radar/reviews)\n\nReviews can be used to supplement automated fraud detection with human expertise.\n\nLearn more about [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar) and reviewing payments [here](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/reviews).\n\n## [Authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/update)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/list)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/approve](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/approve)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/decline](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/decline)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_create)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/capture](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_capture)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/expire](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_expire)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/finalize\\_amount](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_finalize_amount)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/increment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_increment)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/fraud\\_challenges/respond](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/respond_to_fraud_challenges)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/reverse](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_reverse)\n\n## [Cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/create)[POST/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/update)[GET/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/list)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/deliver](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_deliver)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/fail](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_fail)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/return](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_return)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/ship](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_ship)\n\n## [Physical Bundles](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/physical_bundles)\n\nA Physical Bundle represents the bundle of physical items -

  "markdown": "# Save bank details during an iDEAL payment\n\n## Learn how to save your customer's IBAN bank details from an iDEAL payment.\n\n#### Caution\n\niDEAL is a popular [single use](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#usage) payment method in the Netherlands where customers are required to [authenticate](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#customer-actions) their payment. [Customers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers \"Customers\") pay with iDEAL by redirecting to a webview, authorizing the payment, then returning to your app where you get [immediate notification](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods#payment-notification) on whether the payment succeeded or failed.\n\nYou can also use iDEAL to save your customer’s [IBAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Bank_Account_Number) bank details into a [SEPA Direct Debit](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/sepa-debit) [PaymentMethod](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods \"PaymentMethods\"). You can then use the SEPA Direct Debit PaymentMethod to [accept payments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/sepa-debit/accept-a-payment) or [set up a subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/sepa-debit). This reduces friction for your customer as they don’t have to enter their IBAN again. You also receive their verified name and validated IBAN.\n\n#### Caution\n\nAccepting iDEAL payments consists of creating a [PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object) object to track a payment, collecting payment method details and mandate acknowledgement, and submitting the payment to Stripe for processing. Stripe uses the PaymentIntent to track and handle all the states of the payment until the payment completes. Use the ID of the SEPA Direct Debit [PaymentMethod](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods \"PaymentMethods\") collected from your initial iDEAL PaymentIntent to create future payments.\n\n[](#web-set-up-stripe)\n\nFirst, you need a Stripe account. [Register now](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register).\n\nUse our official libraries for access to the Stripe API from your application:\n\n`# Available as a gem sudo gem install stripe`\n\n`# If you use bundler, you can add this line to your Gemfile gem 'stripe'`\n\n[](#create-customer)\n\nCreate a [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers \"Customers\") when they create an account with your business and associate it with your internal representation of their account. This enables you to retrieve and use their saved payment method details later.\n\n`curl -X POST https://api.stripe.com/v1/customers \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\"`\n\n[](#web-create-payment-intent)\n\nCreate a `PaymentIntent` on your server and specify the `amount` to collect, the `eur` currency, the customer ID, and `off_session` as an argument for [setup future usage](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-setup_future_usage). There is no minimum charge amount and iDEAL doesn’t support other currencies. If you have an existing [Payment Intents API](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents) integration, add `ideal` to the list of [payment method types](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-payment_method_types).\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/payment_intents \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d amount=1099 \\  -d currency=eur \\  -d \"payment_method_types[]\"=ideal \\  -d customer={{CUSTOMER_ID}} \\   -d setup_future_usage=off_session`\n\n### Retrieve the client secret![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe PaymentIntent includes a [client secret](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-client_secret \"PaymentIntent client secret\") that the client side uses to securely complete the payment process. You can use different approaches to pass the client secret to the client side.\n\nRetrieve the client secret from an endpoint on your server, using the browser’s `fetch` function. This approach is best if your client side is a single-page application, particularly one built with a modern frontend framework like React. Create the server endpoint that serves the client secret:\n\n`get '/secret' do   intent = # ... Create or retrieve the PaymentIntent   {client_secret: intent.client_secret}.to_json end`\n\nAnd then fetch the client secret with JavaScript on the client side:\n\n`(async () => {   const response = await fetch('/secret');   const {client_secret: clientSecret} = await response.json();   // Render the form using the clientSecret })();`\n\n[](#web-collect-payment-method-details)\n\nCollect payment information on the client with [Stripe Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/elements). Elements is a set of prebuilt UI components for collecting payment details. A Stripe Element contains an iframe that securely sends the payment information to Stripe over an HTTPS connection.\n\nThe checkout page address must also start with https:// rather than http:// for your integration to work. You can test your integration without using HTTPS. [Enable it](https://docs.stripe.com/security/guide#tls) when you’re ready to accept live payments.\n\n### Set up Stripe Elements![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nStripe Elements is automatically available as a feature of Stripe.js. Include the Stripe.js script on your payment page by adding it to the `head` of your HTML file. Always load Stripe.js directly from js.stripe.com to remain PCI compliant. Do not include the script in a bundle or host a copy of it yourself.\n\nCreate an instance of Elements with the following JavaScript on your checkout page:\n\n`const stripe = Stripe(`\n\n`'pk_test_TYooMQauvdEDq54NiTphI7jx'`\n\n`); const elements = stripe.elements();`\n\n### Add and configure an `idealBank` Element![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nElements needs a place to live in your payment form. Create empty DOM nodes (containers) with unique IDs in your payment form and then pass those IDs to Elements.\n\n​​To process SEPA Direct Debit payments, you must collect a mandate agreement from your customer. Display the following standard authorization text for your customer to implicitly sign the mandate.\n\nReplace _Rocket Rides_ with your company name.\n\nAuthorization text template\n\nBy providing your payment information and confirming this payment, you authorise (A)\n\nRocket Rides\n\nReplace this with your company name\n\nand Stripe, our payment service provider, to send instructions to your bank to debit your account and (B) your bank to debit your account in accordance with those instructions. As part of your rights, you are entitled to a refund from your bank under the terms and conditions of your agreement with your bank. A refund must be claimed within 8 weeks starting from the date on which your account was debited. Your rights are explained in a statement that you can obtain from your bank. You agree to receive notifications for future debits up to 2 days before they occur.\n\n​​Setting up a payment method or confirming a PaymentIntent creates the accepted mandate. As the customer has implicitly signed the mandate, you must communicate these terms in your form or through email.\n\n`<form id=\"payment-form\">   <div class=\"form-row\">     <label for=\"accountholder-name\">       Name     </label>     <input id=\"accountholder-name\"  name=\"accountholder-name\">   </div>    <div class=\"form-row\">     <label for=\"accountholder-email\">       Email     </label>     <input id=\"accountholder-email\"  name=\"accountholder-email\">   </div>    <div class=\"form-row\">     <!--       Using a label with a for attribute that matches the ID of the       Element container enables the Element to automatically gain focus       when the customer clicks on the label.     -->     <label for=\"ideal-bank-element\">       iDEAL Bank     </label>     <div id=\"ideal-bank-element\">       <!-- A Stripe Element will be inserted here. -->     </div>   </div>    <button id=\"submit-button\" data-secret=\"{CLIENT_SECRET}\">Submit</button>    <!-- Display mandate acceptance text. -->   <div id=\"mandate-acceptance\">     By providing your payment information and confirming this payment, you     authorise (A) Rocket Rides and Stripe, our payment service provider, to     send instructions to your bank to debit your account and (B) your bank to     debit your account in accordance with those instructions. As part of your     rights, you are entitled to a refund from your bank under the terms and     conditions of your agreement with your bank. A refund must be claimed     within 8 weeks starting from the date on which your account was debited.     Your rights are explained in a statement that you can obtain from your     bank. You agree to receive notifications for future debits up to 2 days     before they occur.   </div>   <!-- Used to display form errors. -->   <div id=\"error-message\" role=\"alert\"></div> </form>`\n\nWhen the form above has loaded, [create an instance](https://docs.stripe.com/js/elements_object/create_element?type=idealBank) of an `idealBank` Element and mount it to the Element container created above:\n\n``const options = {   // Custom styling can be passed to options when creating an Element   style: {     base: {       padding: '10px 12px',       color: '#32325d',       fontSize: '16px',       '::placeholder': {         color: '#aab7c4'       },     },   }, };  // Create an instance of the idealBank Element const idealBank = elements.create('idealBank', options);  // Add an instance of the idealBank Element into // the `ideal-bank-element` <div> idealBank.mount('#ideal-bank-element');``\n\nElements are completely customizable. You can [style Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/js/elements_object/create_element?type=idealBank#elements_create-options) to match the look and feel of your site, providing seamless checkout for your customers. It’s also possible to style various input states, for example when the Element has focus.\n\n[](#web-submit-payment)\n\nRather than sending the entire PaymentIntent object to the client, use its [client secret](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-client_secret) from [step 3](#web-create-payment-intent). This is different from your API keys that authenticate Stripe API requests.\n\nThe client secret should still be handled carefully because it can complete the charge. Do not log it, embed it in URLs, or expose it to anyone but the customer.\n\nUse [stripe.confirmIdealPayment](https://docs.stripe.com/js/payment_intents/confirm_ideal_payment) to handle the redirect away from your page and to complete the payment. Add a [return\\_url](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create#create_payment_intent-return_url) to this function to indicate where Stripe should redirect the user after they complete the payment on their bank’s website or mobile application.\n\nInclude your customer’s name and email address in `payment_method[billing_details]`. They will be used when generating the SEPA Direct Debit PaymentMethod.\n\n#### Caution\n\nIn order to pass the `setup_future_usage` parameter as shown below, you must modify the API version you passed when creating your instance of Elements. Review the instructions for [setting up Stripe Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/ideal/save-during-payment#set-up-stripe-elements) from above if you are unable to pass `setup_future_usage` at this step.\n\n`const form = document.getElementById('payment-form'); const accountholderName = document.getElementById('accountholder-name');  form.addEventListener('submit', (event) => {   event.preventDefault();    // Redirects away from the client   const {error} = await stripe.confirmIdealPayment(     '{{PAYMENT_INTENT_CLIENT_SECRET}}',     {       payment_method: {         ideal: idealBank,         billing_details: {           name: accountholderName.value,         },       },       return_url: 'https://example.com/checkout/complete',     }   ); });`\n\nWhen your customer submits a payment, Stripe redirects them to the `return_url` and includes the following URL query parameters. The return page can use them to get the status of the PaymentIntent so it can display the payment status to the customer.\n\nWhen you specify the `return_url`, you can also append your own query parameters for use on the return page.\n\n| Parameter | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `payment_intent` | The unique identifier for the `PaymentIntent`. |\n| `payment_intent_client_secret` | The [client secret](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object#payment_intent_object-client_secret) of the `PaymentIntent` object. |\n\nWhen the customer is redirected back to your site, you can use the `payment_intent_client_secret` to query for the PaymentIntent and display the transaction status to your customer.\n\n[](#web-charge-sepa-pm)\n\nWhen you need to charge your customer again, create a new PaymentIntent. Find the ID of the SEPA Direct Debit payment method by [retrieving](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/retrieve) the previous PaymentIntent and [expanding](https://docs.stripe.com/api/expanding_objects) the `latest_charge` field where you will find the `generated_sepa_debit` ID inside of `payment_method_details`.\n\n`curl -G https://api.stripe.com/v1/payment_intents/{{PAYMENT_INTENT_ID}} \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d \"expand[]\"=latest_charge`\n\nThe SEPA Direct Debit payment method ID is the `generated_sepa_debit` ID under [payment\\_method\\_details](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/object#charge_object-payment_method_details-ideal) in the response.\n\n`{   \"latest_charge\": {     \"payment_method_details\": {       \"ideal\": {         \"bank\": \"ing\",         \"bic\": \"INGBNL2A\",         \"iban_last4\": \"****\",         \"generated_sepa_debit\": \"pm_1GrddXGf98efjktuBIi3ag7aJQ\",         \"verified_name\": \"JENNY ROSEN\"       },       \"type\": \"ideal\"     },   },   \"payment_method_options\": {     \"ideal\": {}`\n\nCreate a PaymentIntent with the SEPA Direct Debit and Customer IDs.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/payment_intents \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d \"payment_method_types[]\"=sepa_debit \\  -d amount=1099 \\  -d currency=eur \\  -d customer=  {{CUSTOMER_ID}}   \\  -d payment_method={{SEPA_DEBIT_PAYMENT_METHOD_ID}} \\   -d confirm=true`\n\n[](#test-your-integration)\n\nUsing your [test API keys](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#test-live-modes), select any bank from the list. After confirming the PaymentIntent, you’re redirected to a test page with options to authorize or fail the payment.\n\n*   Click **Authorize test payment** to test the case when the payment is successful. The PaymentIntent transitions from `requires_action` to `succeeded`.\n*   Click **Fail test payment** to test the case when the customer fails to authenticate. The PaymentIntent transitions from `requires_action` to `requires_payment_method`.\n\n### Test your SEPA Direct Debit integration ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nSet `payment_method.billing_details.email` to one of the following values to test the PaymentIntent status transitions. You can include your own custom text at the beginning of the email address followed by an underscore. For example, `test_1_generatedSepaDebitIntentsFail@example.com` results in a SEPA Direct Debit PaymentMethod that always fails when used with a PaymentIntent.\n\n| Email Address | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `generatedSepaDebitIntentsSucceed@example.com` | The PaymentIntent status transitions from `processing` to `succeeded`. |\n| `generatedSepaDebitIntentsSucceedDelayed@example.com` | The PaymentIntent status transitions from `processing` to `succeeded` after three minutes. |\n| `generatedSepaDebitIntentsFail@example.com` | The PaymentIntent status transitions from `processing` to `requires_payment_method`. |\n| `generatedSepaDebitIntentsFailDelayed@example.com` | The PaymentIntent status transitions from `processing` to `requires_payment_method` after three minutes. |\n| `generatedSepaDebitIntentsSucceedDisputed@example.com` | The PaymentIntent status transitions from `processing` to `succeeded`, but a dispute is created immediately. |\n\n## See also![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n*   [Accept a SEPA Direct Debit payment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/sepa-debit/accept-a-payment)\n*   [Set up a subscription with SEPA Direct Debit in the EU](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/sepa-debit)",

We recommend using [Connect Onboarding for Standard accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/standard-accounts) instead.\n\nStarting in June 2021, Platforms using OAuth with `read_write` scope won’t be able to connect to Standard accounts that are controlled by another platform.\n\n[Extensions](https://docs.stripe.com/building-extensions) will not experience any changes to how OAuth behaves. Learn more about [OAuth changes for platform-controlled Standard accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/oauth-changes-for-standard-platforms).\n\n## The OAuth connection flow ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nA user connects to your platform using the following OAuth connection flow:\n\n1.  From a page on your site, the user clicks a [link](#integrating-oauth) that redirects them to Stripe, passing along your platform’s `client_id`.\n2.  On Stripe’s website, the user provides the necessary information for [connecting](#connect-users) to your platform.\n3.  The user is [redirected](#redirected) to your site, along with an authorization code.\n4.  Your site then makes a request to Stripe’s [OAuth token endpoint](#token-request) to complete the connection and fetch the user’s account ID.\n\n#### Note\n\nAs a platform, remember that data you create for an account (for example, charges, customers, [invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices \"invoices\"), and so on) will be visible on their Stripe account. It also means that if they connect other platforms, those platforms can access this data too.\n\n[\n\n## Create the OAuth link![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n\n\n](#integrating-oauth)\n\nTo start your integration, go to your [platform settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/applications/settings) and:\n\n*   Enable onboarding accounts with OAuth in the OAuth settings.\n*   Copy your `client_id`, a unique identifier for your platform that is generated by Stripe.\n*   Set your `redirect_uri`, the URL which your user will be redirected to after connecting their account. You must specify all redirect URLs in your platform settings. If you do not include the `redirect_uri` parameter in your request, Stripe defaults to using the first address you have configured in your platform settings.\n\nStripe also provides a development `client_id` to help with [testing](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/testing#using-oauth).\n\nWith these two pieces of information in hand, you’re ready to create the OAuth link. We recommend showing a **Connect with Stripe** button that sends users to the `authorize_url` endpoint:\n\nThe Stripe endpoint should receive at least these three parameters:\n\n*   `response_type`, with a value of **code**\n*   Your `client_id`\n*   `scope`, with a value of **read\\_write**\n\nThe `scope` parameter dictates what your platform can do on behalf of the connected account, with **read\\_only** being the default.\n\nTo prevent CSRF attacks, add the `state` parameter, passing along a unique token as the value. We’ll include the `state` you gave us when we redirect the user back to your site.

Unless you change the default network, you must inform your customers that whenever they use a dual-network debit card, their payments might be processed through the debit network, regardless of the logo that appears when they enter their payment information.\n\nWe recommend you notify your customers based on the type of payment transaction:\n\n*   For single payment transactions, display a notification to the customer before the completion of the checkout process.\n*   For new recurring payment transactions, display a notification to the customer at the time of setup.\n*   For existing recurring payment transactions, notify your customers in advance of future transactions.\n\nYou must notify your customers about how network routing functions, and how payments processing works. You can use the suggested notification message below:\n\n#### Note\n\nNotwithstanding the payment brand logo displayed when you enter your payment information, whenever you use a dual-network debit card displaying eftpos and another payment brand, your payment (including any future recurring debit payments authorized by you) might be processed through either network. See the \\[Terms and Conditions\\] or \\[FAQs\\] for more information.\n\nWe recommend that you provide further information in your Terms and Conditions or FAQs on how network routing functions and how payments processing works. For guidelines on best practices, see the Australian Payments Network [MCR Online Notification Guidelines](https://www.auspaynet.com.au/resources/cards-and-devices).\n\n## Understand which network processes payments ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nStripe dynamically routes between the international scheme (Visa or Mastercard) and eftpos, depending on the type of payment, technical availability and authorization rate considerations:\n\n*   If a payment requires [placing a hold on the card](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/place-a-hold-on-a-payment-method) (in other words, if there’s a delay between authorization and capture), or if it requires [3D Secure](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/3d-secure), Stripe always routes to the international scheme.\n*   For other types of payments, Stripe generally defaults to the eftpos network.\n\nIf you require that eftpos is never the default network for any payments, please contact [support](https://support.stripe.com/contact).\n\nTo identify which network a payment was processed on, inspect the [network](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/object#charge_object-payment_method_details-card-network) field on the [Charge](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/object) object associated with a successful [Payment Intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object):\n\n`{   \"id\": \"ch_1Ff52K2eZvKYlo2CWe10i0s7\",   \"object\": \"charge\",   ...   \"payment_method_details\": {     \"card\": {       \"brand\": \"visa\",       ...       \"network\": \"eftpos_au\"     },     \"type\": \"card\"   } }`\n\n## See also![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n*   [Migrating from Charges API to the Payment Intents API](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents/migration)\n*   [Available eftpos test cards](https://docs.stripe.com/testing#cards)",

  "markdown": "# Identifying potential fraud | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Learn about the most common fraud indicators.\n\nBecause Stripe users are responsible for fulfilling orders for customers and possess the most information about their customer at the time of purchase, they’re best equipped to determine whether or not a payment is potentially fraudulent. There are external indicators that indicate a payment might be fraud, such as [Early Fraud Warnings](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/how-disputes-work#early-fraud-warnings), but fraud activity also has many implicit indicators that by themselves don’t unambiguously signal fraud. However, the existence of several of these indicators at the same time can more clearly suggest a payment is fraudulent.\n\nWith [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar \"Radar\") for Fraud Teams, card payments that have an elevated risk of fraud are automatically placed into [review](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/reviews). However, you might want to create additional rules based on the following factors to place additional payments into review—or block them completely. Although our recommendations can help prevent disputes and fraud, they can’t eliminate them completely. We want our users to be as informed as possible, both so that they can accept or refund any payments they believe are fraudulent and so they’re equipped to accept the [financial responsibility](https://stripe.com/terms#chargebacks) of any suspicious payments that enter their Stripe account.\n\n## Common types of fraud indicators![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThere are many types of fraud indicators, some of which are easy to identify such as false numbers or email addresses, other types may be more intuitive and nuanced, such as a conversation with a customer that seems off. Having an understanding of the various ways fraudsters use false information to make fraudulent transactions will better help you to protect against them. Some of the most common types of fraud indicators are:\n\n*   Use of likely false information (for example, fake phone numbers and email addresses like **asdkf12495@freemail.example.com**).\n*   Inconsistencies in customer details across multiple purchases (for example, using the same e-mail address but a different name for another payment).\n*   Communication that doesn’t sounds quite right. Fraudsters often use a canned response that is sent to multiple sellers using common phrases. If any communication appears scripted, use a search engine (putting the short phrase in quotes) to see if it’s been used elsewhere (for example, [this particular phrase](https://www.google.com/search?sourceid=gmail&rls=gm&q=%22%20I%20%20would%20like%20to%20proceed%20with%20the%20payment.%20I%27m%20buying%20it%20for%20someone%20special%20as%20a%20gift.%20%22&gws_rd=ssl) has been used many times).\n*   Unusually large orders (for example, multiples of the same item, only your most expensive merchandise, expensive items or total order amount that seems inconsistent with normal customer behavior).\n*   Many payments (including those that have been declined) made with:\n    *   The same card but different shipping addresses.\n    *   Many cards that use the same shipping address.\n    *   The same card from the same IP address.\n    *   The same customer name/email address.\n    *   If each failed attempt is associated with a different credit card, any successful payment carries a much greater risk for fraud.\n    *   Similar or the same card numbers, especially over a short duration and for smaller amount. This is especially true for crowdfunding/fundraising sites.\n*   Any requests to:\n    *   Split a large order into multiple payments across different cards that don’t share the same verified billing address information.\n    *   Process a payment manually, either through the Dashboard or your store. Fraudsters may make this request in order to have the charge run with your local IP address instead of their own.\n    *   Charge a card more than the required amount (known as an “overcharge”) and pay out a third-party (for example, driver, shipper or freight company) using a different payment method (for example, cash, money order).\n    *   Charge a card and then provide a refund outside the card network (for example, check, wire transfer).\n\nDeclined payments can provide valuable information and should also be regularly reviewed.\n\n## Shipping physical goods![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nFraudsters can take advantage of various shipping methods to steal physical goods. When shipping products be sure to:\n\n*   Check whether the shipping and billing addresses match. Although a difference in address by itself doesn’t indicate fraud (for example, the customer might have purchased a gift), it indicates that the charge should be looked at more carefully. If the addresses do match and the customer is using a credit card from the US, Canada, or UK, check to see if the postal code and street address verifications passed.\n*   Watch for customers who ask to change the shipping address after the order is placed. Fraudsters may use a legitimate address to obtain a successful charge but later ask that products be shipped elsewhere.\n*   Evaluate rush orders or requests for overnight delivery (which would allow fraudsters to take advantage of timing).\n*   Review the credit card’s country of origin (the country in which it was issued) in a charge’s payment detail in the Stripe Dashboard. The billing address provided should match this country. Where the shipping country that doesn’t match the card’s origin or is a country typically not shipped to, it’s important to take extra steps to verify the legitimacy of the charge.\n*   Ensure that shipping methods are appropriate, especially for overnight shipping at a high cost. People using stolen credit cards don’t usually worry about how expensive the shipping is and want goods right away, before the card number is reported as stolen or compromised. Never agree to use a customer’s “preferred shipper” or agree to pay a third party shipping company on your customer’s behalf; these are usually a second front for fraud.\n*   Consider instituting a 24-48 hour shipping delay for high-value orders or shipments to non-verified addresses or first-time customers.\n*   If you have a verified billing postal code, make sure the shipping label generated by your shipper displays this postal code after you enter the address. Some fraudsters provide a valid billing postal code, but the rest of the address (street, city, and state) is fraudulent, and automated systems such as USPS self-service often autocorrect the postal code you enter—effectively changing it from the verified billing postal code to the fraudster’s.\n*   Use of international cards or orders with international shipping addresses.\n*   Be aware of high-risk shipping destinations.\n*   Take extra care when shipping to a [freight forwarder](http://www.forwarders.com/home/directories.html).\n\nIf you’d like to familiarize yourself with the postal code prefixes in the US by region, use this [reference map](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/ZIP_Code_zones.svg/1024px-ZIP_Code_zones.svg.png).\n\nGenerally, Stripe can’t see the shipping address customers provide and shipping information isn’t necessary to successfully accept a payment. However, you can improve Stripe’s fraud detection by sending the shipping address when [creating a payment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create).\n\n## Digital goods or services![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n[Customers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers \"Customers\") that misuse digital goods or services are more likely to be using stolen credit cards. It is very important to collect and verify as many card details as possible, including CVC, street address, and postal code. Consider rejecting charges that fail the CVC and postal code checks. As a general rule when selling digital goods or services, be sure to:\n\n*   Be aware of customers sending spam using a product for messaging or making many purchases in a short period of time for downloadable content or “in-game” items.\n*   Watch for multiple accounts using similar email addresses or the same credit card. You can include this in your review queue through a [review rule](https://dashboard.stripe.com/fraud/rules).\n*   Watch for multiple charges to the same email address in rapid succession. You can include this in your review queue through a [review rule](https://dashboard.stripe.com/fraud/rules).\n*   Watch for unexpected or significant changes in account activity. If the purchase frequency or dollar amount of payments for an account increases significantly, it may be an indication of fraudulent activity.\n*   View evidence about the payments, including IP address, email logs, usage logs (that is, did they log in and actually use the service?), and so on. Pass this information to us, so that you can view it as you review a charge.\n\n## Donations or crowdfunding![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nMake sure the donation makes sense for your campaign. If you’re running a small, personal campaign and you receive a very large donation from an unknown individual, scrutinize it carefully. Consider refunding if you can’t verify the individual making the donation.\n\nIf you receive a large donation and the donor reaches out to you to say they made a mistake and only meant to donate part of the amount, be cautious. Fraudsters sometimes make a large donation (such as 1,000 USD) and later tell you they only meant to donate a smaller amount (like 100 USD) and ask you to refund the rest. This is done to test a stolen card’s credit limit. If this scenario appears, it may be prudent to refund the entire donation.\n\nMonitor your declined payments. Many of them that used different cards in rapid succession indicate a fraudster is testing stolen card numbers. If it does look like someone is testing cards on your website, consider adding a delay or implementing a [CAPTCHA](http://captcha.net/) during checkout to slow them down. This usually encourages a card tester to move on.\n\n## Mark a payment as fraudulent![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYou can mark a payment as fraudulent using either the Stripe API or the Dashboard. For instructions, see the [Feedback on risk evaluations](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/risk-evaluation#feedback-on-risk-evaluations) section in the Risk evaluation guide.\n\n## See also![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n*   [Common types of fraud](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/prevention/fraud-types)\n*   [Verification checks](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/prevention/verification)\n*   [Best practices for preventing fraud](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/prevention/best-practices)",

Join [Stripe Insiders](https://insiders.stripe.dev/c/sandboxes/6), our new early access program, to register your interest in joining the Sandboxes private beta.\n\nA sandbox is an isolated environment that replaces test mode. You can use your sandbox to test all available Stripe functionality in your business account, and experiment with new features without affecting your live integration. When testing in a sandbox, the payments you create aren’t processed by card networks or payment providers, and funds aren’t moved.\n\n## Key features![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nSandboxes provide the following key features:\n\n*   **Simulate Stripe events to test without real money movement**: Use your sandbox to test payments functionality without real money movement. Create payments in your business account to accumulate a fake balance or use test helpers to simulate external events.\n    \n*   **Scale isolated sandboxes for teams**: Your team can work in separate sandboxes to make sure that data and actions are completely isolated from other sandboxes. Changes made in one sandbox don’t interfere with changes in another. Your business account can have up to six sandboxes at a time.\n    \n*   **Test in the Dashboard or the CLI**: Access your sandbox from the Dashboard or the [Stripe CLI](https://docs.stripe.com/cli-preview-plugin). Test Stripe functionality directly in the Dashboard or use familiar CLI commands and fixtures.\n    \n\n## Test mode data![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYour test mode data is still available in your Legacy Test mode sandbox. We recommend using sandboxes that contain more features rather than using Legacy Test mode. The following features are only available in sandboxes:\n\n*   Create and delete a sandbox.\n*   Assign access to select users. All users who have access to your live business account have access to the Legacy Test mode sandbox.\n*   Verify that settings changes don’t affect your live business. Changing some settings in Legacy Test mode might affect settings for your live business.\n\n## Manage sandboxes through the Dashboard![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nClick **Sandboxes** for an overview of your sandboxes.

All other currencies fall under alternative currencies.\n*   The primary currency for Stripe accounts in Hong Kong is HKD. All other currencies fall under alternative currencies.\n\n## Alternative currency payouts![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nAt Stripe, a domestic payout is when you pay out to a bank account that’s domiciled in the same country as your Stripe account. You can make domestic payouts using the primary currency for a Stripe account or with an alternative currency. For example, when you pay out in EUR from an account based in France to a France-domiciled bank account, it’s a domestic payout in the primary currency. However, if you make a payout in any other currency to a France-domiciled bank account, it’s a domestic payout but in an alternative currency.\n\nYou can also pay out to certain non-domestic bank accounts in the account’s local currency, subject to applicable fees. For example, when you pay out in USD from a France-based account to a US-domiciled bank account, the non-domestic payout is subject to the fees listed below.\n\nWith alternative currency payouts, it’s easier to hold funds in up to 18 supported currencies needed to pay suppliers, process refunds, and so on, without having to re-convert funds or use third-party sites.\n\nAlternative currency payouts are available in select currencies for businesses in Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia, and Europe, including the United Kingdom.\n\nIf your business is based in a country that’s not currently eligible for alternative currency payouts, [we’d love to hear from you](https://support.stripe.com/) as we work to expand.\n\n## Setting up your bank account for alternative currency payouts![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nTo enable alternative currency payouts, you must configure the currencies and bank accounts in your [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/payouts).\n\nFirst, in your Payout Settings, you need to select the settlement currency you want to receive funds in using the **Manage currencies** button to start accumulating a balance in that currency.\n\nA settlement currency is the currency your bank account uses, and you must select a settlement currency before adding a bank account in that currency. After you add a bank account in that currency, you can receive the accrued balance.\n\nIf you select a settlement currency but don’t add a bank account for that currency, funds still accrue and remain in the account balance in the alternative currency until you add a supported bank account. Additionally, removing a bank account from your Dashboard doesn’t disable the settlement currency, so you can still accrue a balance in that currency. You need to disable a currency to stop accruing a balance in that currency.\n\n### Presentment currency payouts![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nWhen the presentment currency differs from any of your enabled settlement currencies, the currencies accepted by any of your bank accounts or debit cards, we automatically convert the payment to your default settlement currency before transferring the funds. View [Currency conversions](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies/conversions) for details.\n\n### Connected Accounts![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYou can enable your connected accounts to pay out in alternative currencies using the toggle under “Alternative currency payouts” in your [Connect payout settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect/payouts).\n\n## Payout fees & minimum payout amount for alternative currency payouts ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nStripe bills alternative currency payout fees asynchronously in the currency matching the payout.

  "markdown": "# Invoices API updates | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Stripe has recently improved the clarity and expressiveness of the statuses that an invoice can have.\n\nIn previous versions of the Stripe API, [Invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices \"invoices\") didn’t have statuses. Instead, there was a series of booleans, like `closed`, `paid`, and `forgiven`.\n\nWe’ve introduced statuses on invoices to better correlate Stripe invoices with finance workflows. Now, all [Invoice objects](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/object) have a `status` property. The `status` field can have the values `draft`, `open`, `paid`, `void`, and `uncollectible`.\n\n*   The `draft` status indicates that an invoice is mutable.\n*   The `open` status indicates that the invoice has been finalized, is no longer mutable, and is ready for payment.\n*   The `paid` status indicates that the invoice has been paid in full.\n*   The `void` status indicates that the invoice is no longer valid.\n*   The `uncollectible` status indicates that the invoice is very unlikely to be paid, and could be considered a bad debt.\n\nFor more details on these statuses, and the transitions between them, see the [invoicing](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/overview) guide.\n\n## Sample invoice timelines![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThis section presents sample timelines for both [one-off](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/dashboard#create-invoice) and [subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/invoices/subscription) invoices, showing the statuses that both types of invoices can proceed through.\n\n### One-off invoice example![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nHere is an example timeline that a one-off invoice could go through. This sequence of events presents no changes from the pre-existing invoicing timeline, except that Stripe now exposes a `status` field to more clearly represent an invoice’s status.\n\n*   **Nov 16**: Through the API, you might create an invoice that represents shipping 12 widgets to a customer. Stripe sends an `invoice.created` [webhook](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks \"webhook\"), notifying you of the recently-created invoice. Looking at the API, you see that the invoice has `status='draft'`.\n*   **Nov 26**: After reviewing the invoice, an accountant finalizes the invoice using the Stripe Dashboard. While the invoice is being finalized, its status is updated to `status='open'` and the `finalized_at` field is set. Stripe sends an `invoice.finalized` webhook, notifying you that the invoice was finalized.\n*   **Nov 26**: Seconds later, Stripe emails the invoice, and begins retries. To help your CRM system keep track of when invoices are sent, Stripe sends an `invoice.sent` webhook each time it’s sent.\n*   **Dec 01**: Your customer clicks the link in the email and pays the invoice using a Hosted Invoice Payment page. Unfortunately, they pay with an expired credit card. Their payment fails, and Stripe sends the `invoice.payment_failed` webhook notifying you of this failure.\n*   **Dec 03**: With an updated credit card, the customer tries again. This time, the payment succeeds! Stripe sends the `invoice.paid` webhook notifying you of this success, saves the card, and sets the invoice to `status='paid'`. If configured, Stripe also immediately emails your customer a receipt showing that the invoice was paid.\n\n### Subscription invoice example![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nHere is an example timeline for an invoice generated by a [subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/creating \"subscriptions\").\n\n*   **Nov 13**: Through the dashboard, you create a recurring subscription for a customer, configured for [charging automatically](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/automatic-charging). The subscription has a 20 day trial, so the first invoice will be in 20 days (Dec 03). Stripe sends a `customer.subscription.created` webhook.\n\n*   **Nov 30**: Three days before the trial ends, Stripe [sends](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/trials) a `customer.subscription.trial_will_end` webhook. Three days before charging the credit card would be a good time to send a trial reminder email.\n\n*   **Dec 03**: At the end of the trial, a `status='draft'` invoice is created. Stripe sends an `invoice.created` webhook, notifying you of the recently-created invoice.\n*   **Dec 03**: [Approximately one hour](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/webhooks) later, the invoice is [automatically finalized](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/overview). This entails updating the `status` as `'open'`, setting `finalized_at`, and sending an `invoice.finalized` webhook.\n*   **Dec 03**: Soon after, Stripe attempts to charge the customer’s card on file. The customer’s payment succeeds. Stripe sends the `invoice.paid` webhook to notify you of this success, and sets the invoice to `status='paid'`.\n\n## New API methods![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nStripe has released a [suite of new APIs](https://docs.stripe.com/api#invoices) for managing the status of an invoice. The new options, detailed in the [upgrade checklist](#upgrade-checklist) below, are:\n\n*   **Send an invoice**: Stripe automatically sends and re-sends invoices through email. This endpoint, available in the Stripe API, allows you to send the invoice to your customer whenever you want.\n*   **Finalize an invoice**: In the example above, the accountant finalized the invoice using the Stripe Dashboard. This functionality is also available in the Stripe API.\n*   **Void an invoice**: Once an invoice has been finalized, it can’t be deleted. _Voiding_ is used to indicate that the invoice was issued in error. You could consider voiding an invoice with an error in your company’s name, and then creating an entirely new invoice to replace it.\n*   **Delete a draft invoice**: This action is applicable only to draft invoices. Deleted invoices aren’t visible through your Dashboard or the API. They cannot be un-deleted.\n*   **Mark an invoice uncollectible**: Your accounting department might want to maintain a register of “doubtful debts” - that is, a list of invoices that are deemed to be uncollectible. You can use this API to tag applicable invoices.\n\n## Upgrade checklist ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nThe following sections list functional changes in the `Invoice` object, and in invoice-related webhooks.\n\n### `Invoice` object![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nStripe has added several fields to the `Invoice` object to help users better understand its status and behavior.\n\n#### `finalized_at`\n\nThe new `finalized_at` field indicates the time at which the invoice was finalized. This is available for requests made on all API versions.\n\n#### `status`\n\nThe new `status` field is available for requests made on all API versions. This replaces many booleans on the invoice, such as:\n\n*   For requests made with the 2018-11-08 version and later, the `paid=true` boolean is removed. Check for the equivalent `status='paid'` instead.\n*   For requests made with the 2018-11-08 version and later, the `forgiven=true` boolean is removed. Check for the equivalent `status='uncollectible'` instead.\n\n#### `auto_advance`\n\nThe new `auto_advance` field indicates whether automatic collection is active. For the `'draft'` and `'open'` statuses, the `auto_advance` field can be updated. Otherwise, `auto_advance` will always be `false`.\n\nWhen `auto_advance=false`, Stripe will _not_:\n\n*   Automatically issue draft invoices\n*   Automatically send the first (or reminder) emails for `collection_method='send_invoice'` invoices\n*   Automatically attempt the first (or retry) payments for `collection_method='charge_automatically'` invoices\n\nEven with `auto_advance=false`, Stripe automatically reconciles inbound credit transfers. If a transfer references an invoice, the credit transfer is reconciled to that invoice. If an invoice isn’t provided, Stripe searches for unpaid invoices and tries to pay them.\n\nFor invoices with the statuses `'uncollectible'`, `'void'`, and `'paid'`, the `auto_advance` field is always `false`.\n\nOn versions prior to 2018-11-08, the `closed` field is still present, and equal to the inverse of `auto_advance`. For example, `auto_advance=true` is equivalent to `closed=false` (and vice versa). Invoices created using prior API versions will continue to default to `closed=false`.\n\n### Webhooks![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nWith this update, we’ve introduced three new webhooks:\n\n*   `invoice.finalized`: Sent when an invoice is finalized.\n*   `invoice.voided`: Sent when an invoice is voided.\n*   `invoice.marked_uncollectible`: Sent when an invoice is marked uncollectible.\n\nThe existing `invoice.created` webhook is sent upon creating an invoice. If your webhook handler needs to differentiate between one-off invoices and invoices generated by a subscription, check for the existence of the `invoice.subscription` property in the webhook body.\n\nThese pre-existing webhooks are unchanged:\n\n*   `invoice.sent`: Sent when an invoice is emailed to a user, either automatically, through the [API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/send), or in the Dashboard.\n*   `invoice.deleted`: Sent when a `draft` invoice is deleted, either through the [API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/delete) or in the Dashboard.\n*   `invoice.paid` or `invoice.payment_failed`: Sent when an attempt to pay an invoice succeeds or fails.",

  "markdown": "# Link in the Payment Element\n\n## Link in the Payment Element lets your customers check out faster.\n\nLet your customer check out faster by using [Link](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link/what-is-link) in the [Payment Element](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-element). You can autofill information for any logged-in customer already using Link, regardless of whether they initially saved their information in Link with another business. The default Payment Element integration includes a Link prompt in the card form. To manage Link in the Payment Element, go to your [payment method settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods).\n\n![Authenticate or enroll with Link directly in the Payment Element during checkout](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/link-in-pe.2efb5138a4708b781b8a913ebddd9aba.png)\n\nCollect a customer email address for Link authentication or enrollment\n\n## Integration options ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nThere are two ways you can integrate Link with the Payment Element. Of these, Stripe recommends passing a customer email address to the Payment Element if available. Remember to consider how your checkout flow works when deciding between these options:\n\n| Integration option | Checkout flow | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| [Pass a customer email address](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link/add-link-elements-integration?link-integration-type=before-payment) to the Payment Element Recommended | *   Your customer enters their email address before landing on the checkout page (in a previous account creation step, for example).<br>*   You prefer to use your own email input field. | Programmatically pass a customer email address to the Payment Element. In this scenario, a customer authenticates to Link directly in the payment form instead of a separate UI component. |\n| [Collect a customer email address](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link/add-link-elements-integration?link-integration-type=collect-email) in the Payment Element | Your customers enter their email and authenticate or enroll with Link directly in the Payment Element during checkout. | If a customer hasn’t enrolled with Link and they choose a supported payment method in the Payment Element, they’re prompted to save their details using Link. For those who have already enrolled, Link automatically populates their payment information. |\n\n## The defaultValues parameter ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nIf you’re planning on passing customer email addresses to the Payment Element, use the [defaultValues](https://docs.stripe.com/js/elements_object/create_payment_element#payment_element_create-options-defaultValues) object to specify a customer’s [billingDetails](https://docs.stripe.com/js/elements_object/create_payment_element#payment_element_create-options-defaultValues-billingDetails). Prefilling as much information as possible streamlines the checkout process:\n\n`// Pass in defaultValues to prefill consumer information const paymentElement = elements.create('payment', {   defaultValues: {     billingDetails: {       name: 'John Doe',       email: 'john.doe@example.com',       address: {         city: 'New York',         country: 'US',         line1: '123 Main St',         postal_code: '10001',         state: 'NY'       }     }, }});`\n\n## Automatically prefill Link for your customers ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nSave your customers from re-entering details to sign up for or log into Link when they’ve already provided them elsewhere on your checkout page. Link includes a prefill tool that detects customer information such as email or phone number in your checkout, then automatically populates corresponding Link fields. This convenience encourages your customers to use Link, which has been shown to increase the likelihood that a customer successfully completes checkout. Prefilled values are never stored unless the customer completes a Link sign-up.\n\nWhen a customer enters information such as their email, phone number, or name on the same checkout page as the Element where Link is enabled, Link’s prefill tool can:\n\n*   Populate the Link sign-up form with the customer email/phone/name. The customer must proceed with Link sign-up to create an account.\n*   Populate the Link login with the customer’s email when they already have a Link account, so they can just enter the one time password.\n\n### Enable the prefill tool![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nThe Link prefill tool requires no changes to your existing integration. The prefill tool is on by default when you enable Link. You can disable the prefill tool in the [Link settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/link#features) on your Dashboard at any time.\n\n#### How it works![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nWhen a customer loads a page containing the Element with Link enabled and the `defaultValue` parameter hasn’t already provided Stripe customer data, our system analyzes the surrounding checkout page to locate input fields containing details that match Link sign-up or login fields. Link only looks for information applicable to creating or reusing a Link account.\n\nIf Stripe detects such data fields, we use the values to prefill the Link login with email, or prefill sign-up fields with customer information required to create a Link account. We don’t store the prefilled values on the browser using cookies or local storage or any other service. We only hold the values temporarily in local memory for use in the context of the session.\n\nFor current Link users, we use the prefilled information to trigger a login to Link, and don’t store any information from the page.\n\nCustomers who haven’t previously created a Link account can choose whether to use the prefilled information to sign up for Link. We only store the prefilled information if the customer takes action and provides consent to create a Link account.",

With usage information and the pricing model set up by the [metered billing](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/metered-billing) plan, Stripe helps you send accurate invoices to your customers.\n\nThe default calculation for usage is to add up all the `quantity` values of the usage records within a billing period. You can change this default behavior with the billing plan’s `aggregate_usage` [parameter](https://docs.stripe.com/api/plans/create#create_plan-aggregate_usage). When there is more than one usage record with the same timestamp, Stripe adds the `quantity` values together. In most cases, this is the desired resolution, however, you can change this behavior with the `action` parameter.\n\nThe default pricing model for metered billing is [per-unit pricing](https://docs.stripe.com/api/plans/object#plan_object-billing_scheme). For finer granularity, you can configure metered billing to have a [tiered pricing](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/tiers) model.\n\n### Parameters\n\n*   The usage quantity for the specified timestamp.\n    \n*   Valid values are `increment` (default) or `set`. When using `increment` the specified `quantity` will be added to the usage at the specified timestamp. The `set` action will overwrite the usage quantity at that timestamp.

Default is `\"now\"` if a value is not provided.\n    \n\n### Returns\n\nReturns the usage record object.\n\nPOST /v1/subscription\\_items/:id/usage\\_records\n\n```\ncurl https://api.stripe.com/v1/subscription_items/si_IutmSSymhsWA5i/usage_records \\  -u \"sk_test_4eC39Hq...arjtT1zdp7dcsk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc:\" \\  -d quantity=100 \\  -d timestamp=1571252444\n```\n\n```\n{  \"id\": \"mbur_1IJ3zE2eZvKYlo2CsJAtf1Jl\",  \"object\": \"usage_record\",  \"livemode\": false,  \"quantity\": 100,  \"subscription_item\": \"si_IutmSSymhsWA5i\",  \"timestamp\": 1571252444}\n```\n\n## [List all subscription item period summaries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/usage_records/subscription_item_summary_list)\n\nFor the specified subscription item, returns a list of summary objects. Each object in the list provides usage information that’s been summarized from multiple usage records and over a subscription billing period (e.g., 15 usage records in the month of September).\n\nThe list is sorted in reverse-chronological order (newest first). The first list item represents the most current usage period that hasn’t ended yet. Since new usage records can still be added, the returned summary information for the subscription item’s ID should be seen as unstable until the subscription billing period ends.\n\n### Parameters\n\nNo parameters.\n\n### More parameters\n\n### Returns\n\nA dictionary with a `data` property that contains an array of up to `limit` summaries, starting after summary `starting_after`. Each entry in the array is a separate summary object. If no more summaries are available, the resulting array is empty.\n\nGET /v1/subscription\\_items/:id/usage\\_record\\_summaries\n\n```\ncurl -G https://api.stripe.com/v1/subscription_items/si_E9xjsAhGRXCCWe/usage_record_summaries \\  -u \"sk_test_4eC39Hq...arjtT1zdp7dcsk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc:\" \\  -d limit=3\n```\n\n```\n{  \"object\": \"list\",  \"url\": \"/v1/subscription_items/si_E9xjsAhGRXCCWe/usage_record_summaries\",  \"has_more\": false,  \"data\": [    {      \"object\": \"list\",      \"url\": \"/v1/subscription_items/si_E9xjsAhGRXCCWe/usage_record_summaries\",      \"has_more\": false,      \"data\": [        {          \"id\": \"sis_1Bnyrd2eZvKYlo2CuVcUbXln\",          \"object\": \"usage_record_summary\",          \"invoice\": \"in_1Bnyrd2eZvKYlo2CSV57GLV8\",          \"livemode\": false,          \"period\": {            \"end\": 0,            \"start\": null          },          \"subscription_item\": \"si_18UXa82eZvKYlo2CbYoIEZVv\",          \"total_usage\": 1        }      ]    }    {...}    {...}  ],}\n```\n\n## [Account Links](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_links)\n\nAccount Links are the means by which a Connect platform grants a connected account permission to access Stripe-hosted applications, such as Connect Onboarding.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect Onboarding](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/custom/hosted-onboarding)\n\n## [Account Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/account_sessions)\n\nAn AccountSession allows a Connect platform to grant access to a connected account in Connect embedded components.\n\nWe recommend that you create an AccountSession each time you need to display an embedded component to your user. Do not save AccountSessions to your database as they expire relatively quickly, and cannot be used more than once.\n\nRelated guide: [Connect embedded components](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/get-started-connect-embedded-components)\n\n## [Application Fees](https://docs.stripe.com/api/application_fees)\n\nWhen you collect a transaction fee on top of a charge made for your user (using [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect)), an `Application Fee` object is created in your account. You can list, retrieve, and refund application fees.\n\nRelated guide: [Collecting application fees](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges#collect-fees)\n\n## [Country Specs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/country_specs)\n\nStripe needs to collect certain pieces of information about each account created. These requirements can differ depending on the account’s country. The Country Specs API makes these rules available to your integration.\n\nYou can also view the information from this API call as [an online guide](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information).\n\n## [Person](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/create)[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/update)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/retrieve)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/list)[DELETE/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/delete)\n\n## [Transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/transfers)\n\nA `Transfer` object is created when you move funds between Stripe accounts as part of Connect.\n\nBefore April 6, 2017, transfers also represented movement of funds from a Stripe account to a card or bank account. This behavior has since been split out into a [Payout](#payout_object) object, with corresponding payout endpoints. For more information, read about the [transfer/payout split](https://docs.stripe.com/transfer-payout-split).\n\nRelated guide: [Creating separate charges and transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n\n## [Secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/secret_management)\n\nSecret Store is an API that allows Stripe Apps developers to securely persist secrets for use by UI Extensions and app backends.\n\nThe primary resource in Secret Store is a `secret`. Other apps can’t view secrets created by an app. Additionally, secrets are scoped to provide further permission control.\n\nAll Dashboard users and the app backend share `account` scoped secrets. Use the `account` scope for secrets that don’t change per-user, like a third-party API key.\n\nA `user` scoped secret is accessible by the app backend and one specific Dashboard user. Use the `user` scope for per-user secrets like per-user OAuth tokens, where different users might have different permissions.\n\nRelated guide: [Store data between page reloads](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/store-auth-data-custom-objects)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[GET/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/list)[POST/v1/apps/secrets/delete](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/delete)[GET/v1/apps/secrets/find](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/find)[POST/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/set)\n\n## [Reviews](https://docs.stripe.com/api/radar/reviews)\n\nReviews can be used to supplement automated fraud detection with human expertise.\n\nLearn more about [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar) and reviewing payments [here](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/reviews).\n\n## [Authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/update)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/list)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/approve](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/approve)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/decline](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/decline)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_create)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/capture](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_capture)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/expire](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_expire)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/finalize\\_amount](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_finalize_amount)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/increment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_increment)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/fraud\\_challenges/respond](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/respond_to_fraud_challenges)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/reverse](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_reverse)\n\n## [Cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/create)[POST/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/update)[GET/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/list)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/deliver](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_deliver)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/fail](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_fail)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/return](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_return)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/ship](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_ship)\n\n## [Physical Bundles](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/physical_bundles)\n\nA Physical Bundle represents the bundle of physical items - card stock, carrier letter, and envelope - that is shipped to a cardholder when you create a physical card.\n\n## [Reader](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/terminal/readers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/create)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/update)[GET/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/retrieve)[GET/v1/terminal/readers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/list)[DELETE/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/delete)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/cancel\\_action](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/cancel_action)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/collect\\_inputs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/collect_inputs)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/confirm\\_payment\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/confirm_payment_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/collect\\_payment\\_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/collect_payment_method)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/process\\_payment\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/process_payment_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/process\\_setup\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/process_setup_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/refund\\_payment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/refund_payment)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/set\\_reader\\_display](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/set_reader_display)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/terminal/readers/:id/present\\_payment\\_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/present_payment_method)\n\n## [Terminal Hardware Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_products)Preview feature\n\nA TerminalHardwareProduct is a category of hardware devices that are generally similar, but may have variations depending on the country it’s shipped to.\n\nTerminalHardwareSKUs represent variations within the same Product (for example, a country specific device). For example, WisePOS E is a TerminalHardwareProduct and a WisePOS E - US and WisePOS E - UK are TerminalHardwareSKUs.\n\n## [Terminal Hardware SKU](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_skus)Preview feature\n\nA TerminalHardwareSKU represents a SKU for Terminal hardware. A SKU is a representation of a product available for purchase, containing information such as the name, price, and images.\n\n## [Transaction Entries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/transaction_entries)\n\nTransactionEntries represent individual units of money movements within a single [Transaction](#transactions).\n\n## [Scheduled Queries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/sigma/scheduled_queries)\n\nIf you have [scheduled a Sigma query](https://docs.stripe.com/sigma/scheduled-queries), you’ll receive a `sigma.scheduled_query_run.created` webhook each time the query runs. The webhook contains a `ScheduledQueryRun` object, which you can use to retrieve the query results.\n\n## [Report Types](https://docs.stripe.com/api/reporting/report_type)\n\nThe Report Type resource corresponds to a particular type of report, such as the “Activity summary” or “Itemized payouts” reports. These objects are identified by an ID belonging to a set of enumerated values. See [API Access to Reports documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/reporting/statements/api) for those Report Type IDs, along with required and optional parameters.\n\nNote that certain report types can only be run based on your live-mode data (not test-mode data), and will error when queried without a [live-mode API key](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#test-live-modes).\n\n## [Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/financial_connections/sessions)\n\nA Financial Connections Session is the secure way to programmatically launch the client-side Stripe.js modal that lets your users link their accounts.\n\n## [Verification Report](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_reports)\n\nA VerificationReport is the result of an attempt to collect and verify data from a user. The collection of verification checks performed is determined from the `type` and `options` parameters used. You can find the result of each verification check performed in the appropriate sub-resource: `document`, `id_number`, `selfie`.\n\nEach VerificationReport contains a copy of any data collected by the user as well as reference IDs which can be used to access collected images through the [FileUpload](https://docs.stripe.com/api/files) API. To configure and create VerificationReports, use the [VerificationSession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_sessions) API.\n\nRelated guide: [Accessing verification results](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verification-sessions#results).\n\n## [Crypto Onramp Quotes](https://docs.stripe.com/api/crypto/onramp_quotes)\n\nCrypto Onramp Quotes are estimated quotes for onramp conversions into all the different cryptocurrencies on different networks. The Quotes API allows you to display quotes in your product UI before directing the user to the onramp widget.\n\nRelated guide: [Quotes API](https://docs.stripe.com/crypto/quotes-api)\n\n## [Climate Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/climate/product)\n\nA Climate product represents a type of carbon removal unit available for reservation. You can retrieve it to see the current price and availability.\n\n## [Forwarding Request](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/request)\n\nInstructs Stripe to make a request on your behalf using the destination URL. The destination URL is activated by Stripe at the time of onboarding. Stripe verifies requests with your credentials provided during onboarding, and injects card details from the payment\\_method into the request.\n\nStripe redacts all sensitive fields and headers, including authentication credentials and card numbers, before storing the request and response data in the forwarding Request object, which are subject to a 30-day retention period.\n\nYou can provide a Stripe idempotency key to make sure that requests with the same key result in only one outbound request. The Stripe idempotency key provided should be unique and different from any idempotency keys provided on the underlying third-party request.\n\nForwarding Requests are synchronous requests that return a response or time out according to Stripe’s limits.\n\nRelated guide: [Forward card details to third-party API endpoints](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/forwarding).\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/create)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/retrieve)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/list)",

This is purely visual. It defaults to `false`.\n\n`<TextArea label=\"Favorite word\" defaultValue=\"Stripe Apps lets you embed custom…\" invalid />`\n\n## Resizeable![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nBy default, `TextArea` is vertically resizable. Users who need more space typically prefer this. If you need to prevent the element from resizing, set `resizeable` to `false`.\n\n`<TextArea label=\"Resizable bio\" defaultValue=\"Stripe Apps lets you embed custom…\" /> <TextArea   label=\"Unresizable bio\"   resizeable={false}   defaultValue=\"Stripe Apps lets you embed custom…\" />`\n\n## Size![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nChanging the `size` allows you to choose variants with slightly more or slightly less room than the default. In general you don’t want to mix and match different sizes within the same form. The default is `medium`.\n\n`<TextArea   label=\"Description (large)\"   size=\"large\"   defaultValue=\"Stripe Apps lets you embed custom…\" /> <TextArea   label=\"Description (medium, default)\"   size=\"medium\"   defaultValue=\"Stripe Apps lets you embed custom…\" /> <TextArea   label=\"Description (small)\"   size=\"small\"   defaultValue=\"Stripe Apps lets you embed custom…\" />`\n\n## Disable and read only![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYou can mark a field as `disabled`, which prevents any interaction and changes the styling. Disabled means that no data from that form element is submitted when the form is submitted.\n\nYou can also make a field as `readOnly`. Read-only means any data from within the element is submitted, but the user can’t change it.\n\n`<TextArea label=\"Disabled\" defaultValue=\"Stripe Apps lets you embed custom…\" disabled /> <TextArea label=\"Readonly\" defaultValue=\"Stripe Apps lets you embed custom…\" readOnly />`\n\n## Rows![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nA `TextArea` uses rows to control its height rather than using a traditional height in pixels, just like a regular `<TextArea />`. This allows the element to size itself based on multiples of the font size, rather than a raw pixel value. It prevents text from being partially obscured by default.\n\nThe vertical height of your `TextArea` component also changes depending on what size value you set, because that changes the line height of the text inside the input.\n\n`<TextArea label=\"Description (3 rows, default)\" defaultValue=\"Stripe Apps lets you embed custom…\" /> <TextArea label=\"Description (6 rows)\" rows={6} defaultValue=\"Stripe Apps lets you embed custom…\" />`\n\n## State management![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nUse the `TextArea` component as an [uncontrolled input](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/how-ui-extensions-work#use-uncontrolled-components-for-interactions):\n\n`<TextArea   onChange={(e) => {     console.log(e);   }}   label=\"About your business\"   placeholder=\"Our business is…\" />`\n\n## Width![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nSet the width of a `TexaArea` component using [the available values](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/style#sizing) with the `css` prop:\n\n`<TextArea   label=\"App feedback\"   defaultValue=\"Stripe Apps lets you embed custom…\"   css={{width: 'fill'}} />`",

  "markdown": "# Company types | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Form a C Corporation or an LLC using Stripe Atlas.\n\nStripe Atlas supports two options for forming a US company in Delaware: C Corporations and Limited Liability Companies (LLC).\n\nWith Stripe Atlas, you can only form a standalone LLC. You can’t form an LLC as a subsidiary. If you choose to form an LLC, you establish a new company that’s owned by one individual or a group. The following list contains some of the characteristics of an LLC:\n\n*   **Capital**: LLCs are common for self-funded or small businesses with no plans to raise outside capital.\n*   **Tax treatment**: Profits and losses of an LLC flow through to its members, and the LLC has no entity-level tax. If you have more than one member or if you have a non-US member for your LLC, however, tax filings can become complex.\n\n#### Note\n\nFor information about LLCs as an alternative to C Corporations, take a look at our Stripe Atlas guide on [picking an entity](https://stripe.com/atlas/guides/llc-vs-c-corp).\n\n## When to form your company ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nIf you plan to form your company near the end of the calendar year, it can make sense to wait until the start of the new year to form your company because of the tax implications. C Corporations active in Delaware any time before December 31 owe at least the minimum Delaware franchise tax for that year. LLCs active before December 31 owe the full annual LLC tax for that year.\n\nNeither the franchise tax nor the LLC tax is prorated. Your company might also owe US federal corporate income tax for the outgoing year. It might also owe taxes to a US state other than Delaware, depending on where the LLC operates.",

Use Tooltips to provide additional contextual information about a particular element or subject. You can use tooltips as either **descriptions** or **labels**.\n\nAvoid putting any interactive content such as links within a Tooltip, because keyboard users won’t be able to access it.\n\n### Tooltip props![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n| Property | Type |\n| --- | --- |\n| `children` | Required<br><br>`React.ReactNode`<br><br>The contents of the component. |\n| `trigger` | Required<br><br>`React.RefObject<HTMLElement> \\| React.ReactElement`<br><br>The target element that should be used as the Tooltip trigger. |\n| `delay` | Optional<br><br>`number \\| undefined`<br><br>How much time in milliseconds to wait before showing the Tooltip on hover. |\n| `placement` | Optional<br><br>`(\"bottom\" \\| \"bottom left\" \\| \"bottom right\" \\| \"bottom start\" \\| \"bottom end\" \\| \"top\" \\| \"top left\" \\| \"top right\" \\| \"top start\" \\| \"top end\" \\| \"left\" \\| \"left top\" \\| \"left bottom\" \\| \"start\" \\| \"start top\" \\| \"start bottom\" \\| \"right\" \\| \"right top\" \\| \"right bottom\" \\| \"end\" \\| \"end top\" \\| \"end bottom\") \\| undefined`<br><br>How the Tooltip should be placed relative to the trigger element. |\n| `type` | Optional<br><br>`(\"label\" \\| \"description\") \\| undefined`<br><br>The style variant of the Tooltip. |\n\n## Placement![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nYou can place tooltips in one of four primary directions and further align them along a secondary axis, resulting in a total of 12 possible placement options relative to the `trigger`. The placement automatically adjusts as necessary to ensure the Tooltip remains visible within the viewport.\n\n`<Tooltip placement=\"top left\" trigger={<Button onPress={undefined}><Icon name=\"info\" /></Button>}>   \"top left\" </Tooltip> <Tooltip placement=\"top\" trigger={<Button onPress={undefined}><Icon name=\"info\" /></Button>}>   \"top\" </Tooltip> <Tooltip placement=\"top right\" trigger={<Button onPress={undefined}><Icon name=\"info\" /></Button>}>   \"top right\" </Tooltip> <Tooltip placement=\"right top\" trigger={<Button onPress={undefined}><Icon name=\"info\" /></Button>}>   \"right top\" </Tooltip> <Tooltip placement=\"right\" trigger={<Button onPress={undefined}><Icon name=\"info\" /></Button>}>   \"right\" </Tooltip> <Tooltip placement=\"right bottom\" trigger={<Button onPress={undefined}><Icon name=\"info\" /></Button>}>   \"right bottom\" </Tooltip> <Tooltip placement=\"bottom right\" trigger={<Button onPress={undefined}><Icon name=\"info\" /></Button>}>   \"bottom right\" </Tooltip> <Tooltip placement=\"bottom\" trigger={<Button onPress={undefined}><Icon name=\"info\" /></Button>}>   \"bottom\" </Tooltip> <Tooltip placement=\"bottom left\" trigger={<Button onPress={undefined}><Icon name=\"info\" /></Button>}>   \"bottom left\" </Tooltip> <Tooltip placement=\"left bottom\" trigger={<Button onPress={undefined}><Icon name=\"info\" /></Button>}>   \"left bottom\" </Tooltip> <Tooltip placement=\"left\" trigger={<Button onPress={undefined}><Icon name=\"info\" /></Button>}>   \"left\" </Tooltip> <Tooltip placement=\"left top\" trigger={<Button onPress={undefined}><Icon name=\"info\" /></Button>}>   \"left top\" </Tooltip>`\n\n## Delay![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nTooltips have a short delay for when they appear after hovering over their trigger element.

These DNS records are necessary to verify your domain ownership and reliable email delivery.\n\nThe procedure for adding DNS records to the DNS server for your domain depends on who provides your DNS service. Consult the documentation for your DNS service for specific instructions.\n\n### Instructions for popular providers\n\nIt can take up to 72 hours for DNS record changes to be confirmed. Stripe lets you know whether your domain has been verified.\n\n### Troubleshoot DNS issues ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nIf your domain hasn’t been verified after 72 hours, try the following:\n\n*   Correct any typos. You can check your domain records in the Dashboard’s [Customer emails](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/emails) settings by clicking **Verify domain** to filter issues.\n    \n*   Make sure you don’t have any records that share the same name as the provided CNAME records. CNAME records must be the [only record present](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2181#section-10.1) for a record name.\n    \n*   Make sure the added record names don’t include your domain twice. Some providers automatically append DNS record names with the domain name. For example, to create a record with the name **bounce.example.com**, enter only `bounce` in the **Name** field.\n    \n*   Check that the DNS records are published. You can verify this by using a [DNS lookup tool](https://dnschecker.org/all-dns-records-of-domain.php), which displays the published records for your domain.\n    \n\nIf you’ve tried all of our troubleshooting recommendations and are still having trouble verifying your domain, contact your DNS provider.\n\n### DNS records ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nEach category of record that needs to be configured has a purpose.\n\n| Record Category | Type | Purpose |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Stripe proof-of-ownership | TXT | Before you can send email from a domain, we must confirm ownership of the domain you plan to use. |\n| Mail From Domain | CNAME | This specifies the source of the message to the receiving email server and the [Sender Policy Framework (SPF)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7208) policy to allow sending. |\n| [DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM)](http://www.dkim.org/) | CNAME | These allow a mail server to verify that a third party didn’t modify a message in transit. |\n\n#### Caution\n\nAfter we verify the domain, don’t delete the provided DNS records from your domain. Stripe frequently checks these records. If a record becomes invalid or goes missing, we notify you. Also, make sure to correct DNS records within 48 hours. If you don’t, we send customer emails from _stripe.com_ until you resolve the problem.\n\n### Sender authentication (DMARC) ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nTo use a custom email domain, you need to set up a DMARC policy for your domain. [Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance (DMARC)](https://dmarc.org/) shields your domain from impersonation attacks, such as phishing. Notably, major email providers like Google and Yahoo now necessitate DMARC for those sending bulk emails.\n\nYou publish DMARC policy as a DNS TXT record. The record’s name is always `_dmarc`, and the value comprises tag-value pairs that symbolize your policy. Additionally, you can learn about all the [supported tags and their uses](https://dmarc.org/overview/), but let’s cover some of the most significant tags:\n\n| Tag | Description | Sample value |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| v required | The protocol version. This must always be DMARC1. | v=DMARC1 |\n| p required | The policy for domain. The possible values are: none, quarantine, reject. | p=none |\n| rua optional | Address(es) to receive aggregate reports | rua=mailto:report@example.com |\n\nIf you’re new to DMARC, we suggest beginning with a `p=none` policy for initial monitoring, then switch to either `quarantine` or `reject` in due course. After you’ve settled on the appropriate policy, you must incorporate the following DNS record into your domain:\n\n| Type | Name | Value |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| TXT | `_dmarc` | Your DMARC policy. For example: `v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:report@example.com` |\n\n#### Caution\n\nWe don’t currently support strict SPF alignment. Make sure your DMARC policy doesn’t have `aspf=s`.\n\nIf you’re already using this domain to send email, use caution when adding DMARC to make sure that it doesn’t interfere with your existing configuration. Consult an email or IT professional before adding or modifying this record.\n\n[\n\n## Set your sending domain![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\n\n\n](#setting_sending_domain)\n\nIf Stripe has verified your domain, you’ll see a **Verified** badge under the **Verification** column in your [Customer email](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/emails) settings. Customer emails are now sent from your domain. You can send a test email by clicking the overflow menu ().\n\nWhenever a customer replies to your emails, their responses are sent to the support email address you specified in your [public business information](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/public).\n\n## Change email domains ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nWe must verify each domain that you want to set as your sending domain. To switch to a new domain, return to [Add your domain](#setup). You can always switch back to sending your customer emails using `stripe.com`.\n\nWhen you’re no longer using a domain to send customer emails, you can remove it from your [Customer email](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/emails) settings. In the **Your custom email domains** section, click the overflow menu () next to the domain name and select **Remove domain**. After removing the domain from your Dashboard, remove the unused DNS records from your DNS service.\n\n### Instructions for popular providers",

  "markdown": "# Model usage-based pricing | Stripe DocumentationThe Stripe Docs logo\n\n## Learn about different pricing models for usage-based billing on Stripe.\n\n#### Note\n\nThere are various pricing models for usage-based billing: pay as you go, fixed fee and overage (recommended for most users), and credit burndowns.\n\n## Pay as you go![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nCommonly referred to as “in arrears billing”, the “pay as you go” model lets you track usage incurred over a determined period, then charge the customer at the end of the period. There are four different pricing strategies you can deploy:\n\n*   **Per unit**: Charge the same amount for every single unit.\n*   **Per package**: Charge for a package or bundle of units or usage. This is the model for the [fictional Alpaca AI company](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/usage-based/implementation-guide#what-you-will-build).\n*   **Tiered and volume based pricing**: The subscription item is billed at the tier corresponding to the amount of usage at the end of the period. Learn more about [volume-based pricing](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/pricing-models#volume-based-pricing).\n*   **Tiered and graduated pricing**: Similar to volume pricing, [graduated pricing](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/pricing-models#graduated-pricing) charges for the usage in each tier instead of applying a single price to all usage.\n\nThis model might not be ideal if your business involves customers with low-trust because customers might accumulate significant usage and then have their payment method fail at the end of the month.\n\n## Fixed fee and overage model![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nIn this model, you charge a flat fee per month for your service at the beginning of the period. This flat fee has some included usage entitlement, and any additional usage (overage) is charged at the end of the period.\n\nYou can model this with two prices within the same product. For example, Alpaca AI introduces a new advanced model called Llama AI. Priced at 200 USD per month, this model includes 100,000 tokens. Any usage beyond the included tokens is charged at an additional rate of 0.001 USD per token.\n\nTo create a product:\n\n1.  Navigate to the [Products tab](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/products).\n2.  Click **\\+ Add product**.\n3.  Enter the name of the product (in this case, Llama AI).\n\nNext, add a **recurring** flat fee price to the Llama AI product:\n\n1.  Select **Flat rate** pricing for the pricing model.\n2.  Set the amount to **200 USD**.\n\nNext, add a second **recurring** price to the product. The first tier is priced at 0 USD because the first 100,000 units are included in the flat rate.\n\n1.  Select **Usage-based, Per Tier and Graduated** for the pricing model\n    \n2.  Create two graduated pricing tiers:\n    \n    |     | First unit | Last unit | Per unit | Flat fee |\n    | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n    | For the first | 0   | 100,000 | 0.00 USD | 0.00 USD |\n    | For the next | 100,001 | ∞   | 0.001 USD | 0.00 USD |\n    \n3.  Create a new meter `llama_api_tokens` to record usage.\n    \n\nWhen you create subscriptions, specify both of the prices you created above.\n\n## Credit burndown model![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nIn this payment model, users pay an initial amount and gradually use up credits for their usage. Currently, Stripe doesn’t support this specific model, but we’re actively developing native support for it. [Click here](#) if you’re interested in gaining access to a future beta.\n\n[](#billing-thresholds)\n\nSet [billing thresholds](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/object#subscription_object-billing_thresholds) to issue an [invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices \"invoices\") and, optionally, to reset a subscription’s [billing cycle anchor](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/create#create_subscription-billing_thresholds-reset_billing_cycle_anchor) after a customer’s accrued usage in a subscription cycle reaches a specified monetary threshold. Consider using billing thresholds to add precautions to limit the amount owed or to limit the products consumed between invoices or charges.\n\n#### Add a monetary threshold to a subscription ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nIt’s common to set the value of a threshold as a multiple of the cost of one unit of the product being sold.\n\nSetting a lower amount threshold causes your customers to receive an invoice for every unit of usage, which might cause confusion.\n\nThe value is a positive integer in the [smallest currency unit](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#zero-decimal) (for example, 100 cents to charge 1 USD; or 100 to charge 100 JPY, a zero-decimal currency). Set the value to at least 50 currency units.\n\nYou can also set monetary thresholds in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/subscriptions) when you create or update a subscription.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/subscriptions/sub_49ty4767H20z6a \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d \"billing_thresholds[amount_gte]\"=10000 \\  -d \"billing_thresholds[reset_billing_cycle_anchor]\"=false`\n\n#### Add a usage threshold to a subscription item ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nSet usage thresholds to exceed one unit of usage to prevent frequent invoicing. Stripe doesn’t support setting usage thresholds in the Dashboard.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/subscription_items/si_CFhSgkWb0MyTWg \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d \"billing_thresholds[usage_gte]\"=2000`\n\n#### Thresholds and billing cycle anchor ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nBy default, the [billing cycle anchor](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/billing-cycle) of a subscription remains unchanged after a customer’s usage reaches a threshold. For example, if a threshold is reached in the middle of a month-long subscription, the subscription resets at the end of the month, similar to a subscription without thresholds.\n\nYou can change this behavior by configuring the subscription to reset the billing cycle anchor after it reaches a threshold. Stripe treats the reaching of a threshold as if the subscription had naturally arrived at its rollover point at the end of the month.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/subscriptions/sub_49ty4767H20z6a \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d \"billing_thresholds[reset_billing_cycle_anchor]\"=true`\n\n#### Thresholds and tiered pricing ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nStripe maintains tiers across threshold invoices. Tiers reset at the end of the billing period by default, or if you configure the subscription to reset the billing cycle anchor after it reaches a threshold, similar to a subscription without thresholds.\n\nFor example, let’s say you run an ad platform that has the following `graduated` tiering structure for ad impressions:\n\n| Tier | Amount (unit cost) |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1-10000 (up\\_to=10000) | 0.50 USD (`unit_amount=50`) |\n| 10000+ (`up_to=inf`) | 0.40 USD (`unit_amount=40`) |\n\nBecause Stripe bills usage retrospectively, you can set a threshold of 100 USD as a temporary measure for new customers. Under this scheme, your customer is billed every 200 impressions for the first 10,000 impressions (200 \\* 0.50 USD = 100 USD). When the customer exceeds 10,000 impressions, they’re billed every 250 impressions (250 \\* 0.40 USD = 100 USD). This continues until the end of the billing period, at which point all un-invoiced usage are invoiced, and the subscription and tiers reset.\n\nTo enable the resetting of tiers after reaching a threshold, you must configure the subscription to reset the billing cycle anchor after the usage reaches the thresholds that you set.\n\n##### Volume tiers ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\n[Volume tiers](#volume-based-pricing) define the pricing for all units of usage, as opposed to [graduated tiers](#graduated-pricing), which define pricing for a specific amount of usage. Some pricing models use volume tiers that decrease the unit cost at each successive tier. You can use these models to incentivize customers to use more of a product (for example, ad impressions, or GB of storage).\n\nWhen combined with thresholds, these pricing models can lead to invoices with line items for negative amounts under the following conditions:\n\n1.  A threshold invoice has already been issued.\n2.  Subsequent usage bills at a lower unit cost.\n\nFor example, consider the following tiered pricing structure:\n\n| Tier | Amount (unit cost) |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1-10000 (`up_to=10000`) | 0.50 USD (`unit_amount=50`) |\n| 10000+ (`up_to=inf`) | 0.40 USD (`unit_amount=40`) |\n\nIf a customer uses 10,000 units, the invoice total is 5,000 USD (10,000 \\* 0.50 USD = 5,000 USD). Any additional usage causes _all_ usage to bill at the lower unit cost of 0.40 USD. If the customer uses one more unit, the invoice total _drops_ to 4,000.40 USD (10,001 \\* 0.40 USD = 4,000.40 USD).\n\nWithout thresholds, Stripe would issue an invoice for 4,000.40 USD at the end of the billing period.\n\nHowever, to see how negative invoicing can occur, assume that we have a 5,000 USD monetary threshold in place. In this scenario, Stripe issues an invoice when the customer reaches 10,000 units of usage.\n\nIf the customer uses one more unit, the invoice total drops to 4,000.40 USD (10,001 \\* 0.40 USD = 4,000.40 USD). However, if the customer doesn’t consume more units, they’re _owed_ 999.60 USD (5,000 USD - 4,000.40 USD = 999.60 USD). At the end of the billing period, Stripe credits this amount to the customer’s balance, which we use to pay down future invoices.\n\nLet’s say the customer continues to accrue usage. The cost of this usage reaches 5,000 USD again when the customer uses 12,500 units (5,000 USD / 0.40 USD = 12,500). However, the previous payment of 5,000 USD covers all of this usage. As a result, we don’t issue an invoice.\n\nStripe won’t issue an invoice until either the total usage reaches 25,000 units (for a total cost of 10,000 USD), or the end of the billing period arrives—whichever occurs first. The tables below show the line items you see for the two invoices issued in the scenario where usage reaches 25,000 units.\n\nInvoice 1:\n\n| Line item | Quantity | Amount |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Usage (0.50 USD per unit) | 10,000 | 5,000 USD |\n| **Total** |     | **5,000 USD** |\n\nInvoice 2:\n\n| Line item | Quantity | Amount |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Usage (0.40 USD per unit) | 25,000 | 10,000 USD |\n| Amount previously billed (at 0.50 USD per unit) |     | \\-5,000 USD |\n| **Total** |     | **5,000 USD** |\n\n#### Limitations ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\n*   Thresholds don’t apply to [trial subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/trials).\n*   Monetary thresholds must be greater than the sum of any flat fees on metered subscription items.\n*   Billing thresholds aren’t evaluated during the 24 hours leading up to the end of a subscription. This helps limit confusion for a customer who receives multiple invoices on the same date.\n*   We only allow subscriptions a single monetary threshold.\n*   We only allow subscription items a single usage threshold.\n*   Due to the real-time nature of usage reporting, we might not issue invoices at the exact moment a specified threshold is reached. Invoiced amounts or usage might be slightly higher than the specified thresholds.\n*   The value used to determine whether a monetary threshold has been reached excludes taxes, but includes discounts.\n*   Per package per tiering pricing isn’t currently supported\n\n[](#trials)\n\nYou can use [trial periods](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/trials) for subscriptions with usage-based billing. During the trial period, any usage accrued doesn’t count toward the total charged to the customer at the end of the billing cycle. After the trial period ends, usage accrues and is billed at the end of the next billing cycle.\n\nLearn more about [trial periods and subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/trials).\n\n### Webhooks and trials![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg)\n\nMake sure that your integration properly monitors and handles web events related to changes in trial status.\n\nA few days before a trial ends and the subscription moves from `trialing` to `active`, you receive a `customer.subscription.trial_will_end` event. When you receive this event, make sure that you have a payment method on the customer’s account to proceed with billing them. Optionally, notify the customer in advance about the upcoming charge.\n\n| Status | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `trialing` | The subscription is currently in a trial period and it’s safe to provision your product for your customer. The subscription transitions automatically to `active` when the first payment is made. |\n| `active` | The subscription is in good standing and the most recent payment is successful. It’s safe to provision your product for your customer. |\n| `incomplete` | A successful payment needs to be made within 23 hours to activate the subscription. Or the payment [requires action](#requires-action), like customer authentication. Subscriptions can also be `incomplete` if there’s a pending payment and the PaymentIntent status would be `processing`. |\n| `incomplete_expired` | The initial payment on the subscription failed and no successful payment was made within 23 hours of creating the subscription. These subscriptions don’t bill customers. This status exists so you can track customers that failed to activate their subscriptions. |\n| `past_due` | Payment on the latest _finalized_ invoice either failed or wasn’t attempted. The subscription continues to create invoices. Your [subscription settings](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/overview#settings) determine the subscription’s next state. If the invoice is still unpaid after all [Smart Retries](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/revenue-recovery/smart-retries) have been attempted, you can configure the subscription to move to `canceled`, `unpaid`, or leave it as `past_due`. To move the subscription to `active`, pay the most recent invoice before its due date. |\n| `canceled` | The subscription has been canceled. During cancellation, automatic collection for all unpaid invoices is disabled (`auto_advance=false`). This is a terminal state that can’t be updated. |\n| `unpaid` | The latest invoice hasn’t been paid but the subscription remains in place. The latest invoice remains open and invoices continue to be generated but payments aren’t attempted. You should revoke access to your product when the subscription is `unpaid` since payments were already attempted and retried when it was `past_due`. To move the subscription to `active`, pay the most recent invoice before its due date. |\n| `paused` | The subscription has ended its trial period without a default payment method and the [`trial_settings.end_behavior.missing_payment_method`](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/trials#create-free-trials-without-payment) is set to `pause`. Invoices will no longer be created for the subscription. After a default payment method has been attached to the customer, you can [resume the subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/trials#resume-a-paused-subscription). |\n\nLearn more about [subscriptions and webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/webhooks).\n\n[](#cancellations)\n\nWith usage-based billing, the bill the customer pays varies based on consumption during the billing cycle. When changing the billing cycle results in ending a subscription interval early, you charge the customer for the usage accrued during the shortened billing cycle. We don’t support [proration](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/prorations) with usage-based billing.\n\nAfter a subscription is canceled, you can’t reactivate it. Instead, you can collect updated billing information from your customer, update their default payment method, and create a new subscription with their existing customer record.\n\nAfter you schedule the cancellation of a subscription using [`cancel_at_period_end`](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/update#update_subscription-cancel_at_period_end), you can reactivate it at any point up to the end of the period by updating `cancel_at_period_end` to `false`. The final invoice includes any metered usage after the subscription cancels at the end of the billing period.\n\n[](#transform-quantities)\n\nUse the [transform\\_quantity option](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices/create#create_price-transform_quantity) to transform usage before applying the price. This allows you to divide the reported usage by a specific number and round the result either up or down. This is commonly used when pricing on packages of a product instead of individual units. Quantity transformation isn’t compatible with [tiered pricing](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/pricing-models#tiered-pricing).\n\nFor example, let’s say you have a car rental service. You report usage as a number of minutes, and you want to charge customers for each hour the car is rented.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/products \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d name=\"Car Rental Service\"`\n\nNext, create a price for the car rental service product, charging 10 USD an hour and rounding up (to charge for a full hour even if only part of the hour is used):\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/prices \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d nickname=\"Car Rental Per Hour Rate\" \\  -d unit_amount=1000 \\  -d currency=usd \\  -d \"recurring[interval]\"=month \\  -d \"recurring[usage_type]\"=metered \\  -d product={{CAR_RENTAL_SERVICE_PRODUCT_ID}} \\   -d \"transform_quantity[divide_by]\"=60 \\  -d \"transform_quantity[round]\"=up`\n\nIf a car is rented for 150 minutes, that customer is charged 30 USD for 3 hours of renting (2 hours and 30 minutes, rounded up).\n\n[](#decimal-amounts)\n\nDecimal pricing is useful if you need to create pricing amounts that aren’t whole numbers. For example, if you’re running a cloud storage SaaS business, you can create a price that charges 0.05 cents for each MB used per month. Based on usage, the quantity of MB is then multiplied by 0.05 cents and rounded to the nearest whole cent.\n\nTo [create prices](https://docs.stripe.com/api#create_price) with decimal amounts, specify `unit_amount_decimal` instead of `unit_amount`. `unit_amount_decimal` allows you to set the amount in the minor unit of the currency that you charge in. For example, you can set `unit_amount_decimal = 105.5` in USD to represent 105.5 cents, or 1.055 USD. `unit_amount_decimal` accepts decimals up to 12 decimal places.\n\nIf you plan to use [tiers](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/pricing-models#tiered-pricing), you can specify `unit_amount_decimal` instead of `unit_amount`. You can also [create invoice items](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoiceitems/create) with `unit_amount_decimal` instead of `unit_amount`.\n\nIn API responses, the integer `unit_amount` field doesn’t populate if you create the object with a decimal value. For example, if you create a price with `unit_amount_decimal = 0.05`, the response contains `unit_amount = null` and `unit_amount_decimal = 0.05`. You can still pass integer values into `unit_amount_decimal`, in which case `unit_amount` is populated in the response. For example, if you create a price with `unit_amount_decimal = 5`, the response contains `unit_amount = 5` and `unit_amount_decimal = 5.0`.\n\n#### Note\n\nIf your integration has event handling that uses `unit_amount` values and you begin using decimal amounts, you need to use `unit_amount_decimal` instead. This is important because `unit_amount` returns as `null` if the decimal amounts can’t be converted into integers, which might cause errors in your integration.\n\n[](#grace-periods)\n\nBy default, Stripe finalizes subscription invoices one hour after they’re [generated](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/invoices/subscription#subscription-renewal). During this one hour grace period, you can continue to report usage for the previous period. When the invoice finalizes, we update it to reflect the latest quantity for its billing period.\n\nUsage reported after the invoice finalizes aren’t captured in future invoices.\n\nIf you’re interested in enabling a longer grace period, contact us at [usage-based-billing@stripe.com](mailto:usage-based-billing@stripe.com).\n\n[](#mid-cycle-updates)\n\nYou can update a subscription item’s price during a billing cycle. However, we only reflect usage occurring after the update on the invoice. Usage occurring before the change won’t be invoiced.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/subscription_items/{{SUBSCRIPTION_ITEM_ID}} \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d price={{NEW_PRICE_ID}}`\n\nAfter the update, we invoice any new usage reported at the new price.\n\nTo delete a subscription item:\n\n`curl -X DELETE https://api.stripe.com/v1/subscription_items/{{SUBSCRIPTION_ITEM_ID}} \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\"`\n\nWe don’t reflect any usage from that item on the invoice.\n\n[](#backdating-subscription-creation)\n\nYou can create backdated subscriptions to start reporting usage before creating a subscription.\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/subscriptions \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\  -d customer={{CUSTOMER_ID}} \\   -d \"items[0][price]\"={{PRICE_ID}} \\   -d backdate_start_date=1711670400`",

Specify which countries to allow shipping to by configuring the [allowed\\_countries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-shipping_address_collection-allowed_countries) property with an array of [two-letter ISO country codes](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-shipping_address_collection-allowed_countries).\n*   To enable billing address collection when you create a Checkout Session, pass [billing\\_address\\_collection=required](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create#create_checkout_session-billing_address_collection).\n\n`const session = await stripe.checkout.sessions.create({   line_items: [     {       price_data: {         currency: 'usd',         product_data: {           name: 'T-shirt',         },         unit_amount: 2000,       },       quantity: 1,     },   ],   mode: 'payment',   ui_mode: 'custom' as any,   return_url: '{{RETURN_URL}}',   billing_address_collection: 'required',   shipping_address_collection: {     allowed_countries: ['US'],   }, });`\n\n[](#render-address-element)\n\nThe Address Element is an embeddable UI component for accepting complete addresses. Use it to collect shipping addresses, or when you need a complete billing address, such as for tax purposes.\n\nYou can collect both shipping and billing addresses by using multiple Address Elements on your page.\n\nIf you prefer to build your own address form, you can [render a custom form](#render-address-element) for address collection.\n\nCreate a container DOM element to mount the Address Element. Then create an instance of the Address Element using [checkout.createElement](https://docs.stripe.com/js/custom_checkout/create_element?type=address) and mount it by calling [element.mount](https://docs.stripe.com/js/element/mount), providing either a CSS selector or the container DOM element. Use [mode](https://docs.stripe.com/js/elements_object/create_address_element#address_element_create-options-mode) to configure whether the Address Element collects billing details or shipping details.\n\n`<div id=\"shipping-address\"></div> <div id=\"billing-address\"></div>`\n\n`const shippingAddressElement = checkout.createElement('address', {mode: 'shipping'}); shippingAddressElement.mount('#shipping-address');  const billingAddressElement = checkout.createElement('address', {mode: 'billing'}); billingAddressElement.mount('#billing-address');`\n\nThe following options are supported:\n\n*   [mode](https://docs.stripe.com/js/elements_object/create_address_element#address_element_create-options-mode)\n*   [contacts](https://docs.stripe.com/js/elements_object/create_address_element#address_element_create-options-contacts)\n*   [display](https://docs.stripe.com/js/elements_object/create_address_element#address_element_create-options-display)\n\n[](#update-an-address-manually)\n\nYou can update billing or shipping information manually by setting [updateBillingAddress](https://docs.stripe.com/js/custom_checkout/react/update_billing_address) or [updateShippingAddress](https://docs.stripe.com/js/custom_checkout/react/update_shipping_address).\n\nIf you are rendering a custom address form, do not call these functions on every change. Instead, call the update functions after your customer has finished inputting the address (e.g., in response to a “save” button).",

  "markdown": "# Link in the Card Element\n\n## Enable checkout using Link with the Card Element.\n\n#### Caution\n\nStripe no longer recommends using the Card Element as part of your Web Elements integration. To integrate Link, use one of our preferred Elements: the Link Authentication Element, Express Checkout Element, or Payment Element.\n\nUse [Link](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link/what-is-link) in the Card Element to save and autofill payment information for your customers, so they don’t need to enter their payment details manually.\n\nThe Card Element can take on two forms: a single line [Card Element](https://docs.stripe.com/js/element/other_element?type=card) or split Elements (like [Card Number](https://docs.stripe.com/js/element/other_element?type=cardNumber), [Expiry](https://docs.stripe.com/js/element/other_element?type=cardExpiry), and [CVC](https://docs.stripe.com/js/element/other_element?type=cardCvc)). When referring to the Card Element, the following information applies to both forms.\n\n## The Link flow ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nWhen Link is enabled, the card input form displays a **Link** button, which an authenticated customer can click to autofill their payment details. They only need to authenticate their account once every 90 days on any Link-enabled business.\n\n![Link autofilling customer payment details](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/link-single-ce-returning-user.e50d94e96551810ac4f95c2fabfd33b9.png)\n\nLink autofilling customer payment details\n\nIf a customer hasn’t signed up for Link and they click the **Link** button, they’re asked to add their email address, phone number, and payment method. A customer can also enter their card details into the Card Element first, and save that card in a Link account.\n\n![A customer signing up for Link](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/link-single-ce-new-user.b8495f2e5258b8cf04b5d43e3a290ec0.png)\n\nA customer signing up for Link\n\nIf a returning Link customer clicks the **Link** button and needs to authenticate, Link asks them to do it with an SMS or email code. After the customer authenticates, Link loads their previously saved payment details, allowing them to check out faster.\n\n![Link authenticating a customer](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/link-in-ce-dialog.ec3340f0aaa847f610249e7dcc3fb7ad.png)\n\nLink authenticating a customer\n\nWe’re continuously optimizing Link to improve checkout conversion, and may selectively show Link when it’s most beneficial to customers at checkout. You can expect to see changes over time, including how and when Link appears.\n\n## Link enablement ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nLink is supported in the [Card Element](https://docs.stripe.com/js/element/other_element?type=card) globally for all businesses with granted access and doesn’t require additional fees or code changes (see note below for details). Link is fully compatible with the other features you receive from card payments.\n\nStripe automatically enables Link in the Card Element. If you want to turn Link off for all instances of the Card Element, visit the Link section of your [payment Method settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) and disable the `Link in Card Element` setting. This setting applies to both forms of the Card Element. To selectively disable Link in the Card Element, use the [disableLink](https://docs.stripe.com/js/elements_object/create_element?type=card#elements_create-options-disableLink) parameter. You only need to use one of these controls—if either `disableLink` is true or Link in the Card Element is disabled in settings, Link won’t appear in the Card Element.\n\nLink _isn’t_ visible in the Card Element if:\n\n*   The parent container that the Card Element is mounted in is too short in height or narrow in width to display the Link button.\n    \n*   The Card Element is displayed on a browser that doesn’t support pop-ups, including in-app browsers. View information about [supported browsers](#test-link-in-the-card-element).\n    \n*   The [Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy) is set to `same-origin`. The Link pop-up must communicate with the page that opened it, so Link in the Card Element isn’t compatible with configurations that block this communication.\n    \n\n#### Note\n\nWe’re releasing Link in the Card Element in phases. Link for the [single line Card Element](https://docs.stripe.com/js/element/other_element?type=card) was released in 2023, followed by Link in [split Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/js/element/other_element?type=cardNumber) in late 2023 and early 2024. Only accounts with granted access can see Link in the Card Element in their [Payment Method settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/link) or use Link in production or test mode. Link isn’t currently supported for Stripe accounts based in India.\n\n## Use the Card Element and Payment Request Button ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nYou can also use Link with the [Payment Request Button](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link/payment-request-button-link). Link in the Card Element operates independently from Link in the Payment Request button. If you use both the Payment Request Button and the Card Element, Link might appear in both during checkout. For more information on when Link appears in the Payment Request Button, see [Link in the Payment Request Button](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/link/payment-request-button-link).\n\n## Link and Connect platforms ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nLink is automatically available to any accounts that access the Card Element through a Connect platform integration. Depending on a platform’s integration, a platform may be able to give its users ([connected accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/enable-payment-acceptance-guide?platform=web#create-account)) the ability to customize their own Link settings in the Dashboard:\n\n### Eligibility requirements for connected platforms ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nIf the following conditions are all met by your platform, then your connected accounts can manage their Link settings directly in their own Dashboard.\n\n*   You use [direct charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/direct-charges).\n    \n*   You create and charge payment methods on your connected accounts.\n    \n*   Your connected accounts have access to the full Stripe Dashboard.\n    \n\nTo set the default state for all connected accounts on your platform:\n\n1.  Click **Edit settings** under **Your connected accounts** in [Payment Method settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect/payment_methods).\n    \n2.  Navigate to **Link in the Card Element** in the Link section.\n    \n\n### Ineligible connected platforms ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\nIn the following cases, Link is controlled by your platform account settings, and your connected accounts can’t customize their Link settings for payments processed through your platform:\n\n*   You create payment methods on your platform and then [clone payment methods](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/connect#cloning-payment-methods) to your connected accounts.\n    \n*   You use [destination charges](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/destination-charges) or [separate charges and transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers).\n    \n*   Your connected accounts don’t have access to the full Stripe Dashboard.\n    \n\nTo manage your platform account settings:\n\n1.  Click **Edit settings** under **Your Account** in [Payment Method settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/connect/payment_methods).\n    \n2.  Navigate to **Link in the Card Element** in the Link section. If you want to turn Link off for only specific connected accounts, you can use the [disableLink](https://docs.stripe.com/js/elements_object/create_element?type=card#elements_create-options-disableLink) parameter.\n    \n\n### Payment processing for connected accounts ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\n*   If your platform offers you the ability to customize your Link settings for platform payments, then you can manage your Link in Card Element settings within [Payment Method settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) by selecting your platform from the dropdown menu at the top of the page.\n    \n*   If your platform isn’t able to offer you settings customization, then the platform determines Link’s availability for all payments processed through the platform, and you won’t have settings control for platform payments in your Dashboard.\n    \n*   For payments you process without a platform, you can manage Link in your [Payment Method settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) by selecting “no platform” from the dropdown menu at the top of the page.\n    \n\n## Test Link in the Card Element ![](https://b.stripecdn.com/docs-statics-srv/assets/fcc3a1c24df6fcffface6110ca4963de.svg) \n\n#### Caution\n\nDon’t store real user data in [test mode](https://docs.stripe.com/test-mode \"test mode\") Link accounts. Treat them as if they’re publicly available, because these test accounts are associated with your publishable key.\n\nLink works with the following browsers:\n\n*   Chrome, Chrome Mobile, and Microsoft Edge.\n    \n*   Safari on desktop and iOS (last 3 major versions).\n    \n\nLink is available in both production and test mode. You can create test mode Link accounts using any valid email address. The following table shows the fixed one-time passcode values that Stripe accepts for authenticating Link test mode accounts:\n\n| Value | Outcome |\n| --- | --- |\n| Any other 6 digits not listed below | Success |\n| 000001 | Error, code invalid |\n| 000002 | Error, code expired |\n| 000003 | Error, max attempts exceeded |\n\nEnabling Link in test mode presents Link on all Card Element test mode sessions that meet the [enablement requirements](#enable-link). In production, Link’s visibility might vary to maximize Link’s conversion benefits in each checkout session.",

If you plan to charge your customer when they’re offline, make sure that your terms also include the following:\n\n*   The customer’s permission for you to initiate a payment or a series of payments on their behalf for specified transactions\n*   The anticipated frequency (one-time or recurring) and timing of payments\n*   How you determine the payment amount\n*   Your cancellation policy, if you’re setting up the payment method for a subscription service\n\nMake sure that you keep a record of your customer’s written agreement to these terms, and only submit charges in accordance with the agreed terms.\n\n[](#web-create-customer)\n\nTo reuse a Naver Pay payment method for future payments, attach it to a [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers \"Customers\").\n\nCreate a [Customer object](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers) when your customer creates an account with your business, and associate the ID of the Customer object with your own internal representation of that customer. Alternatively, you can create a new Customer before saving a payment method for future payments.\n\nCreate a new Customer or retrieve an existing Customer to associate with this payment. Include the following code on your server to create a new Customer:\n\n`curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/customers \\  -u \"`\n\n`sk_test_4eC39HqLyjWDarjtT1zdp7dc`\n\n`:\" \\   --data-urlencode description=\"My First Test Customer (created for API docs)\"`\n\n[](#web-create-checkout-session)\n\nYour customer must authorize you to use their NicePay account for future payments through Stripe Checkout. This allows you to accept Naver Pay payments. Add a checkout button to your website that calls a server-side endpoint to create a [Checkout Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions).\n\n`<html>   <head>     <title>Checkout</title>   </head>   <body>     <form action=\"/create-checkout-session\" method=\"POST\">       <button type=\"submit\">Checkout</button>     </form>   </body> </html>`\n\nCreate a Checkout Session in `setup` mode to collect the required information. After creating the Checkout Session, redirect your customer to the [URL](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/object#checkout_session_object-url) that the response returns.\n\n``Stripe::Checkout::Session.create({   mode: 'setup',   payment_method_types: ['card'],   payment_method_types: ['card', 'naver_pay'],   payment_method_data: {     naver_pay: {       funding: 'point' # or card   },   line_items: [{     price_data: {       currency: 'usd',       # To accept `naver_pay`, all line items must have currency: krw       currency: 'krw',       product_data: {         name: 'T-shirt',       },       unit_amount: 2000,     },     quantity: 1,   }],   success_url: '[https://example.com/success](https://example.com/success)',   cancel_url: '[https://example.com/cancel](https://example.com/cancel)', })``\n\n[](#web-test-integration)\n\nWhile testing your Checkout integration, select **Naver Pay** and click **Pay**. This redirects you to a Stripe-hosted page where you have the choice to authorize or fail the payment. If you authorize the payment, the PaymentIntent switches from `requires_action` to `succeeded`. Failing the test payment makes the PaymentIntent switch from `requires_action` to `requires_payment_method`.

These requirements can differ depending on the account’s country. The Country Specs API makes these rules available to your integration.\n\nYou can also view the information from this API call as [an online guide](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/required-verification-information).\n\n## [Person](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/create)[POST/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/update)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/retrieve)[GET/v1/accounts/:id/persons](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/list)[DELETE/v1/accounts/:id/persons/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/persons/delete)\n\n## [Transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/transfers)\n\nA `Transfer` object is created when you move funds between Stripe accounts as part of Connect.\n\nBefore April 6, 2017, transfers also represented movement of funds from a Stripe account to a card or bank account. This behavior has since been split out into a [Payout](#payout_object) object, with corresponding payout endpoints. For more information, read about the [transfer/payout split](https://docs.stripe.com/transfer-payout-split).\n\nRelated guide: [Creating separate charges and transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/separate-charges-and-transfers)\n\n## [Secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/secret_management)\n\nSecret Store is an API that allows Stripe Apps developers to securely persist secrets for use by UI Extensions and app backends.\n\nThe primary resource in Secret Store is a `secret`. Other apps can’t view secrets created by an app. Additionally, secrets are scoped to provide further permission control.\n\nAll Dashboard users and the app backend share `account` scoped secrets. Use the `account` scope for secrets that don’t change per-user, like a third-party API key.\n\nA `user` scoped secret is accessible by the app backend and one specific Dashboard user. Use the `user` scope for per-user secrets like per-user OAuth tokens, where different users might have different permissions.\n\nRelated guide: [Store data between page reloads](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/store-auth-data-custom-objects)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[GET/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/list)[POST/v1/apps/secrets/delete](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/delete)[GET/v1/apps/secrets/find](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/find)[POST/v1/apps/secrets](https://docs.stripe.com/api/apps/secret_store/set)\n\n## [Reviews](https://docs.stripe.com/api/radar/reviews)\n\nReviews can be used to supplement automated fraud detection with human expertise.\n\nLearn more about [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar) and reviewing payments [here](https://docs.stripe.com/radar/reviews).\n\n## [Authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/update)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/list)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/approve](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/approve)[POST/v1/issuing/authorizations/:id/decline](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/decline)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_create)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/capture](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_capture)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/expire](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_expire)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/finalize\\_amount](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_finalize_amount)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/increment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_increment)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/fraud\\_challenges/respond](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/respond_to_fraud_challenges)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/authorizations/:id/reverse](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/authorizations/test_mode_reverse)\n\n## [Cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/create)[POST/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/update)[GET/v1/issuing/cards/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/retrieve)[GET/v1/issuing/cards](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/list)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/deliver](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_deliver)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/fail](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_fail)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/return](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_return)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/issuing/cards/:id/shipping/ship](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/cards/test_mode_ship)\n\n## [Physical Bundles](https://docs.stripe.com/api/issuing/physical_bundles)\n\nA Physical Bundle represents the bundle of physical items - card stock, carrier letter, and envelope - that is shipped to a cardholder when you create a physical card.\n\n## [Reader](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers)\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/terminal/readers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/create)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/update)[GET/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/retrieve)[GET/v1/terminal/readers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/list)[DELETE/v1/terminal/readers/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/delete)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/cancel\\_action](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/cancel_action)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/collect\\_inputs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/collect_inputs)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/confirm\\_payment\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/confirm_payment_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/collect\\_payment\\_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/collect_payment_method)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/process\\_payment\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/process_payment_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/process\\_setup\\_intent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/process_setup_intent)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/refund\\_payment](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/refund_payment)[POST/v1/terminal/readers/:id/set\\_reader\\_display](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/set_reader_display)[POST/v1/test\\_helpers/terminal/readers/:id/present\\_payment\\_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/readers/present_payment_method)\n\n## [Terminal Hardware Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_products)Preview feature\n\nA TerminalHardwareProduct is a category of hardware devices that are generally similar, but may have variations depending on the country it’s shipped to.\n\nTerminalHardwareSKUs represent variations within the same Product (for example, a country specific device). For example, WisePOS E is a TerminalHardwareProduct and a WisePOS E - US and WisePOS E - UK are TerminalHardwareSKUs.\n\n## [Terminal Hardware SKU](https://docs.stripe.com/api/terminal/hardware_skus)Preview feature\n\nA TerminalHardwareSKU represents a SKU for Terminal hardware. A SKU is a representation of a product available for purchase, containing information such as the name, price, and images.\n\n## [Transaction Entries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/treasury/transaction_entries)\n\nTransactionEntries represent individual units of money movements within a single [Transaction](#transactions).\n\n## [Scheduled Queries](https://docs.stripe.com/api/sigma/scheduled_queries)\n\nIf you have [scheduled a Sigma query](https://docs.stripe.com/sigma/scheduled-queries), you’ll receive a `sigma.scheduled_query_run.created` webhook each time the query runs. The webhook contains a `ScheduledQueryRun` object, which you can use to retrieve the query results.\n\n## [Report Types](https://docs.stripe.com/api/reporting/report_type)\n\nThe Report Type resource corresponds to a particular type of report, such as the “Activity summary” or “Itemized payouts” reports. These objects are identified by an ID belonging to a set of enumerated values. See [API Access to Reports documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/reporting/statements/api) for those Report Type IDs, along with required and optional parameters.\n\nNote that certain report types can only be run based on your live-mode data (not test-mode data), and will error when queried without a [live-mode API key](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#test-live-modes).\n\n## [Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/financial_connections/sessions)\n\nA Financial Connections Session is the secure way to programmatically launch the client-side Stripe.js modal that lets your users link their accounts.\n\n## [Verification Report](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_reports)\n\nA VerificationReport is the result of an attempt to collect and verify data from a user. The collection of verification checks performed is determined from the `type` and `options` parameters used. You can find the result of each verification check performed in the appropriate sub-resource: `document`, `id_number`, `selfie`.\n\nEach VerificationReport contains a copy of any data collected by the user as well as reference IDs which can be used to access collected images through the [FileUpload](https://docs.stripe.com/api/files) API. To configure and create VerificationReports, use the [VerificationSession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_sessions) API.\n\nRelated guide: [Accessing verification results](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verification-sessions#results).\n\n## [Crypto Onramp Quotes](https://docs.stripe.com/api/crypto/onramp_quotes)\n\nCrypto Onramp Quotes are estimated quotes for onramp conversions into all the different cryptocurrencies on different networks. The Quotes API allows you to display quotes in your product UI before directing the user to the onramp widget.\n\nRelated guide: [Quotes API](https://docs.stripe.com/crypto/quotes-api)\n\n## [Climate Product](https://docs.stripe.com/api/climate/product)\n\nA Climate product represents a type of carbon removal unit available for reservation. You can retrieve it to see the current price and availability.\n\n## [Forwarding Request](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/request)\n\nInstructs Stripe to make a request on your behalf using the destination URL. The destination URL is activated by Stripe at the time of onboarding. Stripe verifies requests with your credentials provided during onboarding, and injects card details from the payment\\_method into the request.\n\nStripe redacts all sensitive fields and headers, including authentication credentials and card numbers, before storing the request and response data in the forwarding Request object, which are subject to a 30-day retention period.\n\nYou can provide a Stripe idempotency key to make sure that requests with the same key result in only one outbound request. The Stripe idempotency key provided should be unique and different from any idempotency keys provided on the underlying third-party request.\n\nForwarding Requests are synchronous requests that return a response or time out according to Stripe’s limits.\n\nRelated guide: [Forward card details to third-party API endpoints](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/forwarding).\n\nEndpoints\n\n[POST/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/create)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests/:id](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/retrieve)[GET/v1/forwarding/requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/forwarding_requests/list)",
