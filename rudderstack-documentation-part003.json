From the list of destinations, select **Post Affiliate Pro**.\n*   Assign a name to the destination and click **Continue**.\n\n### Connection settings\n\nThe connection settings required to configure Post Affiliate Pro as a destination in RudderStack are listed below:\n\n[![Post Affiliate Pro connection settings](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/pap-connection-settings-1.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/pap-connection-settings-1.webp)\n\n[![Post Affiliate Pro connection settings](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/pap-connection-settings-2.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/pap-connection-settings-2.webp)\n\n[![Post Affiliate Pro connection settings](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/pap-connection-settings-3.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/pap-connection-settings-3.webp)\n\n*   **URL of Post Affiliate Pro**: Enter your Post Affiliate Pro tracking URL here.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> For more information on getting the Post Affiliate Pro URL, refer to the [FAQ](#faq) section below.\n\n*   **Account ID**: Enter your network merchant account ID here.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Post Affiliate Pro owners will have this value set to `default1`.\n\n*   **Param Name User ID**: If you have changed the **Affiliate ID / Referrer ID** parameter value by going to **Configuration** - **URL Parameter Names** in your Post Affiliate Pro dashboard, this new value should be entered here.\n    \n*   **Cookie Domain**: Enter your cookie domain name here. You can find this setting by going to your Post Affiliate Pro dashboard and navigating to **Configuration** - **Cookies**:\n    \n\n[![Post Affiliate Pro cookie domain setting](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/pap-cookie-domain.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/pap-cookie-domain.webp)\n\n*   **Cookie to Custom Field**: Enter the ID of the field where the cookie will be written.\n    \n*   **Campaign to Custom Field**: Enter the ID of the field where the campaign value will be written.\n    \n*   **Affiliate to Custom Field**: Enter the ID of the field where the affiliate ID will be written.\n    \n\n#### Affiliate to Link settings\n\n*   **Affiliate Link ID**: Enter your affiliate link ID here, e.g. `affiliateId`. This refers to the ID of the DOM object where the Affiliate ID is added.\n    \n*   **AffiliateId Parameter Name**: Enter your affiliate ID parameter name, e.g. `a_aid`.\n    \n\nSuppose you set the **Affiliate Link ID** to `affiliateId` and **AffiliateId Parameter Name** to `aff_id`. Then, the anchor link of the domain where you want to send the affiliate/referrer ID will be converted from: `[](http://abcd.com)` to: `[\"id=\"affiliateId\">](http://abcd.com/?aff_id=<the_affiliate_id>)`.\n\n#### Cookie to Link settings\n\n*   **Cookie Link ID**: Enter your cookie link ID here. This refers to the ID of the DOM object where the cookie ID is added.\n    \n*   **Cookie Parameter Name**: Enter the cookie parameter name here.\n    \n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> These settings are similar to the **Affiliate to Link** settings, except that the cookie will be written in place of the `affiliateId`.\n\n#### Event tracking settings\n\n*   **Merge Products**: This setting determines if RudderStack should merge the product information while making a sale call to Post Affiliate Pro. If disabled, an individual sale object will be created for each product.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Refer to the [Merging product information during sales tracking](#sales-tracking) section for more information on this feature.\n\n*   **Disable Tracking Method**: Disable this setting to disable flash cookie creation.\n    \n*   **List of Events for Click**: For [Clicks Tracking](https://support.qualityunit.com/417400-Clicks-referrals-tracking), RudderStack will consider only the events listed in this field.\n    \n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> Make sure the event names specified in this field are comma-separated.\n\n*   As this is a destination that supports sending events only via web device mode, the **Use device mode to send events** option will be always enabled.\n\nFinally, click **Next** to complete the setup. Post Affiliate Pro will now be enabled as a destination in RudderStack.\n\n## Identify\n\nYou can use the RudderStack `identify` method to set a unique customer ID. You can then use this ID to subsequently track the customer’s activities.\n\nA sample `identify` call is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify(\n  \"user001\", // visitor Id\n);\n```\n\nRudderStack calls the `setVisitorId` function of the Post Affiliate Pro SDK and sets the user ID provided in the `identify` call:\n\n```\nPostAffTracker.setVisitorId(\"user001\");\n```\n\n## Track\n\nRudderStack supports two types of event tracking for Post Affiliate Pro:\n\n*   **Clicks tracking**: RudderStack initiates Post Affiliate Pro’s clicks tracking mechanism for the events that are explicitly specified in the **List of Events for Click** field, while setting up the integration.\n    \n*   **Sales tracking**: RudderStack initiates Post Affiliate Pro’s sales tracking only for the **Order Completed** event.\n    \n\n### Clicks tracking\n\nA sample `track` event for clicks tracking is as shown:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\n\"User Clicked\", //event name\n{\n      affiliateId: \"affiliate id\",\n      bannerId: \"banner id\",\n      campaignId: \"campaign id\",\n      channel: \"channel\",\n      data1: \"data1\",\n      data2: \"data2\",\n} //properties\n);\n```\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> The **User Clicked** event must be explictly specified in the **List of Events for Click** field. Otherwise, the event will be discarded.\n\nRudderStack maps the following properties to the Post Affiliate Pro click event properties:\n\n| **RudderStack Event Property** | **Post Affiliate Pro Property** |\n| --- | --- |\n| `data1` | `Data1` |\n| `data2` | `Data2` |\n| `affiliateId` | `AffiliateID` |\n| `bannerId` | `BannerID` |\n| `campaignId` | `CampaignID` |\n| `channel` | `Channel` |\n\n### Sales tracking\n\nIn case of sales tracking, RudderStack creates a Post Affiliate Pro `sale` object. For the properties in the event, RudderStack then calls the respective `sale` object function.\n\nA sample `Order Completed` event sent to Post Affiliate Pro sales tracking is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\n\"Order Completed\", //event name\n{\n      checkout_id: \"12345\",\n      order_id: \"1234\",\n      affiliation: \"aff_id\",\n      total: 17.45,\n      fixedCost: 20.5,\n      revenue: 15.0,\n      customCommision: 15,\n      campaign: \"campaignId\",\n      channel: \"channelId\",\n      coupon: \"ImagePro\",\n      currency: \"EUR\",\n      status: \"A\",\n      data1: \"something\",\n      data2: \"something\",\n      data3: \"something\",\n      data4: \"something\",\n      data5: \"something\",\n      doNotDeleteCookies: true,\n\n      products: [\n        {\n          product_id: \"123\",\n          sku: \"G-5\",\n          name: \"Product1\",\n          price: 14,\n          fixedCost: 20.5,\n          quantity: 1,\n          customCommision: 10.23,\n          category: \"Miscellaneous\",\n          currency: \"USD\",\n          commisionStatus: \"A\",\n          url: \"https://www.website.com/product/path\",\n          image_url: \"https://www.website.com/product/path.jpg\",\n        },\n        {\n          product_id: \"345\",\n          sku: \"F-5\",\n          name: \"Product2\",\n          price: 2.45,\n          fixedCost: 5.0,\n          quantity: 2,\n          customCommision: 10.50,\n          commisionStatus: \"A\",\n          category: \"General\",\n        },\n      ],\n} //properties\n);\n```\n\nWhen the **Merge Products** option is enabled while configuring the destination in the dashboard, RudderStack merges the product information and sends the `sale` object as seen in the Post Affiliate Pro dashboard below:\n\n[![Post Affiliate Pro sale object with combined product information](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/pap-mergeproduct-true.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/pap-mergeproduct-true.webp)\n\nIf this option is disabled, two separate `sale` objects are created and sent to Post Affiliate Pro:\n\n[![Post Affiliate Pro separate sale objects](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/pap-mergeproduct-false.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/pap-mergeproduct-false.webp)\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### Where do I get the Post Affiliate Pro URL?\n\nTo get your Post Affiliate Pro URL, follow these steps:\n\n1.  Log into your Post Affiliate Pro merchant website.\n2.  Then, click **Tools** and go to **Integration**.\n3.  Under **Main Integration Steps**, choose any one of the **Clicks tracking** or **Sales/Leads Tracking** options.\n4.  Finally, copy the `src` part as shown below:\n\n[![Post Affiliate Pro tracking URL](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/pap-tracking-url.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/pap-tracking-url.webp)\n\nQuestions?

    "markdown": "# Redis | RudderStack Docs\n\nSend events from RudderStack to Redis.\n\n* * *\n\n*     4 minute read  \n    \n\n[Redis](https://redis.io/) is an open source, in-memory data structure store. You can use it as a database and a message broker.\n\nRudderStack stores all traits of your user as a [Redis hash](https://redis.io/commands/hset), allowing you to access user profiles in real-time.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> Note that:\n> \n> *   This integration only accepts [Identify](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/identify/) calls. RudderStack ignores all other event types.\n> *   It is highly recommended that you keep your Redis instance within a private network and make it accessible to RudderStack.\n\nFind the open source transformer code for this destination in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-transformer/tree/master/src/v0/destinations/redis).\n\n## Getting started\n\n1.  From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add the source. Then, from the list of destinations, select **Redis**.\n2.  Assign a name to the destination and click **Continue**.\n\n### Connection settings\n\nTo successfully configure Redis as a destination, you will need to configure the following settings:\n\n*   **Address**: Enter the address of your Redis instance.\n*   **Password**: Enter the password for your Redis instance.\n*   **Database**: Enter the database name of your Redis instance where RudderStack should store the user traits. You can use this setting to configure a different database in your Redis instance.\n*   **Cluster Mode**: Enable this setting if you’re connecting to a Redis cluster within a multi-node RudderStack setup.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> Note that if you enable **Cluster Mode**:\n> \n> *   You need to specify multiple host addresses in a comma separated format in the **Address** field.\n> *   RudderStack automatically disables the **Database** option.\n\n*   **Secure**: Enable this setting to secure the TLS communication between RudderStack Redis client and your Redis server.\n    *   **Skip verify**: Enable this option to skip the client’s verification of the server’s certificate chain and host name. In this mode, TLS is susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks. Use this option **only** for testing.\n    *   **CA certificate**: Enter the certificate which needs to be verified while establishing a secure connection. Skip this setting if the Root CA of your server can be verified with any client, for example, Elasticache.\n*   **Prefix**: By default, RudderStack stores user traits with the key `user:<user_id>`. You can specify an extra prefix to distinguish all RudderStack-stored keys.\n*   **OneTrust Cookie Categories**: This setting lets you associate the [OneTrust](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/data-governance/consent-management/onetrust/) cookie consent groups to Redis.\n\n## Identify\n\nYou can use the [`identify`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/identify/) call to identify a visiting user and associate them to their actions. It also lets you record the traits about them like their name, email address, etc.\n\nRudderStack stores the user traits in the Redis instance configured in the [connection settings](#connection-settings). You can access the latest user traits by querying Redis for the key `user:<user_id>`.\n\nA sample `identify` call is shown below:\n\n```\n// Identify a user with name and title as traits\n\nrudderanalytics.identify(\"1hKOmRA4GRlm\", {\n  name: \"Alex Keener\",\n  title: \"CEO\",\n})\n```\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> `userId` is a required field for RudderStack to successfully send the `identify` events to Redis.\n\nThe following snippet highlights how it is stored in Redis:\n\n```\n// redis-cli\nredis> HGETALL user:1hKOmRA4GRlm\n1) \"name\"\n2) \"Alex Keener\"\n3) \"title\"\n4) \"CEO\"\n```\n\n### Nested properties\n\nIf your user traits have nested properties, RudderStack flattens them with `.` as the separator.\n\nConsider the following event:\n\n```\n// Identify a user with location as a trait\n\nrudderanalytics.identify(\"1hKOmRA4GRlm\", {\n  location: {\n    state: \"Texas\",\n    city: \"Austin\",\n  },\n})\n```\n\nRudderStack flattens the properties as follows:\n\n```\n// redis-cli\nredis> HGETALL user:1hKOmRA4GRlm\n1) \"location.state\"\n2) \"Texas\"\n3) \"location.city\"\n4) \"Austin\"\n```\n\n### Custom prefix\n\nIf you specify a prefix while setting up your Redis destination, RudderStack uses it to prefix all the keys.\n\nFor example, if you specify the prefix `rudderstack` in the RudderStack dashboard setting and send the following call:\n\n```\n// Identify a user with name and title as traits\n\nrudderanalytics.identify(\"1hKOmRA4GRlm\", {\n  age: 23,\n})\n```\n\nThe corresponding Redis CLI output is prefixed with `rudderstack` as shown below:\n\n```\n// redis-cli\nredis> HGETALL rudderstack:user:1hKOmRA4GRlm\n1) \"age\"\n2) 23\n```\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### How do I set up Redis on Docker with TLS support?\n\nTo enable a TLS endpoint for accessing Redis, run a `redis-stunnel` container with a link to your Redis container and expose the TLS port. For more details, see [redis-stunnel usage](https://hub.docker.com/r/runnable/redis-stunnel/).\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> *   Set **Common Name** to `localhost` while generating the CA certificate and server certificates.\n> *   Set the TLS endpoint of the `redis-stunnel` container as the **Address** in your [destination settings](#connection-settings).\n\nFor example, see the following Redis destination settings:\n\n[![](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/redis-example-settings.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/redis-example-settings.webp)\n\nHere, `127.0.0.1:6380` is the address used while running containers locally with default values. You can specify the contents of the [generated `ca.pem` file](https://hub.docker.com/r/runnable/redis-stunnel/#:~:text=for%20accessing%20Redis.-,Usage,-The%20easiest%20setup) in the **CA certificate** field.\n\nQuestions?

Otherwise, it is created by the `groupId`.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack removes the `groupType` field from the traits and passes them to PostHog as the group properties.\n\nIn device mode, RudderStack calls the [group analytics](https://posthog.com/docs/integrate/client/js#group-analytics) function to create a group in PostHog. It also uses the [PostHog Super Properties](https://posthog.com/docs/integrate/client/js#super-properties) to assign the group to an identified user.\n\nThe traits mapping is summarized in the following table:\n\n| RudderStack group trait | Updated group mapping disabled | Updated group mapping enabled |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `groupId`  <br>Required | `groupId` | `$group_key` |\n| `groupType`  <br>Required | `groupType` | `$group_type` |\n\n## Alias\n\nCalling [`alias`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/alias/) passes `userId` and `previousId` to the PostHog queue.\n\nA sample `alias` call in RudderStack is as shown:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.alias(\"user01\", \"previous01\")\n```\n\nIn the above example, `previous01` gets mapped to `distinct id` in PostHog, while `user01` gets mapped to `alias` in PostHog.\n\nFor the `alias` call, RudderStack sends `$create_alias` as an event to PostHog according to [PostHog Alias API](https://posthog.com/docs/api/post-only-endpoints#alias).\n\n## Property mappings\n\nRudderStack also maps the following properties to the PostHog standard contextual properties:\n\n| RudderStack field | PostHog field |\n| --- | --- |\n| `context.os.name` | `$os` |\n| `context.page.url` | `$current_url` |\n| `url` | `$host` |\n| `context.page.path` | `$pathname` |\n| `context.screen.height` | `$screen_height` |\n| `context.screen.width` | `$screen_width` |\n| `context.library.name` | `$lib` |\n| `context.library.version` | `$lib_version` |\n| `timestamp`  <br>`originalTimestamp` | `$time` |\n| `context.device.id` | `$device_id` |\n| `request_ip`  <br>`context.ip` | `$ip` |\n| `timestamp`  <br>`originalTimestamp` | `$timestamp` |\n| `anonymousId` | `$anon_distinct_id` |\n| `userId`  <br>`anonymousId` | `distinct_id` |\n| `context.screen.density` | `$screen_density` |\n| `context.device.manufacturer` | `$device_manufacturer` |\n| `context.os.version` | `$os_version` |\n| `context.timezone` | `$timezone` |\n| `context.locale` | `$locale` |\n| `context.userAgent` | `$useragent` |\n| `context.app.version` | `$app_version` |\n| `context.device.name` | `$device_name` |\n| `context.network.carrier` | `$network_carrier` |\n| `context.app.name` | `$app_name` |\n| `context.device.model` | `$device_model` |\n| `context.app.namespace` | `$app_namespace` |\n| `context.app.build` | `$app_build` |\n| `properties.viewport_height` | `$viewport_height` |\n| `properties.viewport_width` | `$viewport_width` |\n| `context.page.loaded` | `$performance_page_loaded` |\n| `context.campaign.source` | `utm_source` |\n| `context.campaign.medium` | `utm_medium` |\n| `context.campaign.name` | `utm_campaign` |\n| `context.campaign.content` | `utm_content` |\n| `context.campaign.term` | `utm_term` |\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> The PostHog SDK autogenerates the property `$insert_id` when you send event via the RudderStack device mode.\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### How can I prevent RudderStack from loading the PostHog SDK on my website?\n\nTo prevent RudderStack from loading the PostHog SDK on your website, you can [load the JavaScript SDK](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/load-js-sdk/) as shown:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.load(\"WRITE_KEY\", \"DATA_PLANE_URL\", {\n  integrations: {\n    All: true,\n    POSTHOG: {\n      loadIntegration: false,\n    },\n  },\n});\n```\n\n#### How do I set the RudderStack event’s `anonymousId` as the PostHog `anonymous_id`?\n\nTo set `anonymousId` in your RudderStack event as the PostHog `anonymous_id`, call PostHog’s [`identify` function](https://posthog.com/docs/data/identify) using the RudderStack `anonymousId`.\n\nQuestions?

To use this feature, enable the **Use Updated Mapping for Group calls** setting in the RudderStack dashboard:\n\n[![PostHog group mapping setting](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/posthog-updated-group-mapping.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/posthog-updated-group-mapping.webp)\n\nBy default, the **Use Updated Mapping for Group calls** setting is disabled in the dashboard. In this case, RudderStack sends the group traits to PostHog as received without any modification, as shown in the following snippet:\n\n```\n{\n  \"version\": \"1\",\n  \"type\": \"REST\",\n  \"method\": \"POST\",\n  \"endpoint\": \"https://app.posthog.com/batch\",\n  \"headers\": {\n    \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\"\n  },\n  \"params\": {},\n  \"body\": {\n    \"JSON\": {\n      \"groupId\": \"groupId27\",\n      \"distinct_id\": \"sampleusrRudder7\",\n      \"traits\": {\n        \"groupType\": \"company\",\n        \"KEY_3\": {\n          \"CHILD_KEY_92\": \"value_95\",\n          \"CHILD_KEY_102\": \"value_103\"\n        },\n        \"name_trait\": \"Company\",\n        \"value_trait\": \"Company-ABC\"\n      },\n      \"messageId\": \"e5034df0-a404-47b4-a463-76df99934fea\",\n      \"event\": \"$group\",\n      \"api_key\": \"LNDs0JGdwbknNGolFc4HdoAE\",\n      \"type\": \"group\"\n    },\n  },\n}\n```\n\nWhen **Use Updated Mapping for Group calls** is enabled in the dashboard, RudderStack sends the group traits as event properties to PostHog:\n\n```\n{\n  \"version\": \"1\",\n  \"type\": \"REST\",\n  \"method\": \"POST\",\n  \"endpoint\": \"https://app.posthog.com/batch\",\n  \"headers\": {\n    \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\"\n  },\n  \"params\": {},\n  \"body\": {\n    \"JSON\": {\n      \"distinct_id\": \"sampleusrRudder7\",\n      \"messageId\": \"e5034df0-a404-47b4-a463-76df99934fea\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"$group_key\": \"groupId27\",\n        \"$group_type\": \"company\",\n        \"$group_set\": {\n          \"KEY_3\": {\n            \"CHILD_KEY_92\": \"value_95\",\n            \"CHILD_KEY_102\": \"value_103\"\n          },\n          \"name_trait\": \"Company\",\n          \"value_trait\": \"Comapny-ABC\"\n        },\n      },\n      \"event\": \"$group\",\n      \"api_key\": \"LNDs0JGdwbknNGolFc4HdoAE\",\n      \"type\": \"group\"\n    },\n  },\n}\n```\n\nThe mapping is summarized in the following table:\n\n| RudderStack group trait | Updated group mapping disabled | Updated group mapping enabled |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `groupId` | `groupId` | `$group_key` |\n| `groupType` | `groupType` | `$group_type` |\n| `traits` | `traits` | `$group_set` |\n\n## Alias\n\nCalling [`alias`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/alias/) passes `userId` and `previousId` to the PostHog queue.\n\nA sample `alias` call in RudderStack is as shown:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.alias(\"user01\", \"previous01\")\n```\n\nIn the above example, `previous01` gets mapped to `distinct id` in PostHog, while `user01` gets mapped to `alias` in PostHog.\n\nFor the `alias` call, RudderStack sends `$create_alias` as an event to PostHog according to [PostHog Alias API](https://posthog.com/docs/api/post-only-endpoints#alias).\n\n## Property mappings\n\nRudderStack also maps the following properties to the PostHog standard contextual properties:\n\n| RudderStack field | PostHog field |\n| --- | --- |\n| `context.os.name` | `$os` |\n| `context.page.url` | `$current_url` |\n| `url` | `$host` |\n| `context.page.path` | `$pathname` |\n| `context.screen.height` | `$screen_height` |\n| `context.screen.width` | `$screen_width` |\n| `context.library.name` | `$lib` |\n| `context.library.version` | `$lib_version` |\n| `timestamp`  <br>`originalTimestamp` | `$time` |\n| `context.device.id` | `$device_id` |\n| `request_ip`  <br>`context.ip` | `$ip` |\n| `timestamp`  <br>`originalTimestamp` | `$timestamp` |\n| `anonymousId` | `$anon_distinct_id` |\n| `userId`  <br>`anonymousId` | `distinct_id` |\n| `context.screen.density` | `$screen_density` |\n| `context.device.manufacturer` | `$device_manufacturer` |\n| `context.os.version` | `$os_version` |\n| `context.timezone` | `$timezone` |\n| `context.locale` | `$locale` |\n| `context.userAgent` | `$useragent` |\n| `context.app.version` | `$app_version` |\n| `context.device.name` | `$device_name` |\n| `context.network.carrier` | `$network_carrier` |\n| `context.app.name` | `$app_name` |\n| `context.device.model` | `$device_model` |\n| `context.app.namespace` | `$app_namespace` |\n| `context.app.build` | `$app_build` |\n| `properties.viewport_height` | `$viewport_height` |\n| `properties.viewport_width` | `$viewport_width` |\n| `context.page.loaded` | `$performance_page_loaded` |\n| `context.campaign.source` | `utm_source` |\n| `context.campaign.medium` | `utm_medium` |\n| `context.campaign.name` | `utm_campaign` |\n| `context.campaign.content` | `utm_content` |\n| `context.campaign.term` | `utm_term` |\n\nQuestions?

From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add a source. Then, from the list of destinations, select **Revenue Cat**.\n2.  Assign a name to the destination and click **Continue**.\n\n### Connection settings\n\nTo successfully configure Revenue Cat as a destination, you will need to configure the following settings:\n\n[![Revenue Cat connection settings](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/rev-cat-connection-settings.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/rev-cat-connection-settings.webp)\n\n*   **Public API Key**: Enter your Revenue Cat public API key.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> For more information on getting your Revenue Cat public API key, refer to the [FAQ](#faq) section below.\n\n*   **X-Platform**: Select your app platform from the dropdown.\n\n## Identify\n\nThe [`identify`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/identify/) method lets you identify a user and associate them to their actions. It also lets you record any traits about them like their name, email, etc.\n\nRudderStack uses the `identify` call to create or update new subscribers in Revenue Cat. It maps `userId` (a required trait in every event) to Revenue Cat’s `app_user_id` before sending the data via the [`subscribers`](https://docs.revenuecat.com/reference/subscribers) API.\n\nA sample `identify` call is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify(\"1hKOmRA4GRlm\",{\n    email: \"alex@example.com\",\n    phone: \"+1-202-555-0146\",\n})\n```\n\n### Traits mapping\n\nRudderStack maps the following `identify` traits to the corresponding Revenue Cat attributes:\n\n| RudderStack trait | Revenue Cat attribute |\n| --- | --- |\n| `userId` (Required) | `app_user_id` |\n| `name` | `$displayName` |\n| `email` | `$email` |\n| `phone` | `$phoneNumber` |\n| `apnsTokens` | `$apnsTokens` |\n| `fcmTokens` | `$fcmTokens` |\n| `context.ip`, `request_ip` | `$ip` |\n| `appsflyerId` | `$appsflyerId` |\n| `iterableUserId` | `$iterableUserId` |\n| `mparticleId` | `$mparticleId` |\n| `onesignalId` | `$onesignalId` |\n| `airshipChannelId` | `$airshipChannelId` |\n| `clevertapId` | `$clevertapId` |\n\nThe following `identify` traits are also mapped to the corresponding Revenue Cat attributes:\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> Revenue Cat **cannot modify** these attributes so you must send them **only once**.\n\n| RudderStack trait | Revenue Cat attribute |\n| --- | --- |\n| `idfa`/ `advertisingId` | `$idfa` |\n| `idfv`/ `device.id` | `$idfv` |\n| `gpsAdId` | `$gpsAdId` |\n| `advertisingId` | `$androidId` |\n| `campaign.name` | `$campaign` |\n| `creative` | `$creative` |\n| `keyword` | `$keyword` |\n| `mediaSource` | `$mediaSource` |\n| `ad` | `$ad` |\n| `addGroup` | `$adGroup` |\n| `adjustId` | `$adjustId` |\n| `fbAnonId` | `$fbAnonId` |\n| `iterableCampaignId` | `$iterableCampaignId` |\n| `iterableTemplateId` | `$iterableTemplateId` |\n| `mixpanelDistinctId` | `$mixpanelDistinctId` |\n| `amazonAdId` | `$amazonAdId` |\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> The values for `iterableCampaignId` and `iterableTemplateId` must be valid non-negative, non-decimal integers. Otherwise, RudderStack will reject and skip these fields.\n\n## Track\n\nThe [`track`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/track/) method lets you capture user events along with the properties associated with them.\n\nA sample `track` call is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"Order Completed\", {\n  userId: \"1hKOmRA4GRlm\",\n  currency: \"USD\",\n  fetch_token: \"12456\",\n  products: [{\n      product_id: \"123454387\",\n      name: \"Game\",\n      price: 15.99,\n      introductory_price: \"24\",\n      is_restore: true,\n      presented_offering_identifier: \"123\",\n    }\n  ],\n});\n```\n\n### Event mapping\n\nRudderStack maps the `Order Completed` event to Revenue Cat’s `Purchase` event before sending it across via the [`receipts`](https://docs.revenuecat.com/reference/receipts) API. To do so, RudderStack requires the `userId` (mapped to `app_user_id`) and `fetch_token` properties to be present in the event.\n\n### Property mapping\n\nRudderStack maps the following event properties to the corresponding Revenue Cat attributes:\n\n| RudderStack property | Revenue Cat attribute | Comments |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `userId` (Required) | `app_user_id` | \\-  |\n| `fetch_token` (Required) | `fetch_token` | This must be a Base64 encoded **receipt file** for iOS, **receipt token** for Android, **receipt** for Amazon, and **subscription token** in case of Stripe. |\n| `currency` | `currency` | \\-  |\n| `payment_mode` | `payment_mode` | \\-  |\n| `product_id`, `products.product_id` | `product_id` | This is required for Google and should be the Apple, Google, or Amazon SKU or product identifier. |\n| `price` | `price` | \\-  |\n| `introductory_price` | `introductory_price` | \\-  |\n| `is_restore` | `is_restore` | \\-  |\n| `presented_offering_identifier` | `presented_offering_identifier` | \\-  |\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### Where can I find the Revenue Cat public API key?\n\nTo find the Revenue Cat public API key, follow these steps:\n\n1.  Log into your [Revenue Cat dashboard](https://app.revenuecat.com/).\n2.

It lets you design personalized digital marketing campaigns to engage with users throughout their product journey.\n\nFind the open source transformer code for this destination in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-transformer/tree/master/src/v0/destinations/sfmc).\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nBefore configuring SFMC as a destination in RudderStack, make sure to:\n\n*   [Set up the data extensions](#create-data-extensions)\n*   [Generate the required credentials](#generate-credentials-to-send-data) for RudderStack to send data to SFMC.\n\n### Create data extensions\n\nIt is highly recommended to [create a data extension](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_cab_create_a_new_data_extension.htm&type=5) to store the `identify` and `track` calls coming from RudderStack. You must also create the required attributes in your data extension for each trait (`identify` events) or properties (`track` events) before sending them to SFMC.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> SFMC ignores any traits/properties that are not mapped to the data extension attributes.\n\nFor example, if you send an event property like `\"phone\": \"+1-202-555-0146\"` but there is no matching phone column in your SFMC data extension, the property is ignored.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Create all the attributes in the data extension in title case regardless of the casing used for the trait/property names in your RudderStack `identify`/`track` events.\n> \n> RudderStack automatically formats the field names into title case before sending the events to SFMC.\n\nWhen creating data extensions, make sure to check the **Is Sendable** option if you want to send emails or push notifications based on your events.\n\n[![](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/sfmc-data-extension-1.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/sfmc-data-extension-1.webp)\n\nThe primary key for the Identify data extension is called as the [contact key or subscriber key](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.mc_mp_use_case_subscriber_key.htm&type=5). You must add a primary key called **Contact Key** for your data extension before sending data to SFMC. RudderStack populates this field with the `userId` or `email` (if `userId` is absent) traits in the [`identify`](#identify) event.\n\n[![](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/sfmc-data-extension-2.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/sfmc-data-extension-2.webp)\n\nFor `track` calls, you can set up different primary keys for various events. If you do not set any primary key, RudderStack sets the default primary key to **Contact Key**. You can specify multiple comma-separated primary keys if you have defined multiple primary keys in your data extension. See the following sections for more information:\n\n*   [Map `track` events to primary key](#mapping-events-to-primary-key)\n*   [Set UUID as primary key](#setting-uuid-as-primary-key)\n\n### Generate credentials to send data\n\n1.  In your [SFMC dashboard](https://mc.exacttarget.com/cloud/), go to **Apps** > **Installed Packages**.\n\n[![SFMC installed packages](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/sfmc-installed-packages.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/sfmc-installed-packages.webp)\n\n2.  Create a new package. Then, go to the package and click **Add Component**.\n\n[![Add new component in SFMC package](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/sfmc-add-component.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/sfmc-add-component.webp)\n\n3.  Choose **API Integration** as the component type and click **Next**.\n\n[![API Integration component type](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/sfmc-component-type.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/sfmc-component-type.webp)\n\n4.  Select the integration type as **Server-to-Server** and click **Next**.\n\n[![S2S Integration type](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/sfmc-integration-type.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/sfmc-integration-type.webp)\n\n5.  Note the client ID and secret for this package (listed under **API Integration**). Specify these credentials in the [connection settings](#connection-settings) while setting up the SFMC destination in RudderStack.\n\n## Get started\n\nRudderStack supports sending event data to Salesforce Marketing Cloud via the following [connection modes](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/):\n\n| Connection Mode | Web | Mobile | Server |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Device mode** | \\-  | \\-  | \\-  |\n| **Cloud mode** | **Supported** | **Supported** | **Supported** |\n\nOnce you have confirmed that the source platform supports sending events to Salesforce Marketing Cloud, follow these steps:\n\n1.  From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add the source. Then, from the list of destinations, select **Salesforce Marketing Cloud**.\n2.  Assign a name to the destination and click **Continue**.\n\n### Connection settings\n\nTo successfully configure Salesforce Marketing Cloud as a destination, you need to configure the following settings:\n\n*   **Client ID**: Enter the client ID associated with your SFMC package.\n*   **Client Secret**: Enter the client secret for the package.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> To retrieve the client ID and secret associated with your SFMC package, go to your [SFMC dashboard](https://mc.exacttarget.com/cloud/), click your name on the top right followed by **Setup** > **Apps** > **Installed Packages**, and select your installed package. The Client ID and Client Secret are listed under the **API Integration** section.\n\n*   **Subdomain**: Enter the subdomain associated with your SFMC account. The subdomain is a 28-character string starting with the letters `mc`. For example, if your **Authentication Base URI** is `https://mcxt4zx444ppr71jd9rp300hdc8y.auth.marketingcloudapis.com/`, then the subdomain is `mcxt4zx444ppr71jd9rp300hdc8y`.\n\n#### Identify call settings\n\n*   **Do not create or update contacts**: Enable this setting to disable creating or updating contacts in SFMC via an [`identify`](#identify) call.\n*   **Identify data external key**: Enter the external key of the SFMC data extension to which to you want to send data from the `identify` events. You can find the external key for your data extension in the SFMC dashboard by going to **Contact Builder** > **Data Extensions**.\n\n#### Track call settings\n\n*   **Map events to external key**: Use this setting to map your `track` events to an SFMC data extension. For more information on this setting, see [Map events to external key](#mapping-events-to-external-key).\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> If you do not map an event to an external key and send the event to SFMC, you will receive an `\"Event not mapped for this track call\"` error.\n\n*   **Map events to Primary Key**: Use this setting to map your own primary key for a `track` event. For more information on this setting, see [Map events to primary key](#mapping-events-to-primary-key).\n*   **Map events to event definition key**: Use this setting to map your RudderStack event to a specific SFMC event definition key. For more information on this setting, see [Map events to primary key](#map-events-to-event-definition-key).\n*   **Event Name to UUID**: Use this setting to assign a UUID as the primary key for a specified event. For more information on this setting, see [Set UUID as primary key](#setting-uuid-as-primary-key).\n*   **OneTrust cookie categories**: Use this setting to associate [OneTrust](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/data-governance/consent-management/onetrust/) cookie consent groups to SFMC.\n\n## Identify\n\nYou can use the [`identify`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/identify/) event to create or update contacts in Salesforce Marketing Cloud.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack will not create or update contacts if you enable the **Do not create or update contacts** dashboard setting.\n\nThe following snippet demonstrates a sample `identify` call in RudderStack:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify(\"1hKOmRA4GRlm\", {\n  name: \"Alex Keener\",\n  title: \"CEO\",\n  email: \"alex@example.com\",\n  company: \"Alex's Company\",\n  phone: \"+1-202-555-0146\",\n  state: \"Texas\",\n  city: \"Houston\",\n  postalCode: \"12345\",\n  country: \"USA\",\n  street: \"6649 N Blue Gum Street\",\n  state: \"TX\",\n  createdAt: new Date().toJSON().slice(0, 10).replace(/-/g, \"/\")\n})\n```\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> Note the following:\n> \n> *   You must include the `userId` or `email` trait in every `identify` call. Otherwise, the event will fail.\n> *   Salesforce Marketing Cloud does not permit colons (`:`) in its **Contact Key** field. Hence, you must remove any colons in your `userId` before sending the events.\n> *   Make sure you do not include nested objects in your events as SFMC cannot handle them.\n> *   SFMC accepts dates only in the ISO 8601 format and rejects any other datetime format.\n\n## Track\n\nYou can use the [`track`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/track/) call to capture user events along with the properties associated with them.\n\nA sample `track` call is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"Product Purchased\", {\n  product_id: \"ASIN3556\",\n  currency: \"USD\",\n  revenue: 77\n})\n```\n\n### Map events to external key\n\nRudderStack lets you send specific `track` events to your SFMC data extension to send events or push notifications using the **Map events to external key** dashboard setting. Enter the `track` event name and the external key for the corresponding SFMC data extension where you want to send the data. You can add mappings for multiple `track` events by clicking the **Add More** button.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> You can find the external key for your data extension in the SFMC dashboard by going to **Contact Builder** > **Data Extensions**.\n\n[![](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/sfmc-track-settings-1.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/sfmc-track-settings-1.webp)\n\n### Map events to primary key\n\nA primary key is required for all `track` events going to an SFMC data extension. Use the **Map events to primary key** dashboard setting to map a `track` event to your own primary key. You can add multiple primary keys by comma separating them.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> Note that:\n> \n> *   The primary key specified in the dashboard setting must match the primary key set in your SFMC data extension.\n> *   If you do not specify a primary key for a `track` event, RudderStack creates a primary key called `Contact Key` by default and maps it to the event’s `userId`. If `userId` is absent, RudderStack maps it to `email` instead.\n> *   The key specified in the dashboard settings should be present in your event properties.\n\n### Map events to event definition key\n\nUse the **Map events to event definition key** dashboard setting to map a `track` event to a specific event defintion key. RudderStack uses this setting to send the interaction events to SFMC by leveraging their [`/events`](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/marketing/marketing-cloud/references/mc_rest_interaction/postEvent.html) endpoint.\n\nYou can find the event definition key in **Event Administration** section after you create and save the event in your SFMC dashboard.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Make sure to include `id` and `email` in your `track` properties as these are mandatory Salesforce fields for the feature to work correctly.\n\n### Set UUID as primary key\n\nRudderStack lets you set an automatically-generated UUID as the primary key value for a `track` event. To do so, enter the event in the **Event Name** field under **Track Call Settings** and enable the **UUID** setting.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> To add multiple events, click the **Add more** button and enable the corresponding **UUID** toggle.\n\nRudderStack automatically generates a UUID and passes it to SFMC as the value for a primary key called `Uuid` for those events.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> You must set `Uuid` as a primary key in your data extension before using this feature.\n\n[![](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/sfmc-track-settings-2.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/sfmc-track-settings-2.webp)\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> The UUID will override the primary key defined for the event in the **Map events to primary key** setting.\n\n## Contextual field mappings\n\nRudderStack automatically collects the [contextual properties](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/common-fields/#contextual-fields) and passes them to SFMC as data extension attributes. To use these fields, you must set the attributes in the SFMC data extensions with specific naming conventions.\n\nThe below table lists the mappings between the RudderStack contextual fields and the SFMC data extension attributes:\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack automatically formats the attributes/properties in camel case or snake case to title case.\n\n| RudderStack contextual fields | SFMC attribute name |\n| --- | --- |\n| `app.name` | `App Name` |\n| `app.version` | `App Version` |\n| `app.build` | `App Build` |\n| `campaign.name` | `UTM Campaign` |\n| `campaign.source` | `UTM Source` |\n| `campaign.medium` | `UTM Medium` |\n| `campaign.term` | `UTM Term` |\n| `campaign.content` | `UTM Content` |\n| `locale` | `Locale` |\n| `userAgent` | `User Agent` |\n| `ip` | `IP Address` |\n| `device.adTrackingEnabled` | `Ad Tracking Enabled` |\n| `device.manufacturer` | `Device Manufacturer` |\n| `device.model` | `Device-model` |\n| `device.name` | `Device Name` |\n| `device.type` | `Device Type` |\n| `network.bluetooth` | `Bluetooth Enabled` |\n| `network.carrier` | `Network Carrier` |\n| `network.cellular` | `Cellular Enabled` |\n| `network.wifi` | `Wifi Enabled` |\n| `screen.density` | `Screen Density` |\n| `screen.height` | `Screen Height` |\n| `screen.width` | `Screen Width` |\n\nQuestions?

It offers a suite of enterprise applications revolving around marketing automation, customer engagement and support, application development as well as analytics.\n\nRudderStack lets you identify your leads in Salesforce without having to use the REST APIs.\n\nFind the open source transformer code for this destination in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-transformer/tree/master/src/v0/destinations/salesforce).\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> Before you get started, note the following:\n> \n> *   RudderStack does not support dev instances of Salesforce. See [FAQ](#does-rudderstack-support-dev-instances-of-salesforce) for more information.\n> *   Creating a new Salesforce account to use with RudderStack is recommended to protect any confidential information in your existing Salesforce account. However, this is completely **optional**.\n> *   To give RudderStack the required API permissions, create a new user account in your Salesforce dashboard by going to **Setup** > **Administration Setup** > **Users** > **New User** and select **System Administrator** as the profile type.\n> *   For the above user, make sure the password policy is set to **Never expires** to avoid event delivery issues due to password expiration. See [Salesforce documentation](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.users_profiles_password_policies.htm&type=5) for more information on setting the password policy.\n> *   Make sure to **turn off** two-factor authentication for your Salesforce account. RudderStack will be unable to authenticate while making requests if 2FA is enabled.\n> *   Make sure the Salesforce objects are searchable and fields are creatable before sending events. Otherwise, it can result in errors during event transformation or delivery.\n\n## Getting started\n\nBefore configuring Salesforce as a destination in RudderStack, verify if the source platform is supported by referring to the table below:\n\n| **Connection Mode** | **Web** | **Mobile** | **Server** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Device mode** | \\-  | \\-  | \\-  |\n| **Cloud** **mode** | **Supported** | **Supported** | **Supported** |\n\nOnce you have confirmed that the source platform supports sending events to Salesforce, follow these steps:\n\n1.  From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add the source. Then, from the list of destinations, select **Salesforce**.\n2.  Assign a name to your destination and click **Next**.\n\n### Connection settings\n\nTo configure Salesforce as a destination in RudderStack, specify the following settings:\n\n*   **User Name**: Enter your Salesforce username in this field.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> **The Salesforce API does not support certain special characters in the username.**\n> \n> For example, if you create a secondary user with the email `alex.keener+rudder@domain.com`, Salesforce sets the username to that email address by default. However, to work with the Salesforce API you will need to remove the `+` sign from the username.\n\n*   **Password**: Enter the password associated with the Salesforce account.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> OAuth 2.0 username-password flow is blocked by default in new orgs to avoid any security risks.\n> \n> Make sure to toggle on the **Allow OAuth Username-Password Flows** setting to enable this flow for your org. For more information, see the [Salesforce documentation](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=release-notes.rn_security_username-password_flow_blocked_by_default.htm&release=244&type=5).\n> \n> ![Salesforce OAuth flow setting](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/salesforce-oauth-flow.webp)\n\n*   **Security Token**: Enter your [Salesforce security token](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.user_security_token.htm&language=en_US&r=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&type=5).\n*   **Map Rudder Properties to Salesforce Properties**: This setting is enabled by default and allows you to map the RudderStack event properties to the corresponding Salesforce fields.\n*   **Sandbox mode**: Enable this setting if you are using a [Sandbox environment](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=sf.deploy_sandboxes_parent.htm&type=5) for the integration.\n*   **Use contact ID for converted leads**: Enable this setting if both the lead and contact field mappings are the same.\n\n## Identify\n\nYou can use the [`identify`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/identify/) call to create or update leads in Salesforce.\n\nThe following code snippet demonstrates a sample `identify` call:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify('1hKOmRA4GRlm', {\n  name: 'Alex Keener',\n  title: 'Mr.',\n  email: 'alex@example.com',\n  company: 'Google Inc.',\n  phone: '+1-202-555-0146',\n  rating: 'Hot',\n  city: 'New Orleans',\n  postalCode: '90002',\n  country: 'US',\n  street: 'Blue Gum Street',\n  state: 'LA'\n});\n```\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> You don’t require a `userId` to create a lead in Salesforce.\n\nWhen you call `identify`, RudderStack checks if the lead already exists using the `email` property. If yes, the lead/contact is updated with the traits passed in the `identify` call. If not, a new lead is created in Salesforce.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> When you make an `identify` call with a set of user traits, RudderStack updates the appropriate record in Salesforce depending on whether it is a lead or a contact using its lead or contact ID.\n\n### Updating custom fields in Salesforce\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> To update custom fields in Salesforce using RudderStack, make sure that you first create those fields in Salesforce before sending the data through RudderStack. For more information, see [Salesforce Help](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=sf.adding_fields.htm&type=5) guide.\n\nAs the [Salesforce Leads API](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api.meta/api/sforce_api_objects_lead.htm) requires`lastName` and `company` to be present, absence of either of these fields will result in RudderStack automatically appending the `'n/a'` to both the fields - even if they have been specified in some previous request.\n\nFor example, if you want to collect a custom trait in RudderStack named `newProp`, create a field label named `newProp`. This will generate an API name as `newProp__c`. RudderStack automatically appends the `__c` to any custom trait.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> **Make sure the casing is consistent**.\n> \n> For example, if the custom fields are created in the camel case, then the traits must be sent to RudderStack in the camel case only.\n\n## Updating Salesforce objects\n\nYou can create or update any [Salesforce object](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.object_reference.meta/object_reference/sforce_api_objects_list.htm) using the `identify` event. To specify the object type, follow the below schema.\n\nRudderStack looks for the key `externalId` under `context` and determines the Salesforce object type by removing the part `Salesforce-` from the field `type`. Further, it makes a `PATCH` request if there is an `id` present in the request to update the record. Otherwise, a new record is created.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> You cannot send an `id` property when creating new records as it will cause an API failure.\n> \n> When creating new records, only provide the `type: \"Salesforce-Contact\"` portion of the `externalId` object.\n\nYou can pass multiple object types in a single request and RudderStack will create that many requests to Salesforce.\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify('123456',\n    {\n      FirstName: \"John\",\n      LastName: \"Gibbs\",\n      Email: \"john@peterson.com\"\n    },\n    {\n      externalId: [\n        {\n          type: \"Salesforce-Contact\",\n          id: \"sf-contact-id\"\n        }\n      ]\n    });\n```\n\nIn the example above, RudderStack updates the `Contact` object in Salesforce with `id` as `sf-contact-id` and sends the `traits` object to Salesforce.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> By default, RudderStack creates a `Lead` object in Salesforce and maps the `traits` to it, as mentioned above. For other objects, RudderStack does not modify the `traits`; they are sent to Salesforce as it is.\n\n## Supported mappings\n\nRudderStack supports and maps the event properties to several standard fields in Salesforce, as listed in the following table:\n\n| RudderStack property | Salesforce field |\n| --- | --- |\n| `address.accuracy` / `accuracy` | `Accuracy` |\n| `company.annualRevenue` | `AnnualRevenue` |\n| `address.city` / `city` | `City` |\n| `company.name` / `company` | `Company` |\n| `address.country` / `country` | `Country` |\n| `address.countryCode` / `countryCode` | `CountryCode` |\n| `convertedAccountId` | `ConvertedAccountId` |\n| `convertedContactId` | `ConvertedContactId` |\n| `convertedDate` | `ConvertedDate` |\n| `convertedOpportunityId` | `ConvertedOpportunityId` |\n| `createdById` | `CreatedById` |\n| `createdAt` / `createddate` | `CreatedDate` |\n| `description` | `Description` |\n| `email` | `Email` |\n| `emailBouncedDate` | `EmailBouncedDate` |\n| `emailBouncedReason` | `EmailBouncedReason` |\n| `firstName` | `FirstName` |\n| `geocodeAccuracy` | `GeocodeAccuracy` |\n| `id` | `Id` |\n| `company.industry` | `Industry` |\n| `individualId` | `IndividualId` |\n| `isConverted` | `IsConverted` |\n| `isDeleted` | `IsDeleted` |\n| `isUnreadByOwner` | `IsUnreadByOwner` |\n| `jigsaw` | `Jigsaw` |\n| `jigsawContactId` | `JigsawContactId` |\n| `lastActivityDate` | `LastActivityDate` |\n| `lastModifiedById` | `LastModifiedById` |\n| `lastModifiedDate` | `LastModifiedDate` |\n| `lastName` | `LastName` |\n| `lastReferencedDate` | `LastReferencedDate` |\n| `lastViewedDate` | `LastViewedDate` |\n| `address.latitude` / `latitude` | `Latitude` |\n| `LeadSource` | `LeadSource` |\n| `address.longitude` / `longitude` | `Longitude` |\n| `masterRecordId` | `MasterRecordId` |\n| `name` | `Name` |\n| `company.employee_count` | `NumberOfEmployees` |\n| `ownerId` | `OwnerId` |\n| `phone` | `Phone` |\n| `photoUrl` | `PhotoUrl` |\n| `address.postalCode` / `postalCode` | `PostalCode` |\n| `rating` | `Rating` |\n| `salutation` | `Salutation` |\n| `address.state` / `state` | `State` |\n| `address.stateCode` / `stateCode` | `StateCode` |\n| `status` | `Status` |\n| `address.street` / `street` | `Street` |\n| `systemModstamp` | `SystemModstamp` |\n| `title` | `Title` |\n| `website` | `Website` |\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### Which Salesforce Edition should I use to access the API?\n\nBefore connecting to the Salesforce API with RudderStack, make sure you are using the right Salesforce edition. You must have either the **Enterprise**, **Unlimited**, **Developer**, or **Performance** editions to access the API.\n\nFollow this [Salesforce help article](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=000326486&type=1&mode=1) for more information.\n\n#### Where do I obtain the Security Token?\n\nYou can find your security token under **Setup** > **Personal Setup** > **My Personal Information** > [Reset My Security Token](https://na15.salesforce.com/_ui/system/security/ResetApiTokenEdit).\n\n#### How do I check the number of Salesforce API calls left for the day?\n\nTo check the number of Salesforce API calls, go to **Setup** > **Administration Setup** > **Company Profile** > **Company Information**. You should then be able to see a field called **API Requests, Last 24 Hours**, which contains the number of API calls left for the day.\n\n#### Does RudderStack support dev instances of Salesforce?\n\nNo, RudderStack does not support Salesforce dev instances currently.\n\nNote that the dev environments (for example, `https://companyabc-dev-ed-develop.lightning.force.com/`) are different from Salesforce’s [sandbox environments](#connection-settings).\n\n#### How to fix “No such column ‘X’ on sobject of type Y” errors?\n\nIf event delivery to Salesforce fails due to a provided field not existing - even though the field does exist - check the field-level security settings for that field in Salesforce.\n\nWhen the field is **not** marked as visible to the role your RudderStack Salesforce user is using, you will get this error. To fix it, make the field visible to the appropriate role.\n\nQuestions? Contact us by [email](mailto:docs@rudderstack.com) or on [Slack](https://rudderstack.com/join-rudderstack-slack-community)",

Once the destination is configured and enabled, events from RudderStack will start flowing to Segment.\n\nBefore configuring Segment in RudderStack, verify if the source platform supports sending events to RudderStack by referring to the table below:\n\n| **Connection Mode** | **Web** | **Mobile** | **Server** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Device Mode** | **\\-** | **\\-** | **\\-** |\n| **Cloud Mode** | **Supported** | **Supported** | **Supported** |\n\nThen, perform the steps below:\n\n*   Configure the data source in RudderStack.\n*   From the list of destinations, select **Segment**.\n\n[![](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/2%20%2827%29.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/2%20%2827%29.webp)\n\n*   Then, assign a name to the destination and click **Next**.\n\n[![](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/3%20%2824%29.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/3%20%2824%29.webp)\n\n*   Select the data source and click **Next**.\n\n[![](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/4%20%2823%29.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/4%20%2823%29.webp)\n\n*   Enter the Segment write key to configure the destination:\n\n[![](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/5%20%2822%29.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/5%20%2822%29.webp)\n\n*   To transform your event data before sending it to this destination, click **Create New Transformation**. Otherwise, click **Next**.\n\n[![](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/6%20%2820%29.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/6%20%2820%29.webp)\n\n*   Your Segment destination is now configured and enabled.\n\n[![](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/7%20%2815%29.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/7%20%2815%29.webp)\n\n## Identify\n\nThe `identify` call lets you associate a visiting user to their actions as well as record their traits.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> As a best practice, please make sure that the `identify`call is made at the start of every session or page load for logged-in users, if possible. This will ensure all latest traits are captured.\n\nA sample `identify` call is as shown:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify(\"userid\", {\n  name: \"Name Surname\",\n  email: \"name@website.com\",\n  phone: \"phone\",\n  birthday: \"birthday\",\n  gender: \"M\",\n  avatar: \"link to image\",\n  title: \"Owner\",\n})\n```\n\n## Track\n\nThe `track` call allows you to record the customer events, i.e. the actions that they perform, along with their associated properties.\n\nA sample `track` call is as shown:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"Event Name\", {\n  Plan: \"plan value\",\n})\n```\n\n## Page\n\nThe `page` call lets you record your website’s page views, with any additional relevant information about the viewed page.\n\nA sample `page` call is as shown:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.page(\"Cart\", \"Cart Viewed\", {\n  path: \"/cart\",\n  referrer: \"test.com\",\n  search: \"term\",\n  title: \"test_item\",\n  url: \"http://test.in\",\n})\n```\n\n## Group\n\nThe `group` call lets you associate a particular identified user with a group, such as a company, organization, or an account. It also lets you record the custom traits associated with that group, such as the name of the group, number of employees, etc.\n\nA sample `group` call is as shown:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.group(\"sample-group-id\", {\n  name: \"Example Company\",\n  employees: 1000,\n  industry: \"Software\",\n});\n```\n\n## Alias\n\nThe alias call allows you to associate one user identity with another. This is quite useful in case of some destinations such as Mixpanel (associating `anonymousId` with an identified user on signup) or Kissmetrics (when the user switches IDs).\n\nA sample `alias` call is as shown:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.alias(\"to\", \"from\", options, callback)\n```\n\nThe above `alias` call has the following parameters:\n\n| **Parameter** | **Presence** | **Description** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **`to`** | Required | Denotes the new identifier |\n| **`from`** | Optional | Denotes the old identifier which will be an alias for the `to` parameter. If not provided, the SDK will populate this as the currently identified `userId`, or `anonymousId` in case of anonymous users. |\n| **`options`** | Optional | This dictionary provides additional context to the event payload. |\n| **`callback`** | Optional | This function gets executed after successful execution of the **`alias()`** method. |\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### How do I get the Segment Write Key?\n\nTo get the Segment Write Key, you can create a HTTP source in your Segment dashboard.\n\nOnce you create the source, you can copy the **Write Key** for that source and use it in RudderStack for sending the data.\n\nQuestions?

    "markdown": "# SendGrid destination | RudderStack Docs\n\nSend your event data from RudderStack to SendGrid.\n\n* * *\n\n*     10 minute read  \n    \n\n[SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/) is a cloud-based email marketing platform built for marketers and developers. It helps businesses deliver billions of transactional and marketing emails every month.\n\n## Getting started\n\nRudderStack supports sending event data to SendGrid via the following [connection modes](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/):\n\n| Connection Mode | Web | Mobile | Server |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Device mode** | \\-  | \\-  | \\-  |\n| **Cloud mode** | **Supported** | **Supported** | **Supported** |\n\nOnce you have confirmed that the source platform supports sending events to SendGrid, follow these steps:\n\n1.  From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add the source. Then, from the list of destinations, select **SendGrid**.\n2.  Assign a name to your destination and click **Continue**.\n\n## Connection settings\n\nTo successfully configure SendGrid as a destination, you will need to configure the following settings:\n\n*   **API Key**: Enter your SendGrid API Key. Refer to the [SendGrid documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/account-and-settings/api-keys) for more information on obtaining the API Key.\n*   **Email Subject**: Enter the subject of the email. You can also send it via the `subject` field in the `track` call’s properties. For more information, refer to the [Track](#track) section below.\n*   **Template ID**: Enter the **Template ID** present in your [SendGrid dashboard](https://app.sendgrid.com/) > **Email API** > **Dynamic Templates**. You can also set the Template ID via the `templateId` field in the `track` call’s properties.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> `templateId` in the `track` call gets higher priority over the **Template ID** specified in the RudderStack dashboard.\n\n*   **Get email ID from traits**: Enable this setting to let RudderStack search for the user’s `email` inside the user’s `traits`. If found, you can send an event to SendGrid without any `track` call properties.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> This option is only useful when there are no properties in the `track` call. SendGrid requires either the `templateId` or `content` for a successful event delivery.\n\n*   **Reply-To Email**: Enter the email address where the email reply or bounce should be returned.\n*   **Reply-To Name**: Enter the user’s name associated with the above email address.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> You can also send the email ID and name in the `replyTo` field in the `track` call’s properties. Note that these fields will override the **Reply-To Email** and **Reply-To Name** fields set in the RudderStack dashboard.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> For more information on how to send these details via the `replyTo` object, refer to the [replyTo](#replyto) section below.\n\n*   **IP Pool Name**: Enter your SendGrid IP Pool name. For detailed steps on creating an IP pool, refer to the [SendGrid documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/account-and-settings/ip-pools#create-an-ip-pool).\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> The length of the IP Pool name must be between 2 and 64 characters.\n\n*   **SendGrid Contact List Id**: Enter the SendGrid’s contact list ID where you want to create a contact. Refer to the [SendGrid documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/api-reference/lists/get-all-lists) to use their API endpoint to retrieve all your contact lists with their IDs.\n*   **Map your traits to SendGrid custom fields**: Use this setting to map the RudderStack properties with SendGrid’s custom fields.\n\n#### From\n\n*   **Email ID**: Enter the user’s email address through which the email will be sent. For more information on creating a verified sender identity, refer to this [SendGrid documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/sending-email/sender-verification).\n    \n*   **Name**: Enter the name associated with above email ID.\n    \n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> You can also include `email` and `name` inside the `from` object in the `track` call (shown below). Note that this will override the **Email** and **Name** fields specified in the RudderStack dashboard.\n\n```\nfrom:{\n    \"email\": \"test@email.com\",\n    \"name\": \"test\"\n}\n```\n\n#### Event names\n\n*   **Event**: Create the list of events for which RudderStack makes the `track` calls.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack **discards** any `track` call made with an event name that is not specified in this list.\n\n#### Content\n\n*   **Type**: Enter the type of value for the content of your email.\n*   **value**: Enter the actual value to be included in the email.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> You can also send the `content` array via the `track` properties (shown below) which will override the dashboard settings.\n\n```\ncontent: [\n    {\n        \"type\": \"text/plain\",\n        \"value\": \"sample text\"\n    }\n]\n```\n\n#### Attachments\n\nUse the **Attachments** settings to specify any attachments you want to include in your email. The individual settings are as follows:\n\n*   **Content**: This should be a Base64-encoded string.\n*   **Type**: The attachment **type** contains the type of content you are attaching, for example, `\"text/plain\"`, `\"text/html\"`, etc.\n*   **Filename**: Use this setting to specify the attachment’s file name.\n*   **Disposition**: This option specifies how you would like the attachment to be displayed.\n*   **Content ID**: Use this option when **disposition** is set to `inline` and the attachment is an image.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> SendGrid requires that each attachment element must contain **content** and **filename**. The attachments can also be sent via the `track` call (shown below), which will override the dashboard settings.\n\n```\nattachments:[\n    {\n        \"content\": \"base64encodedString\",\n        \"filename\": \"index.html\",\n        \"type\": \"text/html\",\n        \"disposition\": \"attachment\"\n    }\n]\n```\n\n#### ASM\n\nThe **ASM** settings allow you to handle the user’s unsubscribing activity. The configurable options are:\n\n*   **Group ID**: This option specifies the unsubscribe group to associate with this email.\n*   **Groups**: This option contains the array of unsubscribing groups that would be displayed in the unsusbcribing preferences page.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> SendGrid requires that the **Group ID** should always be present if the `asm` object is to be sent.\n\n#### Email settings\n\n*   To include a default footer in every mail, enable the **Footer** option. When enabled, the **text** option contains the plain content of footer. The **HTML** contains the HTML content of footer.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> The footer can also be sent via `track` properties (shown below), which will override the dashboard settings.\n\n```\nmailSettings:{\n    \"footer\": true,\n    \"footerText\": \"plain text\",\n    \"footerHtml\": \"html content\"\n}\n```\n\n*   To send a test mail and ensure everything is correct, you can enable the **Sandbox Mode** setting.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> The sandbox mode can also be enabled or disabled via the `track` properties (shown below), which will override the dashboard setting.\n\n```\nmailSettings:{\n    \"sandboxMode\": true\n}\n```\n\n#### Tracking settings\n\nThe following table describes the various tracking settings to be configured in the RudderStack dashboard:\n\n| **Setting** | **Description** |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Click Tracking** | Allows you to track if a recipient clicked a link in your email. |\n| **Click Tracking enable text** | Indicates if this setting should be included in the text/plain portion of your email. |\n| **Open Tracking** | Allows you to track if the email was opened by including a single pixel image in the body of the content. |\n| **Substitution Tag** | When **Open Tracking** is enabled, this setting allows you to specify a substitution tag that you can insert in the email body at a specific location. |\n| **Subscription Tracking** | Allows you to insert a subscription management link at the bottom of your email’s text and HTML bodies. |\n| **Text** | When **Subscription Tracking** is enabled, this setting refers to the string to be appended to the email with the subscription tracking link. |\n| **HTML** | When **Subscription Tracking** is enabled, this is appended to the email with the subscription tracking link. |\n| **Substitution Tag** | Refers to the tag that will be replaced with the unsubscribe URL. |\n| **GAnalytics** | Allows you to enable Google Analytics tracking. |\n| **utm source** | Refers to the name of the referrer source, e.g. Google. |\n| **utm medium** | Refers to the name of the marketing medium, e.g. Email. |\n| **utm term** | This setting is used to identify any paid keywords. |\n| **utm content** | Allows you to differentiate your campaign from advertisements. |\n| **utm campaign** | Corresponds to the name of the campaign. |\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> The **utm source**, **utm medium**, **utm term**, **utm content**, **utm campaign** options are associated with the **GAnalytics** setting on the dashboard.\n\nFinally, click **Next** to complete the setup. SendGrid will now be enabled as a destination in RudderStack.\n\n## Identify\n\nYou can use the [`identify`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/identify/) call to create a new contact in SendGrid based on their email ID. If the email ID already exists, RudderStack updates the contact details.\n\nRudderStack sends the `identify` events to SendGrid in a batch where the batch limit is 30000.\n\nA sample `identify` call is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify(\"1hKOmRA4el9Z\", {\n  name: \"Alex Keener\",\n  email: \"alex@example.com\"\n}, {\n  \"externalId\": [{\n    \"type\": \"listIds\",\n    \"id\": [\"037ae8d4-25b4-496e-adff-2fded15fd0c5\", \"137ae8d4-25b4-496e-adff-2fded15fd0c3\"]\n  }],\n});\n```\n\nYou can pass the SendGrid `listId` in any of the following ways:\n\n*   In the `externalId` object as shown in the above code snippet (takes the highest precedence)\n*   In the **SendGrid Contact List Id** RudderStack dashboard setting.\n\n### Supported mappings\n\nThe following table lists the property mappings betweeen RudderStack and SendGrid:\n\n| RudderStack property | SendGrid property |\n| --- | --- |\n| `email`  <br>Required | `email` |\n| `city` | `city` |\n| `country` | `country` |\n| `first_name` | `first_name` |\n| `last_name` | `last_name` |\n| `postal_code` | `postal_code` |\n| `state_province_region` | `state` |\n| `address_line_1` | `address` |\n| `phone_number` | `phone_number` |\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> If you send any custom field in the event payload, make sure it is present in SendGrid and mapped in the **Map your traits to SendGrid custom fields** RudderStack dashboard setting.\n\n### Deleting a user\n\nYou can delete a contact in SendGrid using the [Suppression with Delete regulation](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/api/user-suppression-api/#adding-a-suppression-with-delete-regulation) of the RudderStack [User Suppression API](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/api/user-suppression-api/).\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> To delete a user, you must specify their `userId` in the event. Additionally, you can specify a custom identifier (optional) in the event.\n\nA sample regulation request body for deleting a user in SendGrid is shown below:\n\n```\n{\n  \"regulationType\": \"suppress_with_delete\",\n  \"destinationIds\": [\n    \"2FIKkByqn37FhzczP23eZmURciA\"\n  ],\n  \"users\": [{\n      \"userId\": \"eab57ccf-6322-498e-9338-7761c6dc0656\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"userId\": \"47983ca9-7cc6-4942-8ff0-ac443g95658d\"\n    }\n  ],\n}\n```\n\n## Track\n\nThe `track` call lets you send an event to SendGrid along with its properties. **Note that the properties specified in the `track` call will override the settings specified in the RudderStack dashboard.**\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> Note that SendGrid requires either the `templateId` or `content` to be present in the body. Otherwise, the event will be **discarded**.\n\nA sample `track` call is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track('testing',\n      {\n          \"personalizations\": [\n          {\n            \"to\": [\n              {\n                \"email\": \"recipient@email.com\",\n                \"name\": \"Name\"\n              }\n            ],\n            \"cc\": [\n                {\n                    \"email\": \"ccUser@gmail.com\",\n                    \"name\": \"CCUser\"\n                },\n                {\n                    \"email\": \"ccUser2@gmail.com\",\n                    \"name\": \"CCUser2\"\n                }\n            ],\n            \"subject\": \"subject\"\n          }\n        ],\n        \"from\": {\n            \"email\": \"test@email.com\",\n            \"name\": \"Name here\"\n        },\n        \"attachments\":[\n            {\n                \"content\": \"base64encodedString\",\n                \"filename\": \"index.html\",\n                \"type\": \"text/html\",\n                \"disposition\": \"attachment\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"content\":[\n            {\n                \"type\": \"text/html\",\n                \"value\": \"<p>Hello</p>\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"templateId\": \"value\",\n        \"headers\":{\n            \"key\": \"value\"\n        },\n        \"customArgs\":{\n            \"key\": \"value\"\n        },\n        \"categories\": [\"sample\",\"values\",\"here\"],\n        \"sendAt\": 1617260400,\n        \"batchId\": \"some valid batch ID\",\n        \"subject\": \"Subject Value\",\n        \"mailSettings\":{\n          \"bypassBounceManagement\": true,\n          \"bypassSpamManagement\": true,\n          \"bypassUnsubscribeManagement\": true,\n          \"footer\": true,\n          \"footerText\": \"text\",\n          \"footerHtml\": \"html\",\n          \"sandboxMode\": true\n        },\n        \"replyTo\":{\n          \"email\": \"testingreplyto@email.com\",\n          \"name\": \"Name\"\n        },\n        \"replyToList\":[\n            {\n                \"email\": \"test@gmail.com\",\n                \"name\": \"Test\"\n            }\n        ],\n        \"field1\": \"value\"\n  });\n```\n\nThe following sections highlight some important things to keep in mind while using the `track` call to send customer data to SendGrid.\n\n### `categories`\n\nSendGrid allows the `categories` array to have a maximum of 10 values.\n\n### `customArgs`\n\nIf `customArgs` is not provided in the `track` call, the non-default fields are taken as custom fields. In the sample `track` call above, `field1` will be mapped inside `customArgs`.\n\n### Email settings\n\nTo send the event to SendGrid successfully, the following points must be kept in mind:\n\n*   In the `mailSettings`, you cannot combine `bypassListManagement` with `bypassBounceManagement`, `bypassSpamManagement`, and `bypassUnsubscribeManagement`.\n    \n*   If `bypassListManagement` is present, then neither `bypassSpamManagement`, `bypassBounceManagement`, or `bypassUnsubscribeManagement` can be present.\n    \n\n### `personalizations`\n\nSendGrid requires that the `personalizations` array should be present in every event and each object must contain the field `to`.\n\n*   If the **Get email ID from traits** option is enabled in the RudderStack dashboard and the properties are not sent in track call, RudderStack will look for `email` in the event traits. If found, RudderStack will create a `personalizations` object and assign `email` to the `to` field.\n    \n*   In case both **Template ID** and **content** are not assigned in the dashboard settings, the event will **not** be sent as either of `templateId` or `content` is required.\n    \n\n### `replyTo`\n\nNote that SendGrid does not allow only `name` to be sent in the `replyTo` object. `email` must be present too, otherwise the `replyTo` object will be ignored.\n\nA sample `replyTo` object is as shown:\n\n```\nreplyTo:{\n    \"email\": \"test@email.com\",\n    \"name\": \"test\"\n}\n```\n\n### `asm`\n\nIt is mandatory to have the `groupId` field inside the `asm` object.\n\n### Event name\n\nAs mentioned in the [Connection settings](#connection-settings) section above, the event names for which a `track` call is made must be specified in the RudderStack dashboard. In the sample `track` call above, `testing` is the event name that should be configured in the RudderStack dashboard. Otherwise, this event will be discarded.\n\n### `content`\n\nEach object inside `content` array must contain the `type` and `value` fields. If these fields are absent, then the object will be dropped. However, note that the event will **not** be discarded.\n\n### `attachments`\n\nEach object inside attachments array must at least contain the `content` and `filename` fields. If these fields are absent, then the object will be dropped. However the event will **not** be discarded.\n\nQuestions?

You can also use it to trigger a workflow in Sendinblue, for example, adding all identified contacts to a list.\n\nA sample `identify` call is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify(\"1hKOmRA4el9\", {\n  email: \"alex@example.com\",\n  firstName: \"Alex\",\n  lastName: \"Keener\",\n  phone: \"+12025550146\",\n  payment: 2,\n  age: 21,\n  location: \"USA\",\n});\n```\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> The Sendinblue tracker writes the `sib_cuid` cookie on your domain to track the user activity. As a result, you can create only one contact per session in Sendinblue using the `identify` call and update the same contact in that session. To create a new contact, you must clear the `sib_cuid` cookie first or use a different browser.\n\n### Supported mappings\n\nThe following table details the property mappings between RudderStack and Sendinblue:\n\n| RudderStack property | Sendinblue property | Data type |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `context.traits.email`  <br>`context.traits.Email`  <br>`context.traits.E-mail`  <br>Required | `email` | String |\n| `context.traits` | `properties` | Object |\n| `context.traits.firstName`  <br>`context.traits.firstname`  <br>`context.traits.first_name` | `properties.FIRSTNAME` | String |\n| `context.traits.lastName`  <br>`context.traits.lastname`  <br>`context.traits.last_name` | `properties.LASTNAME` | String |\n| `context.traits.phone`  <br>`context.traits.Phone` | `properties.SMS` | String (valid mobile number  <br>with country code) |\n\n## Track\n\nYou can use the [`track`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/track/) call to capture user events along with their associated properties.\n\nA sample `track` call is as shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\n  \"Order Delivered\", {\n    orderId: \"123\",\n    products: [{\n        product_id: 1234,\n        product_name: \"Track Pants\",\n        amount: 1,\n        price: 220,\n      },\n      {\n        product_id: 5768,\n        product_name: \"T-Shirt\",\n        amount: 5,\n        price: 1058,\n      },\n    ],\n  }, {\n    integrations: {\n      All: true,\n      sendinblue: {\n        propertiesIdKey: \"orderId\",\n      },\n    },\n  }\n);\n}\n```\n\n### Supported mappings\n\nThe following table details the property mappings between RudderStack and Sendinblue:\n\n| RudderStack property | Sendinblue property | Data type |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `event`  <br>Required | `event` | String |\n| `context.traits` | `properties` | Object |\n| `context.traits.firstName`  <br>`context.traits.firstname`  <br>`context.traits.first_name` | `properties.FIRSTNAME` | String |\n| `context.traits.lastName`  <br>`context.traits.lastname`  <br>`context.traits.last_name` | `properties.LASTNAME` | String |\n| `context.traits.phone`  <br>`context.traits.Phone` | `properties.SMS` | String |\n| `properties` | `event.data` | Object |\n| Value of `integrations.sendinblue.propertiesIdKey` in `properties`  <br>OR  <br>`messageId` | `event.id` | String |\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> You can also send the user traits to Sendinblue via the `track` call by enabling the **Send user traits in track call** setting in the RudderStack dashboard.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> This section is applicable for the `identify` and `track` calls.\n\nSendinblue provides various [contact attributes](https://help.sendinblue.com/hc/en-us/articles/209499605-What-are-the-different-types-of-contact-attributes-) which you can use to personalize your communication with your contacts. You can find them in the [Contact Attributes](https://my.sendinblue.com/lists/add-attributes) section in the Sendinblue dashboard where `FIRSTNAME`, `LASTNAME`, and `SMS` are the default contact attributes.\n\nYou can also map the traits in RudderStack’s payload to Sendinblue’s contact attributes using the **Map your traits to Sendinblue contact attributes** setting in the RudderStack dashboard.\n\nIf a contact attribute is **not** present in Sendinblue but you send it in the `identify` call’s traits, it can be used only in the [Automation app](https://automation.sendinblue.com/) unless you [add them as contact attributes](https://my.sendinblue.com/lists/add-attributes).\n\nFor example, the following sample code will create (or update) the user `alex@example.com` with firstname `Alex` and lastname `Keener`, and create three properties (`payment`, `age`, and `location`) that can be used only in the Marketing Automation workflows unless you also add them as your contact attributes.\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify(\"1hKOmRA4el9\", {\n  email: \"alex@example.com\",\n  firstName: \"Alex\",\n  lastName: \"Keener\",\n  payment: 2,\n  age: 21,\n  location: \"USA\",\n});\n```\n\n## Page\n\nYou can use the [`page`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/page/) call to send any page-related information to Sendinblue.\n\nA sample `page` call is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.page(\"Home\")\n```\n\n### Supported mappings\n\nThe following table details the property mappings between RudderStack and Sendinblue:\n\n| RudderStack property | Sendinblue property | Data type |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `name` | `page_name` | String |\n| `properties` | `properties` | Object |\n| `properties.url`  <br>`context.page.url` | `ma_url` | String |\n| `properties.path`  <br>`context.page.path` | `ma_path` | String |\n| `properties.title`  <br>`context.page.title` | `ma_title` | String |\n| `properties.referrer`  <br>`context.page.referrer` | `ma_referrer` | String |\n\nQuestions?

It is open source and enables you to monitor and track real-time errors and crashes in your app.\n\nRudderStack supports Sentry as a destination to which you can send your event data directly.\n\n## Getting started\n\nRudderStack supports sending event data to Sentry via the following [connection modes](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/):\n\n| **Connection Mode** | **Web** | **Mobile** | **Server** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Device mode** | **Supported** | \\-  | \\-  |\n| **Cloud mode** | \\-  | \\-  | \\-  |\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> In a web device mode integration, that is, using [JavaScript SDK](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/) as a source, the Sentry native SDK is loaded from `https://browser.sentry-cdn.com/` domain. Based on your website’s content security policy, you might need to [allowlist this domain](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/load-js-sdk/#allowlist-destination-domain) to load the Sentry SDK successfully.\n\nOnce you have confirmed that the source platform supports sending events to Sentry, follow these steps:\n\n*   From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add the source. Then, select **Sentry** from the list of destinations.\n*   Assign a name to the destination and click **Next**. You will then see the following screen:\n\n[![Configuration settings for sentry](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/sentry.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/sentry.webp)\n\nConfiguration Settings for Sentry\n\n### Connection Settings\n\nTo successfully configure Sentry as a destination, configure the following settings:\n\n*   **Public DSN:** Enter the public DSN of your Sentry project here. **This is a mandatory field**.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Refer to the [FAQ](#faq) section below for more information on getting your public DSN.\n\n*   **Environment:** Enter the value you want RudderStack to set as the environment configuration in your Sentry dashboard. For more information on the use of environments in Sentry, refer to their [documentation](https://docs.sentry.io/product/sentry-basics/environments/#creating-environments).\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> If you enter the value for the **Environment** field as a forward slash (`/`), new line character, space ( ), or the string `None`, Sentry will silently discard the environment configuration information without sending any error.\n\n*   **Set Release By Property:** This field helps you dynamically track the application version in Sentry. The property set here will be searched in the global window object. If found, RudderStack will use that particular version. Otherwise, the value set in the **Release** field will be used by default.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Suppose you have set the **Set Release By Property** field to the value `new_custom_version` and RudderStack finds `window.new_custom_version=2.4.5` in the `window` object. In this case, RudderStack will send the value `2.4.5` as the app version to Sentry. Otherwise, it will look for the value input in the **Release** field and send it as the app version.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> Sentry needs the `release` value for every single session. If neither **Set Release By Property** or **Release fields** are specified in the dashboard while configuring the destination, the particular session will be discarded.\n\n*   **Release:** This field is used for tracking your application’s version in Sentry.\n*   **Server Name:** This option is used to track the host on which the client is running. You can enter the server name or even the Device ID in this field.\n*   **Logger:** The name you want Sentry to use as logger. For more information on Sentry’s logging feature, refer to their [docs](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/guides/logging/).\n*   **Ignore Errors:** This option refers to a list of error messages that you do not want Sentry to notify you. You can enter this list as a string or a regular expression.\n*   **Include Paths:** This field should contain the regex patterns of URLs that are part of the app in the stack trace. The other frames will appear as collapsed in the Sentry dashboard.\n*   **Allow URLs:** This is the list of the regex patterns or exact URL strings - from which the errors need to be exclusively sent to Sentry. The URLs of the actual JavaScript files should match this list.\n*   **Deny URLs:** This field refers to the list of regex patterns or exact URL strings for which the errors need to be ignored.\n*   **Debug Mode:** In debug mode, no events are sent to your Sentry instance. You can set this option to **true** or **false** to enable or disable this feature. By default, it is set to **false**.\n\nA sample configuration looks like the following:\n\n[![Configuration](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/sentry.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/sentry.webp)\n\n## Identify\n\nWhen an `identify` call is made, RudderStack calls [`Sentry.setUser`](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/enriching-events/identify-user/) by passing the user traits.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack discards the `identify` call if none of the `userId`, `userName`, `email`, or `ip_address` is present. Atleast one of these four fields is needed to capture the user information. For more information, refer to the [Sentry documentation](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/enriching-events/identify-user/).\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack maps `userId` to `id` while setting the user in Sentry.\n\nA sample `identify` call is as shown:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify(\"userid\", {\n  name: \"Name\",\n  email: \"name@website.com\",\n});\n```\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### How do I get the public DSN of my Sentry Project?\n\nTo get your public DSN, follow these steps:\n\n*   Log into your [Sentry account](https://sentry.io/auth/login/).\n*   In the left navigation bar, go to **Projects** .\n*   Click the right-most settings icon. This will open the settings window.\n*   Click **Client Keys (DSN)** under **SDK Setup**.\n*   Copy the DSN and use it in your RudderStack destination configuration.\n\nQuestions?

    "markdown": "# Serenytics | RudderStack Docs\n\nSend your event data from RudderStack to Serenytics.\n\n* * *\n\n*     4 minute read  \n    \n\n[Serenytics](https://www.serenytics.com/) is a full-featured platform for creating dashboards. Generate charts and track KPIs from multiple sources, and easily share results with management and cross-functional teams.\n\nWith this integration you can use the full range of RudderStack tools to create functions, transform and filter your events on their way to the Serenytics warehouse where you can then visualize your data.\n\n## Getting started\n\nRudderStack supports sending event data to Serenytics via the following [connection modes](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/):\n\n| **Connection Mode** | **Web** | **Mobile** | **Server** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Device mode** | \\-  | \\-  | \\-  |\n| **Cloud mode** | **Supported** | **Supported** | **Supported** |\n\nOnce you have confirmed that the source platform supports sending events to Serenytics, follow these steps:\n\n1.  From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add the source. Then, from the list of destinations, select **Serenytics**.\n2.  Assign a name to your destination and click **Continue**.\n\n## Connection settings\n\nTo configure Serenytics as a destination, first retrieve your data storage URL from the Serenytics dashboard under the **Data** tab.\n\n[![](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/serenytics-data-storage.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/serenytics-data-storage.webp)\n\nThen in the RudderStack dashboard, add the data storage URL to the URL fields in **Connection Settings**.  \n\n[![](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/serenytics-connection-settings.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/serenytics-connection-settings.webp)\n\n## Supported Calls\n\nAll RudderStack events are sent to Serenytics and stored in the Serenytics warehouse. The most common events for each RudderStack method are mapped automatically to the Serenytics naming convention. See the method-specific table below for a reference of the standard mappings.\n\nProperties/fields that are not included in the mapping tables are passed as `trait_{key_name}` in the Serenytics dashboard.\n\nFor example, in this example RudderStack event:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify(\n    \"newUser\",\n    {\n      email: \"user@gmail.com\",\n      phone: \"+919876543210\",\n      subscription: \"youtube\",\n      channelName: [\"b\", \"d\", \"e\", \"f\", \"g\", \"h\", \"i\", \"j\", \"k\"],\n      obj: {\n        first: \"Bob\",\n        last: \"Smith\",\n      },\n    }\n  );\n```\n\nThe `userId` and `email` properties are mapped to `user_id` and `email`, and the remaining traits are mapped as `trait_phone`, etc.:\n\n```\n{\n  user_id: \"newUser\",\n  email: \"user@gmail.com\",\n  trait_phone: \"+919876543210\",\n  trait_subscription: \"youtube\",\n  trait_channelName: [\"b\", \"d\", \"e\", \"f\", \"g\", \"h\", \"i\", \"j\", \"k\"],\n  trait_obj: {\n    first: \"Bob\",\n    last: \"Smith\",\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Identify\n\nThe [`identify`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/identify/) call lets you uniquely identify a user and record any associated traits about them like their name, email, etc.\n\nA sample `identify` call is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify(\"1hKOmRA4el9Zt1WSfVJIVo4GRlm\", {\n  likes_movies: true,\n  favorite_color: \"purple\",\n  age: 13\n});\n```\n\n**Event parameter mapping**:\n\n| RudderStack property | Serenytics property |\n| --- | --- |\n| `messageId` | `id` |\n| `userId` | `user_id` |\n| `context.ip`  <br>`request_ip` | `context.ip`  <br>`request_ip` |\n| `firstName` | `first_name` |\n| `lastName` | `last_name` |\n| `traits.age`  <br>`context.traits.age` | `age` |\n| `email` | `email` |\n| `receivedAt` | `received_at` |\n| `sentAt` | `sent_at` |\n| `originalTimestamp` | `original_timestamp` |\n| `timestamp` | `timestamp` |\n\n### Track\n\nThe [`track`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/track/) call lets you capture user events along with the properties associated with them.\n\n**Event parameter mapping**:\n\n| RudderStack property | Serenytics property |\n| --- | --- |\n| `event`  <br>Required | `event` |\n| `messageId` | `id` |\n| `anonymousId` | `anonymous_id` |\n| `context.ip`  <br>`request_ip` |

`properties.currency` | `currency` |\n| `properties.product_id` | `product_id` |\n| `properties.product_name` | `product_name` |\n\n### Group\n\nThe [`group`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/group/) call lets you link an identified user with a group such as a company, organization, or an account, and record any traits associated with that group, for example, company name, number of employees, etc.\n\nA sample `group` call is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.group(\n  {\n  userId: \"1hKOmRA4el9Zt1WSfVJIVo4GRlm\",\n  likes_movies: true,\n  age: 25,\n  }\n);\n```\n\n**Event parameter mapping**:\n\n| RudderStack property | Serenytics property |\n| --- | --- |\n| `groupId`  <br>Required | `id` |\n| `context.ip`  <br>`request_ip` | `context_ip` |\n| `receivedAt` | `received_at` |\n| `sentAt` | `sent_at` |\n| `originalTimestamp` | `original_timestamp` |\n| `timestamp` | `timestamp` |\n\n### Page\n\nThe [`page`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/page/) call lets you record your website’s page views with any additional relevant information about the viewed page.\n\n**Event parameter mapping**:\n\n| RudderStack property | Destination property |\n| --- | --- |\n| `messageId` | `id` |\n| `anonymousId` | `anonymous_id` |\n| `name`  <br>`properties.name` | `name` |\n| `context.ip`  <br>`request_ip` | `context_ip` |\n| `receivedAt` | `received_at` |\n| `sentAt` | `sent_at` |\n| `originalTimestamp` | `original_timestamp` |\n| `timestamp` | `timestamp` |\n| `properties.category` | `category` |\n| `properties.path` | `path` |\n| `pageUrl` | `url` |\n| `properties.title` | `title` |\n\n### Screen\n\nThe [`screen`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/screen/) call lets you record whenever your user views their mobile screen with any additional relevant information about the screen.\n\n**Event parameter mapping**:\n\n| RudderStack property | Serenytics property |\n| --- | --- |\n| `messageId` | `id` |\n| `anonymousId` | `anonymous_id` |\n| `name`  <br>`properties.name` | `name` |\n| `context.ip`  <br>`request_ip` | `context_ip` |\n| `receivedAt` | `received_at` |\n| `sentAt` | `sent_at` |\n| `originalTimestamp` | `original_timestamp` |\n| `timestamp` | `timestamp` |\n| `properties.category` | `category` |\n| `properties.path` | `path` |\n| `pageUrl` | `url` |\n| `properties.title` | `title` |\n\n### Alias\n\nThe [`alias`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/alias/) call lets you merge different identities of a known user.\n\n**Event parameter mapping**:\n\n| RudderStack property |

It generates real-time alerts to inform teams about incidents and automatically delivers critical information to the right people at the right time.\n\n> ![success](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/tick.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack also supports SIGNL4 as a source. Refer to the [SIGNL4 source](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/cloud-apps/signl4/) documentation for more information.\n\n## Getting started\n\nRudderStack supports sending events to SIGNL4 via the following [connection modes](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/):\n\n| **Connection Mode** | **Web** | **Mobile** | **Server** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Device mode** | \\-  | \\-  | \\-  |\n| **Cloud mode** | **Supported** | **Supported** | **Supported** |\n\nOnce you have confirmed that the source platform supports sending events to SIGNL4, follow these steps:\n\n1.  From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add a source. Then, from the list of destinations, select **SIGNL4**.\n2.  Assign a name to the destination and click **Continue**.\n\n## Connection settings\n\nTo successfully configure SIGNL4 as a destination, you will need to configure the following settings:\n\nThe RudderStack dashboard contains the following fields for each of the above-mentioned settings:\n\n*   **Default Value**: Enter or select the required value for the field.\n*   **RudderStack property name**: Enter the property name whose actual value will be taken from the event payload and assigned to the field.\n\nAlthough these fields are optional, RudderStack prioritizes **RudderStack property name** over **Default Value** if both are specified. For example, consider the following use-case:\n\n*   If you provide `new` in the **Default value** field for the **X-S4-Status** setting, the event payload sent to SIGNL4 will contain `X-S4-Status: new`.\n    \n*   If you set **RudderStack property name** for the **X-S4-Status** setting to `alert_status`, RudderStack looks for the event property `properties.alert_status`. Suppose the value for `properties.alert_status` is set to `resolved`, then the output payload sent to SIGNL4 will contain `X-S4-Status: resolved`.\n    \n*   If you provide values in both the fields, the final output payload sent to SIGNL4 will contain `X-S4-Status: resolved`, as the **RudderStack property name** is given higher priority over **Default Field**.\n    \n*   **X-S4-Filtering**: Enable this setting in the RudderStack dashboard and **Filter events/Signls** setting in the SIGNL4 dashboard to send an alert notification only if the input payload contains any keyword for a category. Refer to the [Signl categories](#signl-categories) section to learn more about keywords and category categories.\n    \n    [![SIGNL4 connection setting](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/signl4-conn-settings-4.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/signl4-conn-settings-4.webp)\n    \n\n*   **Event to title mapping**: This setting lets you map the RudderStack event name to a specific alert title. If you do not provide any value, RudderStack sets the alert title as the event name.\n\n## Signl categories\n\nIn SIGNL4, you can use the categories to mark and tag Signls based on severity, type, or relating to IT systems, machines, sensors, and services. Refer to the [SIGNL4 documentation](https://account.signl4.com/manage/Category) to learn more about the different categories.\n\nYou can use the **X-S4-Service** setting in the RudderStack dashboard to specify the Signl category. If not provided, the keywords present in the payload decide the category of the alert. For example, an event payload containing keywords like `ambulance`, `doctor`, `hospital`, `nurse`, `surgery`, etc., is automatically categorized as **Healthcare**.\n\n[![SIGNL4 connection setting](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/categories-signl4.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/categories-signl4.webp)\n\n## Track\n\nYou can use the [`track`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/track/) call to push alerts for events with a particular alert title, message, or other additional details.\n\nA sample `track` call is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"Security Alert\", {\n  \"status\": \"UP\",\n  \"message\": \"Aggressive passenger\",\n  \"Source\": \"Gate agent\",\n  \"Type\": \"Security\"\n});\n```\n\nYou can pass any key-value pair in the `track` call; RudderStack maps it as is in the SIGNL4 destination.\n\n### Property mapping\n\nThe following table lists the mappings between RudderStack and SIGNL4 properties:\n\n| RudderStack property | SIGNL4 property | Presence | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `event` | `title` | Required | Title of the alert. |\n| `property.message` | `message` | Optional | Text message of the alert. |\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### Where can I find the SIGNL4 API Key?\n\nThe team secret of your SIGNL4 team is the SIGNL4 API key in the RudderStack dashboard.

In your `Podfile`, add the following dependencies:\n\n```\npod 'Singular-SDK', '11.0.4'\npod 'Rudder-Singular', '1.0.0'\n```\n\n  \n\n2.  After adding the dependencies followed by `pod install` command, add the following imports to your `AppDelegate.m` file:\n\n```\n#import <rudder>\n#import <ruddersingularfactory.h>\n```\n\n  \n\n3.  Initialize your `RSClient`:\n\n```\nRSConfigBuilder *configBuilder = [[RSConfigBuilder alloc] init];\n[configBuilder withDataPlaneUrl:<data_plane_url>];\n[configBuilder withFactory:[RudderSingularFactory instance]];\nRSClient *rudderClient = [RSClient getInstance:<write_key> config:[configBuilder build]];\n```\n\n  \n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> This device mode integration is supported for Singular v11.0.4 and above.\n\nFollow these steps to add Singular to your iOS project:\n\n1.  Install `RudderSingular` (available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/)) by adding the following line to your `Podfile`:\n\n```\npod 'RudderSingular', '~> 1.0.0'\n```\n\n  \n\n2.  Run the `pod install` command.\n    \n3.  Import the SDK depending on your preferred platform:\n    \n\n  \n  \n\n4.  Add the imports to your `AppDelegate` file under the `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` method:\n\n```\nlet config: RSConfig = RSConfig(writeKey: WRITE_KEY)\n            .dataPlaneURL(DATA_PLANE_URL)\n\nRSClient.sharedInstance().configure(with: config)\nlet rudderSingularConfig = RudderSingularConfig()\n            .skAdNetworkEnabled(true)\n            .manualSkanConversionManagement(true)\n            .conversionValueUpdatedCallback({ value in\n                print(\"Your SKAN handler \\(value)\")\n            })\n            .waitForTrackingAuthorizationWithTimeoutInterval(0)\nRSClient.sharedInstance().addDestination(RudderSingularDestination(rudderSingularConfig: rudderSingularConfig))\n```\n\n  \n\n```\nRSConfig *config = [[RSConfig alloc] initWithWriteKey:WRITE_KEY];\n[config dataPlaneURL:DATA_PLANE_URL];\n\n[[RSClient sharedInstance] configureWith:config];\nRudderSingularConfig *rudderSingularConfig = [[RudderSingularConfig alloc] init];\n[rudderSingularConfig skAdNetworkEnabled:YES];\n[rudderSingularConfig manualSkanConversionManagement:YES];\n[rudderSingularConfig conversionValueUpdatedCallback:^(NSInteger value) {\n    printf(\"Your SKAN handler %ld\", value);\n}];\n[rudderSingularConfig waitForTrackingAuthorizationWithTimeoutInterval:0];\n[[RSClient sharedInstance] addDestination:[[RudderSingularDestination alloc] initWithRudderSingularConfig:rudderSingularConfig]];\n```\n\nTo add Singular to your Android app, follow these steps:\n\n1.Open your `app/build.gradle` (Module: `app`) file, and add the following under the `dependencies` section :\n\n```\nimplementation 'com.rudderstack.android.sdk:core:[1.0,2.0)'\nimplementation 'com.rudderstack.android.integration:singular:1.0.0'\nimplementation 'com.google.code.gson:gson:2.8.6'\n```\n\n  \n\n2.  Add the Singular Maven plugin to your build script. To do this, add the following snippet into the `Gradle Scripts` section of your root `build.gradle`:\n\n```\nbuildscript {\n    repositories {\n        google()\n        mavenCentral()\n        maven {\n          url 'https://maven.singular.net/'\n        }\n    }\n    dependencies {\n        classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:7.1.2'\n        classpath 'org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-gradle-plugin:1.6.10'\n    }\n}\nallprojects {\n    repositories {\n        google()\n        mavenCentral()\n        maven {\n          url 'https://maven.singular.net/'\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n  \n\n3.  Add the following permissions(if not present already) to your `AndroidManifest.xml`:\n\n```\n<uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.INTERNET\"></uses-permission>\n<uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE\"></uses-permission>\n```\n\n  \n\n4.  Finally, initialize the RudderStack SDK in your `Application` class’ `onCreate()` method:\n\n```\n// initialize Rudder SDK\nval rudderClient =\n    RudderClient.getInstance(\n        this,\n        WRITE_KEY,\n        RudderConfig.Builder()\n            .withDataPlaneUrl(DATA_PLANE_URL)\n            .withFactory(SingularIntegrationFactory.FACTORY)\n            .build()\n    )\n```\n\n  \n\nTo add Singular to your React Native app, follow these steps:\n\n1.  Add the RudderStack-Singular module to your app by running the following command:\n\n```\nnpm install @rudderstack/rudder-integration-singular-react-native\n// OR //\nyarn add @rudderstack/rudder-integration-singular-react-native\n```\n\n  \n\n2.  Open your project-level `android/build.gradle` file and add the following snippet:\n\n```\nrepositories {\n  maven {\n    url \"https://maven.singular.net/\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n  \n\n3.  Import the above module and add it to your SDK initialization:\n\n```\nimport rudderClient from \"@rudderstack/rudder-sdk-react-native\"\nimport singular from \"@rudderstack/rudder-integration-singular-react-native\"\nconst config = {\n\tdataPlaneUrl: <data_plane_url>,\n\ttrackAppLifecycleEvents: true,\n\twithFactories: [singular],\n}\nrudderClient.setup(<write_key>, config)\n```\n\n  \n\nTo add Singular to your Cordova app, follow these steps:\n\n1.  Navigate to the root folder of your application and run the following command:\n\n```\ncordova plugin add rudder-integration-singular-cordova\n```\n\n  \n\n2.  Add the following code in the `onDeviceReady()` function of your app’s home page to initialize the SDK:\n\n```\nRudderClient.initialize(<write_key>, {\n  dataPlaneUrl: <data_plane_url>,\n  factories: [RudderSingularFactory]\n})\n```\n\nMake sure to use the \\`await\\` keyword with the \\`initialize\\` call.\n\n## Identify\n\nFor device mode integrations, the Singular SDK uses RudderStack’s [`identify`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/identify/) method to map the user ID to their custom user ID. RudderStack uses Singular’s [`setCustomUserId`](https://support.singular.net/hc/en-us/articles/360037581952-Android-SDK-Basic-Integration#Optional_Setting_the_User_ID) API to forward the identified user ID to Singular.\n\nA sample `identify` call for both the Android and iOS SDKs is shown below:\n\n```\n[[RSClient getInstance] identify:@\"1hKOmRA4el9Zt1WSfVJIVo4GRlm\"];\n```\n\n```\nRudderClient.getInstance()?.identify(\"1hKOmRA4el9Zt1WSfVJIVo4GRlm\")\n```\n\n## Track\n\nThe [`track`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/track/) call lets you capture any user actions and the properties associated with them. Each user action is considered to be an event.\n\n### Tracking custom events\n\nA custom `track` call lets you track custom events as they occur in your apps. RudderStack sends these calls to Singular where they are processed as custom post-install events and are made available in the relevant reports.\n\nA sample custom `track` call for both the Android and iOS SDKs is shown below:\n\n```\n[[RSClient getInstance] track:@\"Product Reviewed\" properties:@{\n        @\"product_id\" : @\"345676543\",\n        @\"review_id\" : @\"123454387\"\n    }];\n```\n\n```\nRudderClient.getInstance()\n    ?.track(\n        \"Product Reviewed\",\n        RudderProperty()\n            .putValue(\"product_id\", \"345676543\")\n            .putValue(\"review_id\", \"123454387\")\n    )\n```\n\n### Tracking revenue\n\nSingular supports tracking revenue events. It implements revenue tracking whenever an event containing the `revenue` property is sent(including a zero value). Optionally, you can also pass the `currency` field as an [ISO code](https://www.iso.org/iso-4217-currency-codes.html).\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> The default currency is set to `USD`.\n\nA sample `revenue` track call is shown below:\n\n```\n[[RSClient getInstance] track:@\"Order Completed\" properties:@{\n        @\"revenue\" : @1251,\n        @\"currency\" : @\"INR\"\n    }];\n```\n\n```\nRudderClient.getInstance()\n    ?.track(\n        \"Order Completed\",\n        RudderProperty().putValue(\"revenue\", 1251).putValue(\"currency\", \"INR\")\n    )\n```\n\n## Screen\n\nThe [`screen`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/screen/) method allows you to record whenever a user sees the mobile screen, along with any associated optional properties. This call is similar to the `page` call for the web applications but exclusive to your mobile device.\n\nA sample `screen` call for both the Android and iOS SDKs is shown below:\n\n```\n[[RSClient sharedInstance] screen:@\"Home\" properties:@{\n    @\"category\" : @\"launcher\"\n}];\n```\n\n```\nRudderClient.getInstance()\n    ?.screen(\n        \"Home\",\n        RudderProperty().putValue(\"category\", \"launcher\")\n    )\n```\n\ne above snippet, RudderStack captures all information related to the viewed screen, along with any additional info about the screen.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack sends the `screen` event to Singular as a custom event.\n\n## Reset\n\nThe `reset` method resets the current user’s identity and creates a new anonymous session. It should be called when a user logs out.\n\nRudderStack calls Singular’s [`unsetCustomUserId`](https://support.singular.net/hc/en-us/articles/360037581952-Android-SDK-Basic-Integration#Optional_Setting_the_User_ID) method to reset a user’s identity.\n\nA sample `reset` call for both the Android and iOS SDKs is shown below:\n\n```\n[[RSClient getInstance] reset];\n```\n\n```\nRudderClient.getInstance()?.reset();\n```\n\n## Implementing SKAdNetwork (SKAN) support\n\nAdd the following code before the initialization of the iOS SDK to give the control to Singular for your SKAdNetwork integration:\n\n```\n[RudderSingularIntegration setSKANOptions:YES\n        isManualSkanConversionManagementMode:YES\nwithWaitForTrackingAuthorizationWithTimeoutInterval:@0\n        withConversionValueUpdatedHandler:^(NSInteger conversionValue){\n    // Receive a callback whenever the Conversion Value is updated\n    NSLog(@\"SKAN handler %ld\",conversionValue);\n}];\n```\n\nQuestions?

    "markdown": "# Slack | RudderStack Docs\n\nSend your event data from RudderStack to Slack.\n\n* * *\n\n*     5 minute read  \n    \n\n[Slack](https://slack.com/intl/en-in/) is a popular business communication platform that lets you organize all your business-related chats by specific topics, groups, or direct messaging.\n\nFind the open source transformer code for this destination in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-transformer/tree/master/src/v0/destinations/slack).\n\n## Getting started\n\nRudderStack supports sending event data to Slack via the following [connection modes](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/):\n\n| Connection Mode | Web | Mobile | Server |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Device mode | \\-  | \\-  | \\-  |\n| Cloud mode | Supported | Supported | Supported |\n\nOnce you have confirmed that the source platform supports sending events to Slack, follow these steps:\n\n1.  From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add a source. Then, from the list of destinations, select **Slack**.\n2.  Assign a name to the destination and click **Continue**.\n\n## Connection settings\n\nUse the following settings to send an event to a particular Slack channel:\n\n*   **Type of incoming webhooks**: Select the API from the dropdown that RudderStack uses to send data to the particular Slack channel.\n    \n    *   **Legacy**: RudderStack maps the channel based on the **Event Channel Name** setting. Note that this method may be deprecated soon.\n    *   **Modern**: RudderStack maps the channel based on the **Event Channel Webhook** setting.\n*   **Event Name**: Enter the event name or the regex to match the RudderStack event name.\n    \n*   **Event Channel Webhook**: Enter the webhook URL of the Slack channel where RudderStack sends the above event.\n    \n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> To get the URL for **Event Channel Webhook** setting, make sure you have:\n> \n> 1.  Created a Slack app with **Incoming Webhooks** feature enabled.\n> 2.  Authorized the app to post to your specified Slack channel.\n> \n> See [Sending messages using Incoming Webhooks](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks#getting_started) for more information.\n\n*   **Event Channel Name**: Enter the Slack channel’s name where RudderStack should send the above event using the [legacy method](https://api.slack.com/legacy/custom-integrations/messaging/webhooks). You can specify `#channel_name` or `@user_name`. If not specified, RudderStack sends the events to the Slack channel associated with the incoming webhook URL (**Webhook URL** setting below).\n*   **Regex Matching**: Enable this setting if the event name in the first parameter is a regular expression.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack adds the global `g` parameter implicitly. Hence, you need not add it with the regex.\n\n**Identify Template**: Specify the template used to transform the `identify` event before sending it to Slack. RudderStack uses the following default template:\n\n```\nIdentified {{name}} <traits_key1>:<traits_value1> <traits_key2>:<traits_value2> ....\n```\n\nHere, the traits key and value are the key-value pairs in the `traits` object of the [`identify`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/identify/) event payload.\n\nThe `name` field in the template is determined from either of the following:\n\n*   `traits.name`\n*   `traits.firstName + traits.lastName`\n*   `traits.username`\n*   `properties.email`\n*   `traits.email`\n*   `User userId`\n*   `Anonymous user anonymousId`\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> Only the traits listed in the **Allowlisted Traits** setting are considered to be a part of the identify template. The rest are not sent to Slack.\n\nUse the following settings to transform an event before sending it to Slack:\n\n*   **Event Name**: Enter the event name or the regex to match the RudderStack event name.\n*   **Event Template**: Specify the template used to transform the above event. RudderStack uses the following default template. Note that RudderStack determines `name` similar to the **Identify Template** setting described above.\n\n```\n{{name}} did {{event}}\n```\n\n*   **Regex Matching**: Enable this setting if the event name is a regex in the first parameter.\n*   **Webhook URL:** Enter your Slack’s [incoming webhook URL](https://my.slack.com/services/new/incoming-webhook/). For more information on obtaining this URL, refer to the [FAQ](#faq) section below.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> By default, RudderStack sends all the events to the channel associated with the incoming webhook URL.\n\n*   **Allowlisted Traits**: Specify the user traits to be allowlisted. If not specified, RudderStack sends **all** the user traits to Slack.\n*   **Denylisted Events**: Enter the events to add to your denylist. RudderStack will drop these events.\n*   **OneTrust cookie categories**: Use this setting to associate [OneTrust](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/data-governance/consent-management/onetrust/) cookie consent groups to Slack.\n\n## Handlebar expressions\n\nRudderStack supports [Handlebar expression](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/expressions.html) by leveraging the `handlebars.js` library for including the variables into your dynamic Slack messages.\n\n### Accessible Variables\n\nThe following table lists the variables you can select in your template messages:\n\n| Handlebar expression | Output |\n| --- | --- |\n| `{{name}}` | Identity name of the user in the priority order listed above. |\n| `{{event}}` | Event name, for example, `Product Viewed` or `user login`. |\n| `{{key_1}}`  <br>`{{properties.key_1}}` | The property values from the event’s properties object. |\n| `{{propertiesList}}` | JSON stringified version of your `properties` object. |\n| `{{traits}}` | JSON stringified version of your traits object. |\n| `{{traitsList.key_1}}` | The trait values from the event’s `traits` object. |\n\n### Escaped content\n\nThe values returned by `{{variable}}` are HTML-escaped. For example, if a `variable` has a `&` in its value then it will be returned as `&amp;`. To avoid this behavior, you can use the **triple curly braces** instead of double, like `{{{variable}}}` instead of `{{variable}}`. This will stop the handlebars from escaping a value if there is one, as shown in the following example:\n\n| Expression | Variable | Result |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `{{variable}}` | `\"Marcia & Jan\"` | `\"Marcia &amp; Jan\"` |\n| `{{{variable}}}` | `\"Marcia & Jan\"` | `\"Marcia & Jan\"` |\n\nFor more information on the escaped content, refer to the [Handlebar guide](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/expressions.html#html-escaping).\n\n## Identify\n\nThe [`identify`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/identify/) call lets you identify a visiting user and associate them to their actions. It also lets you record the traits about them like their name, email address, etc.\n\nA sample `identify` call for a template, like `Identified {{name}} with {{traits}}`, is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify(\"1hKOmRA4el9Zt1WSfVJIVo4GRlm\", {\n  name: \"Alex Keener\",\n  email: \"alex@example.com\",\n  country: \"USA\",\n});\n```\n\nFor the above event, you will see the message `Identified Alex Keener with name: Alex Keener email: alex@example.com country: USA` in your configured Slack channel.\n\n## Track\n\nThe [`track`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/track/) call lets you record the user events, that is, the actions your users perform, along with any properties associated with these actions.\n\nA sample `track` call for a template `{{name}} performed {{event}} with {{properties.key1}} {{properties.key2}}` [after the user is identified](#identify) is as follows:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"test_event\", {\n  \"key1\": \"test_val1\",\n  \"key2\": \"test_val2\",\n  \"key3\": \"test_val3\"\n})\n```\n\nFor the above snippet, you will see the message `Alex Keener performed test_event with test_val1 test_val2 test_val3` in your configured Slack channel.\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### How do I obtain the incoming webhook URL?\n\nTo obtain the webhook URL, follow the below steps:\n\n1.  Click your Slack workspace name, then go to **Administration** > **Manage Apps**.\n2.  Search for **Incoming webhooks** in the Slack app directory and add it to Slack by clicking on **Add to Slack**.\n3.  Select a channel where you want to post the messages forwarded by the webhook and click **Add Incoming webhooks integration**.\n\n[![Slack connection settings](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/choose-channel-slack.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/choose-channel-slack.webp)\n\n4.  Finally, copy the webhook URL and enter it in the RudderStack dashboard.\n\n[![Slack connection settings](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/webhook-url-slack.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/webhook-url-slack.webp)\n\n#### Why am I getting Slack messages for all the incoming events in one channel?\n\nBy default, RudderStack sends all the events to the Slack channel associated with the incoming webhook URL (**Webhook URL** setting in the RudderStack dashboard).\n\nTo get specific events in a particular channel, make sure you specify the mappings using the **Event Name** and **Event Channel** settings.\n\nQuestions?

    "markdown": "# Snap Pixel | RudderStack Docs\n\nSend your event data from RudderStack to Snap Pixel.\n\n* * *\n\n*     5 minute read  \n    \n\n[Snap Pixel](https://ads.snapchat.com/) is a piece of JavaScript code that lets you measure the cross-device impact of your advertising campaigns. It enables you to understand how many Snapchat users interact with your website after seeing the ads.\n\n## Getting started\n\nRudderStack supports sending event data to Snap Pixel via the following [connection modes](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/):\n\n| **Connection Mode** | **Web** | **Mobile** | **Server** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Device mode** | **Supported** | \\-  | \\-  |\n| **Cloud mode** | \\-  | \\-  | \\-  |\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> In a web device mode integration, that is, using [JavaScript SDK](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/) as a source, the Snap Pixel native SDK is loaded from `https://sc-static.net/` domain. Based on your website’s content security policy, you might need to [allowlist this domain](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/load-js-sdk/#allowlist-destination-domain) to load the Snap Pixel SDK successfully.\n\nOnce you have confirmed that the source supports sending events to Snap Pixel, follow these steps:\n\n1.  From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add the source. From the list of destinations, select **Snap Pixel**.\n2.  Assign a name to the destination and click **Continue**.\n\n## Connection settings\n\nTo set up Snap Pixel as a destination, you need to configure the following settings:\n\n*   **Pixel ID**: Enter your Snap Pixel ID. Refer to the [FAQ](#faq) section for more information on obtaining your Snap Pixel ID.\n*   **Hashing Method**: Snap Pixel lets you pass a user parameter (`email` or `phone`) in both hashed and non-hashed format during the snippet’s intialization. If you choose **SHA-256**, RudderStack will hash-encode the parameter before passing it to Snap Pixel.\n*   **Mapping to trigger the Snap Pixel events for the respective events set here**: Use this setting to map custom event names to the standard Snap Pixel events.\n*   **Client-side Events Filtering**: This setting lets you specify which events should be blocked or allowed to flow through to Reddit Pixel. Refer to the [Client-side Events Filtering](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/event-filtering/) guide for more information.\n*   **Customize Client Deduplication Key**: Enable this setting to set a custom client deduplication ID in Snap Pixel. Refer to the [Setting custom client deduplication key](#setting-custom-client-deduplication-key) section for more information on this setting.\n*   **Use device mode to send events**: As this is a web device mode-only destination, this setting is enabled by default and cannot be disabled.\n\n## Identify\n\nYou can use the [`identify`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/identify/) call to initialize the Snap Pixel code.\n\nRudderStack checks the cookies for the user parameter (`email` or `phone`) before loading the Snap Pixel snippet. If the parameter is present, RudderStack loads the snippet. Otherwise, it loads the snippet **without passing** the user parameter.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Snapchat strongly recommends passing a user parameter (either `email` or `phone`) through the Snap Pixel, as it lets you get better insights into your tracked conversions and creates more robust Pixel Custom Audiences. For more information, refer to the [Snap Pixel FAQ](https://businesshelp.snapchat.com/s/article/pixel-website-install?language=en_US).\n\nA sample `identify` call is as shown:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify({\n  email: \"alex@example.com\",\n  phone: \"+1-202-555-0146\"\n});   \n```\n\nThe following table lists the user parameters along with the corresponding mapping to the Snap Pixel parameters:\n\n| **RudderStack user parameter** | **Snap Pixel user parameter** |\n| --- | --- |\n| `email` | `user_email` |\n| `phone` | `user_phone_number` |\n\n## Page\n\nWhen you make a [`page`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/page/) call, RudderStack sends the following call to Snap Pixel:\n\n```\nsnaptr(\"track\", \"PAGE_VIEW\")\n```\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> You can make a `page` call with or without the event payload.\n\nA sample `page` call is as shown:\n\n## Track\n\nYou can use the [`track`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/track/) call to send Snap Pixel events. Refer to the [Snapchat documentation](https://businesshelp.snapchat.com/s/article/pixel-website-install?language=en_US) for more information on the Snap Pixel events.\n\nA sample `track` call is as shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track('Order Completed', {\n  'currency': 'USD',\n  'price': 333.33,\n  'order_id': '11111111'\n});\n```\n\nYou can also send the following [RudderStack ecommerce events](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/ecommerce-events-spec/):\n\n| **RudderStack event** | **Snap Pixel event** |\n| --- | --- |\n| `Order Completed` | `PURCHASE` |\n| `Checkout Started` | `START_CHECKOUT` |\n| `Product Added` | `ADD_CART` |\n| `Payment Info Entered` | `ADD_BILLING` |\n| `Promotion Clicked` | `AD_CLICK` |\n| `Promotion Viewed` | `AD_VIEW` |\n| `Product Added To Wishlist` | `ADD_TO_WISHLIST` |\n| `Product Viewed` | `VIEW_CONTENT` |\n| `Product List Viewed` | `VIEW_CONTENT` |\n| `Products Searched` | `SEARCH` |\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack maps `order_id` to Snap Pixel’s `transaction_id` only in case of the `Order Completed` event.\n\nSnap Pixel supports up to 5 custom events, listed below:\n\n*   `CUSTOM_EVENT_1`\n*   `CUSTOM_EVENT_2`\n*   `CUSTOM_EVENT_3`\n*   `CUSTOM_EVENT_4`\n*   `CUSTOM_EVENT_5`\n\n## Setting custom client deduplication key\n\nRudderStack lets you define the client deduplication key for event deduplication. Enable the **Customize Client Deduplication Key** setting in the dashboard to use this feature.\n\nThe following scenarios describe the different ways RudderStack sets the custom deduplication key:\n\n### Scenario 1: Passing the key in the event properties\n\nSuppose you enable the **Customize Client Deduplication Key** setting and set the **Client Deduplication Field** to `properties.dedup`. RudderStack then sets the client deduplication ID with the value associated with `properties.dedup`, as shown in the following snippet:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\n  \"SHARE\", {\n    dedup: \"mydedupid\",\n    checkout_id: \"12345\",\n    product_name: \"Red T-shirt\",\n    product_url: \"http://www.sampledomain.com/products/myred-t-shirt\",\n  }, {\n    integrations: {},\n  }\n);\n```\n\nIn this case, RudderStack sets `mydedupid` as the client deduplication ID.\n\n### Scenario 2: Passing the `messageId` as the deduplication key\n\nSuppose you enable **Customize Client Deduplication Key** and leave the **Client Deduplication Field** empty. In this case, RudderStack sets the event’s `messageId` as the client deduplication ID.\n\n### Scenario 3: Passing wrong/missing field in the dashboard settings\n\nSuppose you enable **Customize Client Deduplication Key** and set the **Client Deduplication Field**, but the field is either missing or has a different name in the event. In this case, RudderStack **does not set** the client deduplication ID.\n\nFor example, if you set **Client Deduplication Field** to `properties.dedup` and the event contains `properties.deduplication` instead, then RudderStack sends the event to Snap Pixel **without setting** the client deduplication ID.\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### Where can I find the Snap Pixel ID?\n\nTo get your Snap Pixel ID, follow these steps:\n\n1.  Go to your [Snap Ads Manager](https://ads.snapchat.com/) account.\n2.  Under **Events Manager**, go to **View Pixel Details** > **Setup Pixel**. You can find the Pixel ID under **Set Up Your Snap Pixel**:\n\n[![Snap Pixel ID](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/snap-pixel-id.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/snap-pixel-id.webp)\n\nQuestions?

If enabled, you need to enter the following:\n    *   **Deduplication key**: Enter the field/property name to be mapped to a standard Snapchat Conversion property `client_dedup_id`, using which Snapchat Conversion deduplicates the events.\n\n## Track\n\nThe [`track`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/track/) event lets you capture user events along with the properties associated with them.\n\nRudderStack tracks and sends the web, mobile, and offline events to Snapchat via the [`conversion`](https://tr.snapchat.com/v2/conversion) endpoint.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack uses Bearer authentication leveraging the Snap API token for authenticating all requests. OAuth is not supported currently.\n\nA sample `track` call is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"Order Completed\", {\n  order_id: \"1234\",\n  currency: \"USD\",\n  products: [{\n      product_id: \"345676543\",\n      price: 7.99\n    },\n  ],\n}, {\n  context: {\n    traits: {\n      email: \"alex@example.com\",\n      phone: \"+1-202-555-0146\"\n\n    }\n  }\n})\n```\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Make sure to pass at least one of the required fields from the below:\n> \n> *   `email`\n> *   `phone`\n> *   `idfa`\n> *   `ip` and `userAgent`\n\nRudderStack checks the `eventConversionType` event property to determine the type of event to send to Snap Conversion (web, mobile, or offline) as specified below:\n\n```\nweb -> \"WEB\",\nmobile -> \"MOBILE_APP\",\nmobile_app -> \"MOBILE_APP\",\noffline -> \"OFFLINE\"\n```\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Make sure you specify the values in the exact format.\n\nIf `eventConversionType` is not found in the event, RudderStack checks if `channel` is present. If `channel` is absent too, RudderStack automatically sets `eventConversionType` to `OFFLINE`.\n\nAn example highlighting the use of `eventConversionType` is shown below:\n\n```\n\nrudderanalytics.track(\"Products Searched\", {\nquery: \"HDMI cable\",\neventConversionType: \"mobile\"\n});\n```\n\nRudderStack tracks the following properties and maps them to the

Use the `externalId` parameter to match the `id` with the TikTok user. Make sure to set the type as `tiktokExternalId`.\n\nSetting an external ID for a user is helpful in increasing match rates across channels and boost your ad measurements and optimization.

It offers chatbots and live chat integrations to drive conversions, reduce response times, and increase customer satisfaction.\n\nRudderStack supports SnapEngage as a destination where you can seamlessly send your event data.\n\n## Getting started\n\nRudderStack supports sending event data to SnapEngage via the following [connection modes](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/):\n\n| Connection Mode | Web | Mobile | Server |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Device mode | Supported | \\-  | \\-  |\n| Cloud mode | \\-  | \\-  | \\-  |\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> In a web device mode integration, that is, using [JavaScript SDK](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/) as a source, the SnapEngage native SDK is loaded from `https://storage.googleapis.com/` domain. Based on your website’s content security policy, you might need to [allowlist this domain](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/load-js-sdk/#allowlist-destination-domain) to load the SnapEngage SDK successfully.\n\nOnce you have confirmed that the source platform supports sending events to SnapEngage, follow these steps:\n\n1.  From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add a source. Then, from the list of destinations, select **SnapEngage**.\n2.  Assign a name to the destination and click **Continue**.\n\n## Connection settings\n\nTo successfully configure SnapEngage as a destination, you will need to configure the following settings:\n\n[![SnapEngage connection settings](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/snapengage-connection-settings-1.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/snapengage-connection-settings-1.webp)\n\n[![SnapEngage connection settings](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/snapengage-connection-settings-2.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/snapengage-connection-settings-2.webp)\n\n*   **Widget ID**: Enter your SnapEngage widget ID.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> For more information on obtaining your SnapEngage widget ID, refer to the [FAQ](#faq) section below.\n\n*   **Record Live Chat Events**: Enable this setting to allow RudderStack to automatically record your SnapEngage Live Chat events as `track` events.\n*   **Update Event Name in track call**: If **Record Live Chat Events** is enabled, enable this setting to update the event names in the `track` call.\n    *   **Mapping to update the Event Name in track call**: Use this setting to map the standard SnapEngage events with your custom event names.\n*   **Client-side Events Filtering**: This setting lets you specify which events should be blocked or allowed to flow through to SnapEngage.\n\n*   **Use device mode to send events**: As this is a [web device mode](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#device-mode)\\-only destination, this setting is enabled by default and cannot be disabled.\n\n## Identify\n\nYou can use the [`identify`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/identify/) call to set the user’s email and username in SnapEngage through their [SDK](https://developer.snapengage.com/javascript-api/#javascript-api).\n\nA sample `identify` call is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify(\n  \"1hKOmRA4GRlm\", {\n    email: \"alex@example.com\",\n    name: \"Alex Keener\"\n  }\n);\n```\n\n### Supported mappings\n\nThe following table lists the mappings between the RudderStack and SnapEngage properties:\n\n| RudderStack property | SnapEngage property | Data type | Presence |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `traits.email` / `context.traits.email` | `email` | String | Required |\n| `traits.name` / `context.traits.name` | `name` | String | Optional |\n\n## Track\n\nIf you enable the **Record Live Chat Events** dashboard setting, RudderStack records the SnapEngage Live Chat events based on the user’s interactions and sends them as [track](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/track/) events. You can then view and analyze these events using other tools (connected to the same source in RudderStack).\n\n### Supported events\n\nRudderStack automatically records and sends the following Live Chat events:\n\n*   [Live Chat Conversation Started](https://developer.snapengage.com/javascript-api/#startchat-event)\n\n```\nSnapEngage.setCallback(\"StartChat\", function() {\n  window.rudderanalytics.track(\n    \"Live Chat Conversation Started\", {}, {\n      context: {\n        integration: {\n          name: 'snapengage',\n          version: '1.0.0'\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  );\n});\n```\n\n*   [Live Chat Conversation Ended](https://developer.snapengage.com/javascript-api/#close-event)\n\n```\nSnapEngage.setCallback(\"Close\", function() {\n  window.rudderanalytics.track(\n    \"Live Chat Conversation Ended\", {}, {\n      context: {\n        integration: {\n          name: 'snapengage',\n          version: '1.0.0'\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  );\n});\n```\n\n*   [Live Chat Message Sent](https://developer.snapengage.com/javascript-api/#chatmessagesent-event)\n\n```\nSnapEngage.setCallback(\"ChatMessageSent\", function() {\n  window.rudderanalytics.track(\n    \"Live Chat Message Sent\", {}, {\n      context: {\n        integration: {\n          name: 'snapengage',\n          version: '1.0.0'\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  );\n});\n```\n\n*   [Live Chat Message Received](https://developer.snapengage.com/javascript-api/#chatmessagereceived-event)\n\n```\nSnapEngage.setCallback(\"ChatMessageReceived\", function(agent) {\n  window.rudderanalytics.track(\n    \"Live Chat Message Received\", {\n      agentUsername: agent\n    }, {\n      context: {\n        integration: {\n          name: 'snapengage',\n          version: '1.0.0'\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  );\n});\n```\n\n*   [Button Clicked](https://developer.snapengage.com/javascript-api/#button-event)\n\n```\nSnapEngage.setCallback(\"InlineButtonClicked\", function() {\n  window.rudderanalytics.track(\n    \"Inline Button Clicked\", {}, {\n      context: {\n        integration: {\n          name: 'snapengage',\n          version: '1.0.0'\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  );\n});\n```\n\n### Mapping events\n\nYou can also update the standard SnapEngage Live Chat events with custom event names. Enable the **Update Event Name in track call** dashboard setting in RudderStack and specify the required mapping:\n\n[![SnapEngage event name mapping](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/snapengage-event-mapping.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/snapengage-event-mapping.webp)\n\nFrom the mappings set in the above image, RudderStack replaces the event names `\"Live Chat Conversation Started\"` and `\"Live Chat Message Sent\"`with `\"User Started Chat\"` and `\"Submit\"` respectively.\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### Where can I find the SnapEngage widget ID?\n\nTo get your SnapEngage widget ID, follow these steps:\n\n1.  Log into your [SnapEngage dashboard](https://www.snapengage.com/app/).\n2.  In the sidebar, select the widget under **Current Widget** for which you want the widget ID.\n3.  Go to **Settings** > **Get the Code**. You will find the widget ID under **(Advanced) Widget ID**:\n\n[![SnapEngage widget ID](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/snapengage-widget-id.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/snapengage-widget-id.webp)\n\nQuestions?

Based on your website’s content security policy, you might need to [allowlist this domain](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/load-js-sdk/#allowlist-destination-domain) to load the TVSquared SDK successfully.\n\nOnce you have confirmed that the platform supports sending events to TVSquared, follow these steps:\n\n1.  From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add a source. Then, from the list of destinations, select **TVSquared**.\n2.  Assign a name to the destination and click **Continue**.\n\n## Connection settings\n\nTo successfully set up TVSquared as a destination, configure the following settings:\n\n*   **Brand Id (Site ID)**: Enter the unique identifier indicating the TVSquared client to which the traffic belongs. It is of the format `TV-XXXXXXX-1` with a variable-length numeric value replacing `X`.\n*   **Client Id (Collector Id)**: Enter the Client ID used to distribute the traffic and manage the load on the TVSquared servers effectively. It is numeric and can contain one or more values.\n*   **Custom Metrics**: The **Property Name** values added in this field are sent to TVSquared for the events containing those event properties, along with the other defined TVSquared properties. For example, if the property added in the dashboard is `shipping` , then the shipping value is sent to TVSquared. A sample snippet for this is shown:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track('Order Completed', {\n  order_id: '5d4c7cb5',\n  revenue: 99.9,\n  shipping: 13.99,\n  tax: 20.99,\n  products: [\n  ]\n});\n```\n\n*   **Client-side Events Filtering**: This setting lets you specify which events should be blocked or allowed to flow through to TVSquared. See [Client-side Events Filtering](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/event-filtering/) for more information.\n\n## Page\n\nWhen you make a [`page`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/page/) call, RudderStack makes a call to TVSquared to record a page view.\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.page('new category',\n'page name',\n{\n  url: 'url',\n  path: '/path'\n});\n```\n\n## Track\n\nCalling the [`track`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/track/) method triggers TVSquared’s `Action Tracker` method.\n\nBy default, TVSquared accepts the following properties in your `track` events:\n\n*   `revenue`\n*   `product type (category)`\n*   `action id (order_id)`\n*   `promo (promotion_id)`\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> All the above parameters are optional. There is no requirement to add these to measure the uplift from TV. However, you can use this data for more detailed analysis as required. If there is no value to pass, RudderStack sets an empty string instead.\n\nA sample `track` call is as shown:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track('Order Completed', {\n  order_id: '5d4c7cb5',\n  category: 'category',\n  revenue: 99.9,\n  shipping: 13.99,\n  tax: 20.99,\n  products: [\n\n  ],\n  promotion_id: 'PROMO_1234'\n});\n```\n\nQuestions?

    "markdown": "# Trengo | RudderStack Docs\n\nSend your event data from RudderStack to Trengo.\n\n* * *\n\n*     5 minute read  \n    \n\n[Trengo](https://trengo.com/en) is a popular business messaging and communications platform that lets you bring together all your messages via email, SMS, social media, etc. into a single central communication hub. It allows you to set up cross-platform collaborations with your team, automate conversations with your users, and deliver personalized customer experiences.\n\nRudderStack allows you to configure Trengo as a destination to which you can send your event data.\n\n## Getting started\n\nBefore configuring your source and destination in RudderStack, please verify if the source platform is supported by Trengo by referring to the table below:\n\n| **Connection Mode** | **Web** | **Mobile** | **Server** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Device mode** | \\-  | \\-  | \\-  |\n| **Cloud** **mode** | **Supported** | **Supported** | **Supported** |\n\nOnce you have confirmed that the platform supports sending events to Trengo, perform the steps below:\n\n*   From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderlabs.com/), add the source. Then, select **Trengo** from the list of destinations.\n*   Assign a name to the destination and click **Next**. You should then see the following screen:\n\n[![](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/trengo-config.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/trengo-config.webp)\n\n### Connection Settings\n\nIn the **Connection Settings**, you will see the following options:\n\n*   **API Token:** This is a unique token generated for your Trengo account. To generate this API token, you need to select **REST API** from **Apps and Integrations** under the **Settings** option in your Trengo account.\n*   **Channel ID:** This corresponds to the unique ID for the channel to which you want to send your data via RudderStack.\n*   **Channel Identifier:** Select this option depending on the type of channel you want to send your data.\n*   **Enable deduplication for Contacts:** By default, RudderStack will _Deduplicate_ contacts generated from your `identify` events. You can disable this option if you want to create duplicate contacts with same identifier.\n*   **Map events with template:** To send `track` events to Trengo, you need to add the `event` to the _Event Name_ field. If you wish to customize the subject for the event, you can do so by adding a _template_.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> For a particular event the **Channel ID** can be overriden using `externalId`, For example: `(context.externalId: [{type:trengoChannelId, id:channelId}])`.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> When using an `externalId` to override _channelId_ , make sure that the **Channel Identifier** of that specific channel matches with the **Channel Identifier** you have selected in RudderStack dashboard.\n\n### Effects on the Identify events\n\nDisabling the option **Enable deduplication for Contacts** will have the following consequences on the `identify` events:\n\n*   RudderStack will not update exising contacts with the same `identifier`.\n*   For the channel identifier **phone**:\n    *   If a contact is present with the same `phone`number as an identifier, it will be duplicated.\n    *   If you want to store multiple contacts for a particular `phone` number as an identifier for different channels (where the `channel identifiers` are **phone** too), you will need to disable the `deduplication` option from RudderStack dashboard.\n*   For the channel identifier **email**:\n    *   If a contact is present with the same `email` address as an identifier, it will not be duplicated. This is a known destination behavior.\n    *   For creating multiple contacts with `email` address as an identifer, you need a unique email address.\n\n## Identify\n\nThe `identify` call lets you associate a user with their actions and capture all relevant traits about them.\n\nFor each `identify` call, RudderStack creates a `contact` using `email` or `phone` as an identifier (depending on the `channel identifier`) using the [Trengo Contact API](https://developers.trengo.com/reference#create-update-a-user).\n\nIf a contact is already present with same `identifier` (`email`/`phone`), RudderStack will update the contact using the [Trengo Contact API](https://developers.trengo.com/reference#update-a-user-1).\n\nA sample `identify` call looks like the following:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify(\"userid\", {\n  firstName: \"Name\",\n  lastName: \"Surname\",\n  email: \"name@website.com\",\n})\n```\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> **NOTE:** If you already have Trengo `contactId` you can pass it in `externalId`, `(example context.externalId: [{type:trengoContactId, id:channelId}])`, in that case will we avoid searching for `contactId` using `identifier(email/phone)` before updating.\n\n## Track\n\nThe `track` call allows you to capture any action that the user might perform along with the properties associated with that action. Each action is considered to be an event. For every `track` event, RudderStack creates a `ticket` in Trengo using the [Trengo Ticket API](https://developers.trengo.com/reference#create-a-ticket).\n\nA sample `track` call looks like the following:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"Product Purchased\", {\n  Clicked_Rush_delivery_Button: true,\n  total_value: 2000,\n  revenue: 2000,\n})\n```\n\n## Mapping Track Events with Trengo’s Event Template\n\nThe following table demonstrates the use of the **Map events with template:** option for your `track` events:\n\n| **Event Name** | **Event Template** | **Subject Generated** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `Product Purchased` | `{{ event }} from our store` | `Product Purchased from our store` |\n| `Added to cart` | `Product was of value:{{ revenue }}` | `Product was of value:2000` |\n| `Checked Out` | `Cart was checked out` | `Cart was checked out` |\n\nA few things to note while using this option:\n\n*   For particular **Event Name**, the **Event Template** is optional. If left blank, the subject will not generated using the Template. (Note: Subjects are generally used for creating tickets in the channels where the channel identifier is `email`.)\n*   For `track` calls, the `contact identifier` is mandatory. For example, for tracking events to an `email` channel, `email` is a mandatory event field. Similarly, for tracking events to a `phone` channel, `phone` is a mandatory event field.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> For lodging your `track` events to Trengo, it is mandatory to add the `event` name in **Event Name** field. If the **Event Name** is not present, the particular `track` events will not flow through.\n\nQuestions?

You can map a RudderStack property only to one User.com property and vice-versa.\n*   **Map Rudder company attributes to User.com company attributes**: Use this setting to map the RudderStack company attributes to specific User.com company attributes.\n\n## User lookup\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> This functionality is applicable only for the `identify`, `track`, and `page` calls.\n\nRudderStack looks up a user in User.com using the `userKey`, `email`, or `phone` properties.\n\n*   You can pass the `userKey` in the `externalId` array:\n\n```\n\"externalId\": [{\n  \"type\": \"userKey\",\n  \"id\": \"uehfuuiuednjk\"\n}],\n```\n\n*   You can pass the `email` or `phone` in the `integrations` object:\n\n```\nintegrations: {\nuser: {\n  lookup: \"email/phone\"\n}\n});\n```\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> You must pass only one of `email` or `phone` in `lookup`. Also, `email` or `phone` (whichever is passed) must have unique values in User.com.\n\nThe precedence order for looking up a user based on the above properties is:\n\n*   The `userKey` is given the highest priority.\n*   The `lookup` value is given the second highest priority. If `phone`/`email` (whichever is passed) is not found, RudderStack will throw an error.\n*   If none of the above is present, RudderStack falls back to the `userId`. If not found, RudderStack will throw an error.\n\n## Identify\n\nYou can use the [`identify`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/identify/) call to create a new user in User.com. If the user already exists, RudderStack updates the user details.\n\nA sample `identify` call is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify('1hKOmRA4el9Zt1WSfVJIVo4GRlm', {\n      firstName: 'Alex',\n      lastName: 'Keener',\n      email: \"alex@example.com\"\n    }, {\n      externalId: [{\n        type: \"userKey\",\n        id: \"Df344sdFgdDsS4\"\n      }],\n      integrations: {\n        user: {\n          lookup: \"email\"\n        }\n      }\n    );\n```\n\n#### Traits mapping\n\nThe following table lists the mappings between RudderStack and User.com properties for `identify` call:\n\n| RudderStack property | User.com property |\n| --- | --- |\n| `userId`  <br>`traits.userId`  <br>`traits.id`  <br>`context.traits.userId`  <br>`context.traits.id`  <br>`anonymousId`

    "markdown": "# Variance | RudderStack Docs\n\nSend your event data from RudderStack to Variance.\n\n* * *\n\n*     4 minute read  \n    \n\nThe [Variance](https://www.variance.com/) customer growth platform makes your product, marketing, and sales data operational. It lets you to create, access, and manage intent-based signals across all stages of your customers’ journey.\n\nRudderStack lets you add Variance as a destination to which you can seamlessly send your event data.\n\n## Getting started\n\nTo enable sending data to Variance, you will first need to add it as a destination in the RudderStack dashboard. Once the destination is configured and enabled, events from RudderStack will start flowing to Variance.\n\nBefore configuring Variance in RudderStack, verify if the source platform supports sending events to RudderStack by referring to the table below:\n\n| **Connection Mode** | **Web** | **Mobile** | **Server** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Device Mode** | **\\-** | **\\-** | **\\-** |\n| **Cloud Mode** | **Supported** | **Supported** | **Supported** |\n\nOnce you have confirmed that the source platform is supported by Variance, perform the steps below:\n\n*   Configure the data source in RudderStack.\n*   From the list of destinations, select **Variance**.\n*   Then, assign a name to the destination and click **Next**.\n*   Select the data source and click **Next**. You will then see the following **Connection Settings** page:\n\n[![](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/image%20%28114%29.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/image%20%28114%29.webp)\n\n*   Enter the Variance **Webhook URL** and **Authorization Header Value** to configure the destination.\n*   To transform your event data before sending it to this destination, click **Create New Transformation**. Otherwise, click **Next**.\n\nThat’s it! Your Variance destination is now configured and enabled.\n\n## Identify\n\nThe [`identify`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/identify/) call lets you associate a visiting user to their actions as well as record their traits.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> As a best practice, make sure that the `identify` call is made at the start of every session or page load for logged-in users, if possible. This will ensure allir latest traits are captured.\n\nA sample `identify` call is as shown:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify(\"userid\", {\n  name: \"Name Surname\",\n  email: \"name@website.com\",\n  company: {\n    id: \"1\",\n    name: \"Website\",\n  },\n})\n```\n\n## Track\n\nThe [`track`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/track/) call allows you to record the customer events, i.e. the actions that they perform, along with their associated properties.\n\nA sample `track` call is as shown:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"Event Name\", {\n  plan: \"plan value\",\n})\n```\n\n## Page\n\nThe [`page`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/page/) call lets you record your website’s page views, with any additional relevant information about the viewed page.\n\nA sample `page` call is as shown:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.page(\"Cart\", \"Cart Viewed\", {\n  path: \"/cart\",\n  referrer: \"test.com\",\n  search: \"term\",\n  title: \"test_item\",\n  url: \"http://test.in\",\n})\n```\n\n## Group\n\nThe [`group`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/group/) call lets you associate a particular identified user with a group, such as a company, organization, or an account. It also lets you record the custom traits associated with that group, such as the name of the group, number of employees, etc.\n\nA sample `group` call is as shown:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.group(\"sample-group-id\", {\n  name: \"Example Company\",\n  employees: 1000,\n  industry: \"Software\",\n})\n```\n\n## Alias\n\nMany destination platforms need an explicit [`alias`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/alias/) call for mapping the already identified users to a new user identifier that you may want to use, to track them in the future. The `alias` call lets you implement this functionality.\n\nA sample `alias` call is as shown:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.alias(\"new_user_id\");\n```\n\n## Account mapping\n\nVariance offers a few different ways of mapping your users to accounts/companies. Here’s an overview:\n\n### Group\n\nIf you already use the `group` call to indicate the Account, then you do not need to fill in anything. Variance will extract the Account automatically, and you’re good to go.\n\n### Identify with custom traits\n\nChoose this option if you include some information about the Account/Company/Organization as a trait in each `identify` call. When you choose this option you’ll need to let Variance know the name of the trait you use.\n\nFor instance, if you pass something like `{'company':{'id':1,'name':'Awesome Inc.'}}` , you could add `company.id` as the **Account ID** trait and `company.name` as the **Account Name** trait.\n\n### Identify email trait domain extraction (fallback)\n\nIf you don’t use either of the methods above, Variance can extract the domain from the `email` trait and use that as the Account name.\n\n## FAQ\n\nHead to the **Integrations** - **RudderStack** page in Variance and then add a RudderStack connection. For more information, check the [Variance docs for RudderStack](https://www.variance.com/docs/rudderstack).\n\nQuestions?

    "markdown": "# Spotify Pixel | RudderStack Docs\n\nSend your event data from RudderStack to Spotify Pixel.\n\n* * *\n\n*     8 minute read  \n    \n\n[Spotify Pixel](https://ads.spotify.com/en-US/ad-analytics/spotify-pixel/) is a powerful ad tracking and analytics tool. It is a piece of JavaScript code that you can integrate in your website and analyze the actions the users take after hearing your ads.\n\n## Setup\n\n1.  In your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), go to **Directory** > **Destinations** > **Cloud Destinations** and search for **Spotify Pixel**.\n2.  Connect your source and click **Continue**.\n\n### Connection settings\n\nConfigure the following settings to set up Spotify Pixel as a destination in RudderStack:\n\n*   **Name**: Assign a name to uniquely identify the destination.\n*   **Pixel ID**: Enter your Spotify Pixel ID. To [obtain this ID](#faq), log in to your Spotify Pixel dashboard and go to **Manage** > **Your Pixels**.\n\n### Connection mode\n\nSpecify how you want to route events from your source to Spotify Pixel.\n\nRudderStack supports sending events to Spotify via the following [connection modes](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/):\n\n| **Connection Mode** | **Web** | **Mobile** | **Server** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Device mode** | **Supported** | \\-  | \\-  |\n| **Cloud mode** | \\-  | \\-  | \\-  |\n\n## Configuration settings\n\nAfter completing the initial setup, configure the following settings to correctly receive your data in Spotify Pixel:\n\n*   **Spotify Pixel Alias Event Setting**: Turn on this setting to enhance attribution by passing a Spotify Pixel [`alias`](https://help.adanalytics.spotify.com/technical-pixel-docs) event along with every conversion event.\n*   **Client-side Events Filtering**: This setting lets you specify which events should be blocked or allowed to flow through to Spotify Pixel. For more information on this setting, see [Client-side Events Filtering](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/event-filtering/).\n*   **OneTrust Cookie Categories**: This setting lets you associate the [OneTrust](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/data-governance/consent-management/onetrust/javascript/) cookie consent groups to Spotify Pixel.\n\n#### **Mappings**\n\n*   **RudderStack to Spotify Pixel Event Mappings**: Use this setting to map your RudderStack events to the standard Spotify Pixel events. You can map multiple Spotify Pixel events to a single RudderStack event and vice versa.\n\n## Track\n\nYou can use the RudderStack [`track`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/track/) event to track user events along with any associated properties and send this information to Spotify Pixel.\n\nRudderStack supports the following standard [Spotify Pixel events](https://help.adanalytics.spotify.com/technical-pixel-docs):\n\n| Spotify Pixel event | Event name | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Lead | `lead` | User completed an action like form submission, free trial signup, button click, etc. |\n| Product | `product` | User viewed a product. |\n| Add to cart | `addtocart` | User added a product to cart. |\n| Check out | `checkout` | User initiated a checkout. |\n| Purchase | `purchase` | User purchased a product. |\n\nYou can map your RudderStack events to the above Spotify Pixel events in the dashboard using the **RudderStack to Spotify Pixel Event Mappings** setting:\n\n[![RudderStack event mapping with Spotify Pixel](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/spotify-pixel-event-mapping.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/spotify-pixel-event-mapping.webp)\n\nIn the above example, RudderStack maps the event `Product Added to Cart` with the Spotify Pixel event `addtocart`.\n\nBy default, RudderStack maps the following events to the Spotify Pixel events:\n\n| RudderStack event | Spotify Pixel event name |\n| --- | --- |\n| `Signed Up` | `lead` |\n| `Product Viewed` | `product` |\n| `Product Added` | `addtocart` |\n| `Checkout Started` | `checkout` |\n| `Order Completed` | `purchase` |\n\nRudderStack prioritizes the custom event mappings you set in the dashboard over the above standard mappings.\n\n### Lead\n\nA sample `track` call mapped to a Spotify Pixel `lead` event is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"Signed Up\", {\n  price: 500,\n  currency: \"USD\",\n  type: \"paper\",\n  category: \"Clothes\",\n});\n```\n\nThe following table lists the mapping between the **optional** RudderStack event properties and the Spotify Pixel attributes:\n\n| RudderStack property | Spotify Pixel property |\n| --- | --- |\n| `properties.price` | `value` |\n| `properties.currency` | `currency` |\n| `properties.type` | `type` |\n| `properties.category` | `category` |\n\n### Product\n\nA sample `track` call mapped to a Spotify Pixel `product` event is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"product\", {\n  price: 1300,\n  currency: \"USD\",\n  product_id: \"1234000\",\n  name: \"goldenTest\",\n  product_type: \"Card\",\n  brand: \"testVendor\",\n});\n```\n\nThe following table lists the mapping between the **optional** RudderStack event properties and the Spotify Pixel attributes:\n\n| RudderStack property | Spotify Pixel property |\n| --- | --- |\n| `properties.price` | `value` |\n| `properties.currency` | `currency` |\n| `properties.product_id` | `product_id` |\n| `properties.name` | `product_name` |\n| `properties.product_type` | `product_type` |\n| `properties.brand` | `product_vendor` |\n\n#### Sending multiple product details\n\nIf you send the product details as an array in the `track` event, RudderStack fetches the details from each product item and calls the Spotify Pixel `product` event for each item. For example, consider the following `track` event:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"Product\", {\n  name: 10.0,\n  currency: \"INR\",\n  quantity: 2,\n  products: [{\n      product_id: \"S1100\",\n      name: \"Product 1\",\n      product_type: \"Card\",\n      brand: \"Some Vendor\",\n    },\n    {\n      product_id: \"S1200\",\n      name: \"Product 2\",\n      product_type: \"Card\",\n      brand: \"Some Vendor 2\",\n    },\n  ],\n});\n```\n\nIn this case, RudderStack makes two `track` calls to Spotify Pixel with the individual product details:\n\n```\n// Call 1\n\nrudderanalytics.track(\"Product\", {\n  price: 10.0,\n  quantity: 2,\n  currency: \"INR\",\n  product_id: \"S1100\",\n  name: \"Product 1\",\n  product_type: \"Card\",\n  brand: \"Some Vendor\",\n});\n\n// Call 2\n\nrudderanalytics.track(\"Product\", {\n  price: 10.0,\n  quantity: 2,\n  currency: \"INR\",\n  product_id: \"S1200\",\n  name: \"Product 2\",\n  product_type: \"Card\",\n  brand: \"Some Vendor 2\",\n});\n```\n\n### Add to Cart\n\nA sample `track` call mapped to the Spotify Pixel `addtocart` event is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"Add to Cart\", {\n  price: 23.2, \n  currency: \"USD\",\n  product_id: \"1234000\",\n  name: \"goldenTest\",\n  product_type: \"Card\",\n  brand: \"testVendor\",\n});\n```\n\nThe following table lists the mapping between the **optional** RudderStack event properties and the Spotify Pixel attributes:\n\n| RudderStack property | Spotify Pixel property |\n| --- | --- |\n| `properties.price` | `value` |\n| `properties.currency` | `currency` |\n| `properties.product_id` | `product_id` |\n| `properties.name` | `product_name` |\n| `properties.product_type` | `product_type` |\n| `properties.brand` | `product_vendor` |\n| `properties.quantity` | `quantity` |\n| `properties.variant_id` | `variant_id` |\n| `properties.variant_name` | `variant_name` |\n\nSimilar to the [Product](#sending-multiple-product-details) event, if you send the product details as an array in the `track` event, RudderStack fetches the details from each product item and calls the Spotify Pixel `addtocart` event for each item.\n\n### Check out\n\nA sample `track` call mapped to a Spotify Pixel `checkout` event is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"checkout\", {\n  price: 30.0,\n  currency: \"USD\",\n  discount_code: \"PODCAST_CODE_TEST\",\n  quantity: 3,\n  line_items: [{\n    price: 21.2,\n    quantity: 1,\n    product_id: \"1234000\",\n    product_name: \"goldenTest\",\n    product_type: \"Card\",\n    product_vendor: \"testVendor\",\n    variant_id: \"11112\",\n    variant_name: \"Test\",\n  }],\n});\n```\n\nThe following table lists the mapping between the **optional** RudderStack event properties and the Spotify Pixel attributes:\n\n| RudderStack property | Spotify Pixel property |\n| --- | --- |\n| `properties.price` | `value` |\n| `properties.currency` | `currency` |\n| `properties.quantity` | `quantity` |\n| `properties.variant_id` | `variant_id` |\n| `properties.discount_code` | `discount_code` |\n| `properties.line_items` | `line_items` |\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> If you do not pass the `line_items` object, then RudderStack fetches the `line_items` from the event’s properties and maps them to Spotify Pixel’s `line_items` field.\n\n#### Passing multiple product items\n\nIf you pass multiple product items as an array, then RudderStack fetches the individual product details and internally builds the `line_items` object before passing it on to Spotify Pixel via the `checkout` event, as demonstrated in the following example:\n\nConsider the following `track` event:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"Checkout\", {\n  price: 10.0,\n  currency: \"USD\",\n  quantity: 2,\n  discount_code: 'POD_CODE',\n  products: [{\n      price: 21.6,\n      quantity: 12,\n      product_id: \"SKU123\",\n      name: \"Card Game\",\n      product_type: \"Card\",\n      brand: \"Some Vendor\",\n      variant_id: 'test123',\n      variant_name: 'Test 123',\n    },\n    {\n      price: 42.4,\n      quantity: 2,\n      product_id: \"SKU124\",\n      name: \"Floppy Disk\",\n      product_type: \"Card123\",\n      brand: \"Some Vendor\",\n      variant_id: 'test124',\n      variant_name: 'Test 124',\n    },\n  ],\n});\n```\n\nRudderStack internally collates all product information and builds the `line_items` array before sending it to Spotify Pixel:\n\n```\npdst('checkout', {\n  price: 10.0,\n  currency: 'USD',\n  discount_code: 'POD_CODE',\n  quantity: 2,\n  line_items: [{\n      price: 21.6,\n      quantity: 12,\n      product_id: 'SKU123',\n      product_name: 'Card Game',\n      product_type: 'Card',\n      product_vendor: 'Some Vendor',\n      variant_id: 'test123',\n      variant_name: 'Test 123',\n    },\n    {\n      price: 42.4,\n      quantity: 2,\n      product_id: 'SKU124',\n      product_name: 'Floppy Disk',\n      product_type: 'Card123',\n      product_vendor: 'Some Vendor',\n      variant_id: 'test124',\n      variant_name: 'Test 124',\n    },\n  ],\n});\n```\n\n### Purchase\n\nA sample `track` call mapped to a Spotify Pixel `purchase` event is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"purchase\", {\n  price: 1000,\n  currency: \"rupee\",\n  discount_code: \"PODCAST_CODE\",\n  order_id: \"12322323232\",\n  is_new_customer: true,\n  quantity: 3,\n  line_items: [{\n    price: 21.2,\n    quantity: 1,\n    product_id: \"1234000\",\n    product_name: \"goldenTest\",\n    product_type: \"Card\",\n    product_vendor: \"testVendor\",\n    variant_id: \"11112222\",\n    variant_name: \"testTest\",\n  }],\n});\n```\n\nThe following table lists the mapping between the **optional** RudderStack event properties and the Spotify Pixel attributes:\n\n| RudderStack property | Spotify Pixel property |\n| --- | --- |\n| `properties.total`  <br>`properties.revenue` | `value` |\n| `properties.currency` | `currency` |\n| `properties.discount_code` | `discount_code` |\n| `properties.line_items` | `line_items` |\n| `properties.order_id` | `order_id` |\n| `properties.is_new_customer` | `is_new_customer` |\n| `properties.quantity` | `quantity` |\n\nSimilar to the [Check out](#passing-multiple-product-items) event, if you pass multiple product items as an array, then RudderStack fetches the individual product details and internally builds the `line_items` object before passing it on to Spotify Pixel via the `purchase` event.\n\n### Passing hashed internal ID to Spotify Pixel\n\nIf you turn on **Spotify Pixel Alias Event Setting** in the RudderStack dashboard and **Alias** events are configured for your Spotify Pixel, then RudderStack triggers a Spotify Pixel [`alias`](https://help.adanalytics.spotify.com/technical-pixel-docs) event capturing the hashed internal user ID along with every conversion event.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Note that:\n> \n> *   The Spotify Pixel `alias` event matches the Spotify Pixel internal cookie ID with your hashed internal user IDs.\n> *   RudderStack uses SHA-256 encryption for hashing your `userId`.\n\nTo enable this feature, follow these steps:\n\n1.  Activate **Alias Events** for Spotify Pixel from your dashboard:\n\n[![Spotify Pixel alias event setting](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/pixel-alias-event.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/pixel-alias-event.webp)\n\n2.  Enable the **Spotify Pixel Alias Event Setting** setting in the RudderStack dashboard.\n\nRudderStack automatically calls the Spotify Pixel `alias` event by mapping the following internal RudderStack IDs to Spotify Pixel:\n\n| RudderStack attribute | Spotify Pixel attribute |\n| --- | --- |\n| `userId`  <br>`context.traits.userId`  <br>`context.traits.id` | `id` |\n\nSuppose you send the following `track` call named `testEvent` (mapped to Spotify Pixel’s `lead` event) with the **Pass Internal ID** enabled:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"testEvent\", {\n  price: 100,\n  currency: \"euro\",\n  type: \"paper\",\n});\n```\n\nRudderStack then makes the following two calls to Spotify Pixel:\n\n[![Alias calls made to Spotify Pixel](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/spotify-alias-calls.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/spotify-alias-calls.webp)\n\n## Page\n\nYou can use the [`page`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/page/) call to record your website’s page views with any additional information about the viewed page.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> You can also set custom attributes inside the `page` event properties.\n\nRudderStack sends the `page` calls to Spotify Pixel as a `view` event.\n\nA sample `page` call is as shown:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.page(\"Home\", \"Clothes\", {\n  path: \"/best-seller/1\",\n  referrer: \"https://www.google.com/search?q=estore+bestseller\",\n  url: \"https://www.estore.com/best-seller/1\"\n});\n```\n\n### Supported property mappings\n\nRudderStack maps the following **optional** properties with the Spotify Pixel properties:\n\n| RudderStack property | Spotify Pixel property |\n| --- | --- |\n| `context.page.referrer` | `referrer` |\n| `context.page.url` | `url` |\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### Where can I find the Spotify Pixel ID?\n\n1.

Statsig automates the grunt work so that your A/B tests run automatically, and you always get the latest insights into how your product features are performing.\n\n> ![success](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/tick.svg)\n> \n> Read more about Statsig on their [website](https://statsig.com/). For more information on the Statsig-supported data connectors, refer to the [Statsig Documentation](https://docs.statsig.com/).\n\nRudderStack supports Statsig as a destination to which you can send real-time event data for efficient A/B testing.\n\n## Getting started\n\nBefore configuring Statsig as a destination in RudderStack, verify if the source platform is supported by Statsig by referring to the table below:\n\n| Connection Mode | Web | Mobile | Server |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Device mode** | \\-  | \\-  | \\-  |\n| **Cloud mode** | **Supported** | **Supported** | **Supported** |\n\nOnce you have confirmed that your source platform supports sending events to Statsig, follow these steps:\n\n1.  From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add the source. Then, from the list of destinations, select **Statsig**.\n2.  Assign a name to the destination and click **Next**.\n\n### Connection settings\n\nTo configure Statsig as a destination in RudderStack, enter the **Server Secret Key** associated with your project. To obtain the server secret key, follow these steps:\n\n1.  Log into your [Statsig console](https://console.statsig.com/).\n2.  Go to your project and click the **Settings** icon on the top right:\n\n[![Statsig settings](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/statsig-settings.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/statsig-settings.webp)\n\n3.  Finally, click **API Keys**.

It also lets you record any custom traits associated with that group, for example, the name of the company, number of employees, etc.\n\nA sample `group` call is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.group(\"12345\", {\n  name: \"MyGroup\",\n  industry: \"IT\",\n  employees: 450,\n  plan: \"basic\"\n})\n```\n\n## Alias\n\nThe [`alias`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/alias/) call lets you merge different identities of a known user.\n\n> ![success](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/tick.svg)\n> \n> `alias` is an advanced method that lets you change the tracked user’s ID explicitly. This method is useful when managing identities for some of the downstream destinations.\n\nA sample `alias` call is as shown:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.alias(\"12345\")\n```\n\nQuestions?

    "markdown": "# Visual Studio App Center | RudderStack Docs\n\nSend your event data from RudderStack to Visual Studio App Center.\n\n* * *\n\n*     7 minute read  \n    \n\n[App Center](https://appcenter.ms/) is Microsoft’s cross-platform build automation and management platform that lets you seamlessly manage your app’s lifecycle. With App Center, you can easily manage and automate your builds, effectively test your apps in the cloud, and monitor their real-time usage with the help of crash data and analytics.\n\nRudderStack lets you send your event data to App Center via its native web SDKs.\n\n## Getting started\n\nBefore configuring your source and destination in RudderStack, check whether the platform you are sending the events from is supported by App Center. Refer the following table to do so:\n\n| **Connection Mode** | **Web** | **Mobile** | **Server** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Device mode** | \\-  | **Supported** | \\-  |\n| **Cloud mode** | \\-  | \\-  | \\-  |\n\nOnce you have confirmed that the platform supports sending events to App Center, perform the steps below:\n\n*   From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add the source and select **App Center** from the list of destinations.\n*   Name your destination, and click **Next**. You should be able to see the following screen:\n\n[![Connection settings for App Center destination](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/appcenter.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/appcenter.webp)\n\n*   Enter the relevant details and click **Next** to complete the setup. The **API Secret Key** can be found as **App Secret** on the **Getting Started** page or **Settings** page on the App Center portal.\n\n## Adding device mode integration\n\nOnce you add App Center as a destination in the [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), follow these steps to add it to your mobile project depending on your integration platform:\n\nYour Android project must be on **version 5.0 (API level 21) or higher** for RudderStack to be able to send events to App Center.  \n\nOnce confirmed, follow these steps to add App Center to your Android project:\n\n1.  Add the following `dependencies` to your `app/build.gradle` file as shown:\n\n```\nimplementation 'com.rudderstack.android.sdk:core:1.7+'\nimplementation 'com.rudderstack.android.integration:appcenter:1.+'\nimplementation 'com.google.code.gson:gson:2.8.6'\n```\n\n2.  Also add the App Center `analytics` depedencies to your `app/build.gradle` as shown below:\n\n```\ndef appCenterSdkVersion = '4.1.0'\nimplementation \"com.microsoft.appcenter:appcenter-analytics:${appCenterSdkVersion}\"\n```\n\n3.  Make sure that the `minSdkVersion` in your `app/build.gradle` is atleast `21`.\n\n```\ndefaultConfig {\n  minSdkVersion 21\n}\n```\n\n4.  Finally, change the initialization of your `RudderClient` in your `Application` class:\n\n```\n// initializing Rudder SDK\nval rudderClient =\n    RudderClient.getInstance(\n        this,\n        WRITE_KEY,\n        RudderConfig.Builder()\n            .withDataPlaneUrl(DATA_PLANE_URL)\n            .withFactory(AppcenterIntegrationFactory.FACTORY)\n            .build()\n    )\n```\n\nFollow these steps to add App Center to your iOS project:\n\n5.  Go to your `Podfile` and add the `Rudder-AppCenter` extension\n\n6.  After adding the dependency followed by `pod install` , you can add the imports to your `AppDelegate.m` file:\n\n```\n#import <rudderappcenterfactory.h>\n```\n\n7.  Finally, change the initialization of your `RudderClient` as shown:\n\n```\nRSConfigBuilder *builder = [[RSConfigBuilder alloc] init];\n[builder withDataPlaneUrl:<your_data_plane_url>];\n[builder withFactory:[RudderAppCenterFactory instance]];\n[RSClient getInstance:<your_write_key> config:[builder build]];\n```\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> To use App Center, your iOS project must be set up in Xcode 11 or later on macOS version 10.14.4 or later. Also, you must be targeting devices running on iOS 9.0 or later.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> This device mode integration is supported for App Center v4.4.1 and above.\n\nFollow these steps to add App Center to your iOS project:\n\n1.  Install `RudderAppCenter` (available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/)) by adding the following line to your `Podfile`:\n\n```\npod 'RudderAppCenter', '~> 1.0.0'\n```\n\n2.  Run the `pod install` command.\n3.  Next, import the SDK depending on your preferred platform:\n\n4.  Next, add the imports to your `AppDelegate` file under `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` method:\n\n```\nRSConfig *config = [[RSConfig alloc] initWithWriteKey:WRITE_KEY];\n[config dataPlaneURL:DATA_PLANE_URL];\n\n[[RSClient sharedInstance] configureWith:config];\n[[RSClient sharedInstance] addDestination:[[RudderAppCenterDestination alloc] init]];\n```\n\n```\nlet config: RSConfig = RSConfig(writeKey: WRITE_KEY)\n            .dataPlaneURL(DATA_PLANE_URL)\n\nRSClient.sharedInstance().configure(with: config)\nRSClient.sharedInstance().addDestination(RudderAppCenterDestination())\n```\n\nTo add AppCenter to your React Native project, follow these steps:\n\n1.  Add the RudderStack-App Center module to your app as shown:\n\n```\nnpm install @rudderstack/rudder-integration-appcenter-react-native\n## OR ##\nyarn add @rudderstack/rudder-integration-appcenter-react-native\n```\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Make sure the `minSdkVersion` of your `build.gradle` in the root of `android` directory is atleast `21`\n\n2\\. Run \\`pod install\\` inside the \\`ios\\` directory of your project adding \\`@rudderstack/rudder-integration-appcenter-react-native\\` to your project. 3. Finally, import the module you added above and add it to your SDK initialization code:\n\n```\nimport rudderClient from \"@rudderstack/rudder-sdk-react-native\"\nimport appcenter from \"@rudderstack/rudder-integration-appcenter-react-native\"\n\nconst config = {\n  dataPlaneUrl: DATA_PLANE_URL,\n  trackAppLifecycleEvents: true,\n  withFactories: [appcenter],\n}\nrudderClient.setup(WRITE_KEY, config)\n```\n\nFollow the below steps to add App Center to your Flutter Project:\n\n1.  Add the following dependency to the `dependencies` section of your `pubspec.yaml` file.\n\n```\nrudder_integration_appcenter_flutter: ^1.1.1\n```\n\n2.  Run the below command to install the dependency added in the above step:\n\n3.  Import the `RudderIntegrationAppcenterFlutter` in your application where you are initializing the SDK.\n\n```\nimport 'package:rudder_integration_appcenter_flutter/rudder_integration_appcenter_flutter.dart';\n```\n\n4.  Finally, change the initialization of your `RudderClient` as shown:\n\n```\nfinal RudderController rudderClient = RudderController.instance;\nRudderConfigBuilder builder = RudderConfigBuilder();\nbuilder.withFactory(RudderIntegrationAppcenterFlutter());\nrudderClient.initialize(<write_key>, config: builder.build(), options: null);\n```\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> For Android platform, make sure that the `android.defaultConfig.minSdkVersion` is set to atleast `21` by checking it in the `android/app/build.gradle` file.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> For iOS platform, you can link App Center as a framework instead of a library with your application by linking it statically as shown below:\n> \n> ```\n> use_frameworks! :linkage=> :static\n> ```\n\nTo add App Center to your Cordova project, follow these steps:\n\n1.  Navigate to the root folder of your application and run the following command::\n\n```\ncordova plugin add rudder-integration-appcenter-cordova\n```\n\n2.  Add the platforms that you want to target for your app:\n\n```\ncordova platform add ios\ncordova platform add android\n```\n\n3.  Run the following command to build the project for all platforms:\n\n4.  Add the following code in the `onDeviceReady()` function of your home page to initialize the SDK:\n\n```\nRudderClient.initialize(WRITE_KEY , {\n  dataPlaneUrl: DATA_PLANE_URL,\n  factories: [RudderAppCenterFactory]\n})\n```\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Make sure to use the `await` keyword with the `initialize` call.\n\n## Track\n\nA `track` call lets you track custom events as they occur in your web application.\n\nA sample `track` call looks like the following:\n\n```\n[[RSClient sharedInstance] track:@\"Product Clicked\" properties:@{\n    @\"product_id\" : @\"pr01\",\n    @\"name\" : @\"Cadbury\"\n}];\n```\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> The above track call is directly passed on to App Center via its `trackEvent` api in both the RudderStack `Android` & `iOS` SDKs.\n\nThe `eventProperties` object should only contain the values of type `String` and `Number`\\- the other property types will be simply ignored, if sent.\n\nFor example, if `eventProperties` is set as:\n\n```\n{\n  \"colours\": [\n    \"red\",\n    \"black\"\n  ],\n  \"city\": \"New Orleans\",\n  \"state\": \"Louisiana\"\n}\n```\n\nthen RudderStack will send the data to App Center as:\n\n```\n{\n  \"city\": \"New Orleans\",\n  \"state\": \"Louisiana\"\n}\n```\n\n## Screen\n\nThe `screen` method allows you to record whenever a user sees the mobile screen, along with any associated optional properties. This call is similar to the `page` call, but is exclusive to your mobile device.\n\nA sample `screen` call using the RudderStack Android SDK looks like the following code snippet:\n\n```\n[[RSClient sharedInstance] screen:@\"Home\" properties:@{\n    @\"category\" : @\"launcher\"\n}];\n```\n\nIn the above snippet, RudderStack captures the information related to the screen being viewed, such as screen’s name and category.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> The above `screen` call is directly passed on to App Center as a `track` event via its `trackEvent` API, with event name as `Viewed {screen name} screen` along with the its properties. The above example will be sent as a `track` event with name `Viewed MainActivity screen` along with its properties.\n\n## Opting in/out of sending user data to App Center\n\nAny users visting your app can express their consent over sending data to App Center. Based on this consent you can either opt in or out of sending that user’s data to App Center.\n\nRefer to the section below for more details on how to use this feature.\n\nFirstly import Appcenter’s `Analytics` Module as shown below: `groovy import com.microsoft.appcenter.analytics.Analytics;`\n\nThen add the below script just after the initialization of the Android SDK:\n\n```\nrudderClient.onIntegrationReady(\"App Center\") {\n    // have your own logic to get the user consent\n    if (userConsent) {\n        // enabling appcenter's analytics module\n        Analytics.setEnabled(true)\n    } else {\n        // disabling appcenter's analytics module\n        Analytics.setEnabled(false)\n    }\n}\n```\n\nFirstly import the Appcenter’s `Analytics` Module as shown below:\n\n```\n@import AppCenterAnalytics;\n```\n\nThen add the below script just after the initialization of the iOS SDK:\n\n```\nif(userConsent)\n{\n    // enabling appcenter's analytics module\n    [MSACAnalytics setEnabled:true];\n}\nelse\n{\n    // disabling appcenter's analytics module\n    [MSACAnalytics setEnabled:false];\n}\n```\n\nFirstly import the `AppCenterIntegrationFactory` as shown below:\n\n```\nimport {\n  enableAnalytics,\n  disableAnalytics,\n} from '@rudderstack/rudder-integration-appcenter-react-native';\n```\n\nThen add the below script just after the initalization of the React Native SDK:\n\n*   To enable App Center Analytics:\n\n```\nawait rudderClient.registerCallback(\"App Center\", () => {\n  enableAnalytics();\n});\n```\n\n*   To disable App Center Analytics:\n\n```\nawait rudderClient.registerCallback(\"App Center\", () => {\n  disableAnalytics();\n});\n```\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### How do I get the App Center API secret?\n\nThe **API Secret Key** can be found as **App Secret** on the **Getting Started** page or **Settings** page on your App Center portal.\n\n#### What is transmission interval?\n\nThe App Center SDK uploads logs in a batch of 50. If the SDK doesn’t have 50 logs to send, it will still send logs after 3 seconds (set by default). There can be a maximum of 3 batches sent in parallel. In this case, this interval of 3 seconds is the **transmission interval**. Note that the value of this transmission interval must always be between 3 seconds and 86400 seconds (one day).\n\nQuestions?

From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add a source. Then, from the list of destinations, select **Vitally**.\n2.  Assign a name to the destination and click **Continue**.\n\n## Connection settings\n\nTo successfully configure Vitally as a destination, you will need to configure the following settings:\n\n*   **API Key**: Enter your Vitally API key. For more information on obtaining the API key, refer to the [FAQ](#faq) section below.\n\n## Identify\n\nThe [`identify`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/identify/) call lets you identify a user and associate them to their actions. It also lets you record any traits about them like their name, email, etc.\n\nA sample `identify` event is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify('1hKOmRA4GRlm', {\n  name: 'Alex Keener',\n  email: 'alex@example.com',\n  avatar: 'https://example.com/avatars/alexkeener.webp',\n  role: 'CEO'\n});\n```\n\nVitally uses the information from the `identify` calls to consolidate the user profile. Also, you can use the traits for sorting and filtering users within an account.\n\nYou can view the following `identify` traits in the Vitally dashboard:\n\n| Trait | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `name` | Sets the username in Vitally. |\n| `email` | Sets the user’s email. |\n| `avatar` | Displays the user’s avatar in the Vitally dashboard. |\n\n## Track\n\nThe [`track`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/track/) method lets you capture user events along with the properties associated with them.\n\nA sample `track` call is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track('Enabled Slack Integration', {\n  channel: '#support'\n})\n```\n\nVitally uses the `track` calls to track and analyze the account’s (user’s) engagement with your product. It provides out-of-the-box analysis for your events and the ability to define your own custom metrics on top of them, for example, [Success Metrics](https://docs.vitally.io/account-health-scores-and-metrics/success-metrics) and [Elements](https://docs.vitally.io/account-health-scores-and-metrics/elements).\n\n## Group\n\nThe [`group`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/group/) call lets you link an identified user with a group like a company, organization, or an account.\n\nA sample `group` call is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.group(\"group01\", {\n  name: \"Initech\",\n  industry: \"Technology\",\n  plan: \"enterprise\",\n  mrr: 2000\n});\n```\n\nVitally uses the `group` events to maintain a picture of the account. It adds any group traits to the account which you can use to analyze your customer base as a whole. You can view a customer’s traits on their dashboard, use these traits for sorting and filtering, configure rules to automate your customer success process, and much more.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack sets the group trait `name` as the account name in the Vitally dashboard.\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### Where can I find the Vitally API key?\n\n1.  From your [Vitally dashboard](https://login.vitally.io/), go to **Account Settings** > **Product Data** integrations list.\n2.  Select and enable the RudderStack integration.

For more information on this setting, refer to the [Sending experiment viewed from VWO](#sending-experiment-viewed-from-vwo) section below.\n*   **Send experiment viewed as identify traits**: Enable this setting to send your experiment data within the [traits](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/identify/#identify-traits) of your `identify` event.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> If you enable both the **Send experiment viewed as track** and **Send experiment viewed as identify traits** settings, then RudderStack independently captures the experiment details and sends them as `track` and `identify` events, respectively.\n\n*   **Client-side Events Filtering**: This setting lets you specify which events should be blocked or allowed to flow through to VWO. For more information, refer to the [Client-side Events Filtering](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/event-filtering/) guide.\n*   **Library Tolerance**: Specify the maximum time (in ms) RudderStack should wait for the VWO library to load before displaying your web page.\n*   **Setting Tolerance**: Specify the maximum time (in ms) RudderStack should wait for the test settings before VWO displays your original web page.\n*   **Use Existing jQuery**: Enable this setting if your page already includes jQuery. Otherwise, VWO will include jQuery on the page for you.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> To function correctly, VWO requires jQuery to be present in the web page.\n\n*   **Use device mode to send events**: As this is a [web device mode](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#device-mode)\\-only destination, this setting is enabled by default and cannot be disabled.\n\n## Loading the VWO SDK\n\nBy default, RudderStack **does not** load the VWO SDK automatically. To do so, you must [load the web SDK](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/load-js-sdk/) as follows:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.load(WRITE_KEY, DATA_PLANE_URL, {\n  integrations: {\n    VWO: {\n      loadIntegration: true\n    }\n  }\n});\n```\n\n## Identify\n\nYou can use the [`identify`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/identify/) call to identify a user and send the information to VWO.\n\nA sample `identify` call is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify(\"1hKOmRA4GRlm\", {\n  \"name\": \"Alex Keener\",\n  \"email\": \"alex@example.com\"\n});\n```\n\n### Sending user traits\n\nRudderStack lets you send the experiment-related data like the user’s traits via an [`identify`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/identify/) call, so that the other destinations have the necessary user-related context of the variations.\n\nTo do so, enable the **Send experiment viewed as identify traits** dashboard setting and include the user traits in the [`identify`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/identify/) event.\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify(\"1hKOmRA4GRlm\", {\n  \"name\": \"Alex Keener\",\n  \"email\": \"alex@example.com\",\n  \"Experiment: 1234\": \"Signup as default landing\"\n});\n```\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack prefixes all the `identify` traits with `rudder.` before sending them to VWO. For example, RudderStack sends `email` as `rudder.email` to VWO.\n\n## Track\n\nYou can use the [`track`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/track/) call to send user events and their associated properties to VWO.\n\nA sample `track` call is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"Item Purchased\", {\n  category: \"MyCategory\",\n  currency: \"INR\",\n  value: 500\n})\n```\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack prefixes the event name with `rudder.` before sending it to VWO. For example, `Item Purchased` event is sent as `rudder.Item Purchased` to VWO.\n\n### Sending `Experiment Viewed` as `track` event\n\nWhen you enable the **Send experiment viewed as track** dashboard setting, RudderStack automatically sends a [`track`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/track/) event whenever an experiment variation is loaded for a user. It sets `Experiment Viewed` as the event name along with the experiment and variation details as the event properties.\n\nYou can then send this `track` event to the other destinations (connected to the same source in RudderStack) to analyze the experimentation results.\n\nA sample code snippet for this activity is as shown:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"Experiment Viewed\", {\n  experimentId: \"Signup\",\n  variationName: \"Signup as a default landing\"\n});\n```\n\n### Tracking revenue goals\n\nRudderStack also lets you forward the revenue amount to VWO when the [`Order Completed`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/ecommerce-events-spec/ordering/#order-completed) event is called.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack uses the `revenue` or `amount` property for tracking the revenue goals.\n\nA sample code snippet for this activity is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"Order Completed\", {\n  revenue: 125\n});\n```\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### How do I add the VWO JavaScript snippet to my website?\n\nTo configure VWO SmartCode(JavaScript snippet) on all web pages where you plan to run your A/B tests, you can refer to this [VWO Knowledge Base](https://help.vwo.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019422834) article.\n\n#### Where can I find my VWO Account ID?\n\nYou can obtain the VWO Account ID by following these steps:\n\n1.  Log into your [VWO dashboard](https://app.vwo.com/#/login).\n2.  Click the settings icon on the top right and go to **Account**.\n\nYou will find your account ID listed under **Account Details**.\n\nFor more information, refer to the [VWO Knowledge Base](https://help.vwo.com/hc/en-us/articles/360008469173-How-to-find-your-account-ID).\n\n#### How can I disable loading the VWO SDK for certain events?\n\nBy default, RudderStack **does not** load the VWO SDK automatically. However, if you have loaded the VWO SDK using [this approach](#loading-the-vwo-sdk), you can disable it for certain events by setting `VWO` to `false` in the event’s `integrations` object:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\n  \"Experiment Viewed\", {\n    revenue: 30,\n    currency: \"USD\",\n  }, {\n    integrations: {\n      VWO: false\n    },\n  }\n);\n```\n\nQuestions?

    "markdown": "# WebEngage | RudderStack Docs\n\nSend your event data from RudderStack to WebEngage.\n\n* * *\n\n*     6 minute read  \n    \n\n[WebEngage](https://webengage.com/) is a full stack marketing automation tool. It lets you drive growth for your businesses by engaging your users via push and in-app notifications, email campaigns, etc. You can also leverage WebEngage’s analytics capabilities to get a 360-degree view of your users and the product.\n\nRudderStack supports WebEngage as a destination to which you can seamlessly send your event data for efficient marketing and analytics.\n\n## Getting started\n\nBefore configuring WebEngage as a destination in RudderStack, verify if the source platform is supported by WebEngage by referring to the table below:\n\n| **Connection Mode** | **Web** | **Mobile** | **Server** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Device mode** | \\-  | \\-  | \\-  |\n| **Cloud mode** | **Supported** | **Supported** | **Supported** |\n\nOnce you have confirmed that the source platform supports sending events to WebEngage, follow these steps:\n\n1.  From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add a source. Then, from the list of destinations, select **WebEngage**.\n2.  Assign a name to the destination and click **Continue**.\n\n### Connection settings\n\nTo successfully configure WebEngage as a destination, you will need to configure the following settings:\n\n[![WebEngage connection settings](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/webengage-connection-settings.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/webengage-connection-settings.webp)\n\n*   **License Code**: Enter your WebEngage license code.\n*   **API Key**: Enter your WebEngage API key.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> To get your WebEngage license code and API key, log into your WebEngage dashboard and go to **Data Platform** > **Integrations** > **REST API**. For more information, refer to the [FAQ](#faq) section below.\n\n*   **Data Center**: Select your WebEngage data center from the dropdown.\n\n## Identify\n\nThe [`identify`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/identify/) method lets you identify a user and associate them to their actions. It also lets you record any traits about them like their name, email, etc.\n\nRudderStack uses the `identify` call to create or update the customer information in WebEngage. It maps `userId` or `anonymousId` (`userId` is prioritized if both are present ) to WebEngage’s `userId` before sending the data via the [`users`](https://docs.webengage.com/docs/rest-api-tracking-users#users) API.\n\nA sample `identify` call is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify(\"1hKOmRA4GRlm\", {\n  email: \"alex@example.com\",\n  phone: \"+1-202-555-0146\",\n});\n```\n\n### Traits mapping\n\nRudderStack maps the following `identify` traits to the corresponding WebEngage attributes:\n\n| RudderStack trait | WebEngage attribute | Presence | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `userId` | `userId` | Required if `anonymousId` is not present. | `userId` cannot exceed 100 characters. |\n| `anonymousId` | `anonymousId` | Required if `userId` is not present. | `anonymousId` cannot exceed 100 characters. |\n| `firstName` | `firstName` | Optional | The user’s first name. |\n| `lastName` | `lastName` | Optional | The user’s last name. |\n| `birthday`/`dateOfBirth`/`dateofbirth`/`dob`/`DOB` | `birthDate` | Optional | The user’s birth date in the ISO format: `yyyy-MM-dd`. |\n| `gender` | `gender` | Optional | The user’s gender. |\n| `email` | `email` | Optional | The user’s email. |\n| `phone` | `phone` | Optional | The user’s phone. |\n| `emailOptIn` | `emailOptIn` | Optional | The user’s email subscription preference. |\n| `smsOptIn` | `smsOptIn` | Optional | The user’s SMS subscription preference. |\n| `whatsappOptIn` | `whatsappOptIn` | Optional | The user’s WhatsApp subscription preference. |\n| `company.name` | `company` | Optional | The user’s company. |\n| `hashedEmail` | `hashedEmail` | Optional | The user’s hashed email for email services. |\n| `hashedPhone` | `hashedPhone` | Optional | The user’s encrypted phone number for SMS services. |\n| `postalcode` / `address.postalCode` | `postalCode` | Optional | The user’s postal code. |\n| `region` / `address.region` | `region` | Optional | The user’s region. |\n| `locality` / `address.locality` | `locality` | Optional | The user’s locality. |\n| `city` / `address.city` | `city` | Optional | The user’s city. |\n| `country` / `address.country` | `country` | Optional | The user’s country. |\n| `attributes` | `attributes` | Optional | The user’s custom attributes as key-value pairs. |\n\n### Identify traits considerations\n\nNote the following when sending `identify` traits to WebEngage:\n\n*   Either `userId` or `anonymousId` must be present in the `identify` call.\n*   If both `userId` and `anonymousId` are present in the `identify` call, RudderStack ignores `anonymousId`.\n*   WebEngage prioritizes `hashedEmail` over `email`. Hence, once you set `hashedEmail`, it can then be updated only through a new `hashedEmail`.\n*   WebEngage prioritizes `hashedPhone` over `phone`. Hence, once you set `hashedPhone`, it can then be updated only through a new `hashedPhone`.\n\n## Track\n\nThe [`track`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/track/) method lets you capture user events along with the properties associated with them.\n\nRudderStack uses the `track` call to send the custom events to WebEngage via the [`events`](https://docs.webengage.com/docs/rest-api-tracking-events#events) API.\n\nA sample `track` call is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"Order Completed\", {\n  timestamp: \"2022-05-05T14:58:10.000Z\",\n  currency: \"USD\",\n  checkout_id: \"X23441\",\n  order_id: \"ORD00123\"\n});\n```\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> Make sure you call `identify` before `track` for RudderStack to include the `userId` in the `track` events. Otherwise, RudderStack will send the `track` calls to WebEngage with an `anonymousId`.\n\n### Property mapping\n\nRudderStack maps the following event properties to the corresponding WebEngage attributes:\n\n| RudderStack trait | WebEngage attribute | Presence | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `userId` | `userId` | Required if `anonymousId` is not present. | `userId` cannot exceed 100 characters. |\n| `anonymousId` | `anonymousId` | Required if `userId` is not present. | `anonymousId` cannot exceed 100 characters. |\n| `eventName` | `event` | Required | The event name. |\n| `timestamp`/`originalTimestamp` | `eventTime` | Optional | The date and time of the event in ISO format: `yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss±hhmm`. |\n| `properties` | `eventData` | Optional | The custom event attributes as key-value pairs. |\n\n### Setting custom attributes\n\nWebEngage lets you send custom attributes as key-value pairs in the `eventData` parameter as described in the [above section](#property-mapping). However, there are a few things you should keep in mind:\n\n*   WebEngage ignores any custom attributes starting with `we_` as these are reserved for internal use.\n*   User attribute names must be less than 50 characters, while the `string` attribute values cannot exceed 1000 characters. WebEngage automatically truncates any additional characters.\n*   You can create a maximum of 25 custom user attributes of each data type.\n*   If the attribute value is a JSON object, it can only be used to personalize your campaigns. These attributes cannot be used to create user segments.\n*   Once defined, the data type of a custom user attribute cannot be changed again.\n\n## Page\n\nThe [`page`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/page/) call lets you record your website’s page views with any additional relevant information about the viewed page.\n\nRudderStack internally transforms the `page` call into a `track` call before sending it as a custom event to WebEngage. It sends the event/category name by transforming it in the `Viewed ${category} ${name} page` format.\n\nFor example, consider the following `page` call:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.page(\"Home\", \"Clothes\", {\n  path: \"/best-seller/1\",\n  referrer: \"https://www.google.com/search?q=estore+bestseller\",\n  search: \"estore bestseller\",\n  title: \"The best sellers offered by EStore\",\n  url: \"https://www.estore.com/best-seller/1\"\n});\n```\n\nRudderStack transforms the above event into a `track` call named `Viewed Home Clothes page` and sends it to WebEngage as a custom event.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack sends the `page` event properties to WebEngage, similar to the `track` event properties.\n\n## Screen\n\nThe [`screen`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/screen/) method lets you record whenever your user views their mobile screen with any additional relevant information about the screen. It is the mobile equivalent of a [](#page)call.\n\nRudderStack internally transforms the `screen` call into a `track` call before sending it as a custom event to WebEngage. It sends the event/category name by transforming it in the `Viewed ${category} ${name} screen` format.\n\nFor example, consider the following `screen` call:\n\n```\nrudderClient.screen(\n    \"Games\",\n    \"home\",\n    RudderProperty().putValue(\"foo\", \"bar\"),\n    null\n)\n```\n\nRudderStack transforms the above event into a `track` call named `Viewed Games home screen` and sends it to WebEngage as a custom event.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack sends the `screen` event properties to WebEngage, similar to the `track` event properties.\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### Where can I find the WebEngage License Code and API key?\n\nTo get your WebEngage License Code and API key, follow these steps:\n\n1.  Log into your [WebEngage dashboard](https://dashboard.webengage.com/).\n2.  Go to **Data Platform** > **Integrations** > **REST API**.\n3.

    "markdown": "# Woopra | RudderStack Docs\n\nSend your event data from RudderStack to Woopra.\n\n* * *\n\n*     6 minute read  \n    \n\n[Woopra](https://www.woopra.com/) is a customer journey and product analytics tool. It lets you track your customers’ activities across various product, marketing, and sales touchpoints. You can also leverage built-in triggers to take real-time actions based on user behavior.\n\nRudderStack supports Woopra as a destination where you can send your event data seamlessly.\n\n## Getting started\n\nRudderStack supports sending event data to Woopra via the following [connection modes](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/):\n\n| **Connection Mode** | **Web** | **Mobile** | **Server** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Device mode** | **Supported** | \\-  | \\-  |\n| **Cloud mode** | **Supported** | **Supported** | **Supported** |\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> In a web device mode integration, that is, using [JavaScript SDK](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/) as a source, the Woopra native SDK is loaded from `https://static.woopra.com/` domain. Based on your website’s content security policy, you might need to [allowlist this domain](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/load-js-sdk/#allowlist-destination-domain) to load the Woopra SDK successfully.\n\nOnce you have confirmed that the source platform supports sending events to Woopra, follow these steps:\n\n1.  From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add the source. Then, from the list of destinations, select **Woopra**.\n2.  Assign a name to the destination and click **Continue**.\n\n## Connection settings\n\nTo successfully configure Woopra as a destination, you need to configure the following settings:\n\n[![Woopra connection settings](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/woopra-connection-settings-1.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/woopra-connection-settings-1.webp)\n\n*   **Project Name**: Enter your Woopra project name. This is the domain name you entered while setting up your project.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> For more information on getting your Woopra project name, refer to the [FAQ](#faq) section below.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack uses this project name as a fallback value if it is not specified in the event’s `integrations` object. For more information, refer to the [Identify](#identify) section below.\n\nTo send the events to Woopra via [web device mode](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#device-mode), you also need to configure the following settings:\n\n[![Woopra connection settings](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/woopra-connection-settings-2.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/woopra-connection-settings-2.webp)\n\n[![Woopra connection settings](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/woopra-connection-settings-3.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/woopra-connection-settings-3.webp)\n\n*   **Cookie Name**: Enter the name of the cookie used to identify the visitor.\n*   **Cookie Domain**: Enter the domain scope of the Woopra cookie.\n*   **Click Tracking**: Enable this setting to track user click interactions via links and buttons.\n*   **Cookie Path**: Specify the cookie path that stores all information related to tracking user click interactions via links and buttons.\n*   **Download Tracking**: If enabled, this setting lets you track the downloads on your web page.\n*   **Hide Campaign**: Enable this setting to remove the captured campaign properties from the URL.\n*   **Idle Timeout**: Enter the inactivity time (in ms) after which RudderStack considers the user to be offline.\n*   **Ignore Query URL**: If enabled, RudderStack ignores the URL’s query component when the standard page view is called.\n*   **Outgoing Ignore Subdomain**: If enabled, RudderStack does not track the links to the subdomains as outgoing links.\n*   **Outgoing Tracking**: Enable this setting to track the external link clicks on the web page.\n*   **Client-side Events Filtering**: This setting lets you specify which events should be blocked or allowed to flow through to Woopra.\n\n*   **Use device mode to send events**: This setting **must be enabled** to send the events to Woopra via web device mode.\n*   **OneTrust Cookie Categories**: If **Use device mode to send events** is enabled, this setting lets you associate [OneTrust](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/data-governance/consent-management/onetrust/javascript/) cookie consent groups to Woopra.\n\n## Identify\n\nYou can use the [`identify`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/identify/) call to update the visitor properties in Woopra.\n\nRudderStack uses the [`identify`](https://docs.woopra.com/reference/track-identify) endpoint to send the user information to Woopra.\n\nA sample `identify` call is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify(\"1hKOmRA4GRlm\", {\n  state: \"Louisiana\",\n  firstName: \"Alex\",\n  lastName: \"Keener\",\n  country: \"USA\",\n  email: \"alex@example.com\",\n  integrations: {\n    \"woopra\": {\n      \"projectName\": \"abc.com\"\n    }\n  }\n});\n```\n\nYou can specify your Woopra project name within the `integrations` object of the `identify` event, as seen in the above snippet. Alternatively, you can specify the project name via the **Project Name** dashboard setting while configuring the destination.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> If you provide the Woopra project name in both the dashboard settings as well as the `integrations` object, RudderStack gives precedence to the name specified in the `integrations` object.\n\nRudderStack uses the below fields to identify a user in the same order of precedence:\n\n| Precedence order | RudderStack property | Woopra property |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1   | `userId` / `traits.userId` / `traits.id` / `context.traits.userId` / `context.traits.id` | `cv_id` |\n| 2   | `traits.email` / `context.traits.email` / `properties.email` | `cv_email` |\n| 3   | `context.externalId.woodpraId` / `anonymousId` | `cookie` |\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> For a detailed list of the supported property mappings, refer to the [Standard property mappings](#standard-property-mappings) section below.\n\nAny user-provided cookie must be mapped to either `email` or `userId` when creating a new user or using the cookie for the first time. Otherwise, Woopra accepts the data but reflects it **only when** that cookie is mapped to any of these identifiers. For example, Woopra accepts the following event but does not reflect the data in the dashboard:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify({\n  name: \"Alex Keener\",\n  country: \"USA\",\n} {\n  externalId: [{\n    id: \"some_external_id_1\",\n    type: \"woopraId\",\n  }, ],\n});\n```\n\nWhen you include a user identifier (`email`) in the subsequent events as shown below, Woopra reflects all user information present in the current and previous events.\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify({\n  name: \"Alex Keener\",\n  email: \"alex@example.com\",\n  country: \"USA\",\n} {\n  externalId: [{\n    id: \"some_external_id_1\",\n    type: \"woopraId\",\n  }, ],\n});\n```\n\n## Track\n\nYou can use the [`track`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/track/) call to track events in Woopra via the [`ce`](https://docs.woopra.com/reference/track-ce) endpoint.\n\nA sample `track` event is as shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"Order Completed\", {\n  orderId: \"1234567\",\n  price: \"567\",\n  currency: \"USD\",\n});\n```\n\n### Supported mappings\n\nThe following table lists the supported **optional** property mappings between RudderStack and Woopra for the `track` events:\n\n| RudderStack property | Woopra property | Data type |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `event` | `event` | String (in lower case) |\n| `originalTimestamp` | `timestamp` | Unix timestamp (in ms) |\n| `properties.{x}` | `ce_{x}` | \\-  |\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> If the event name is empty, RudderStack sends an empty string to Woopra as well, as a default fallback.\n\n## Page\n\nWhen you send a [`page`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/track/) event, RudderStack converts it to a Woopra [`track`](https://docs.woopra.com/reference/track-ce#pageviews) event and sends all page-related information and the associated properties.\n\n### Supported mappings\n\nThe following table lists the supported **optional** property mappings between RudderStack and Woopra for the `page` events:\n\n| RudderStack property | Woopra property | Data type |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `properties.{x}` | `ce_{x}` | \\-  |\n| `Viewed <category> <name> Page` | `event` | String (in lower case) |\n\n## Standard property mappings\n\nThe following table lists the supported property mappings between RudderStack and Woopra, **common to all above events**:\n\n| RudderStack property | Woopra property | Data type | Presence |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `integration.woopra.propertyName` | `property` | Domain | Optional |\n| `userId` / `traits.userId` / `traits.id` / `context.traits.userId` / `context.traits.id` | `cv_id` | String | Required, if `cv_email` or `cookie` is absent. |\n| `traits.email` / `context.traits.email` / `properties.email` | `cv_email` | String | Required, if `cv_id` or `cookie` is absent. |\n| `context.externalId.woodpraId` / `anonymousId` | `cookie` | String | Required, if `cv_email` or `cv_id` is absent. |\n| `context.ip` | `cv_ip` | IP address | Optional |\n| `traits.company` | `cv_company` | String | Optional |\n| `traits.name` / `context.traits.name` | `cv_name` | String | Optional |\n| `traits.{x}` / `context.traits.{x}` | \\-  | Custom fields | Optional |\n| `context.device.type` | `device` | String | Optional |\n| `context.app.name` | `app` | String | Optional |\n| `ua.browser.name` + `ua.browser.version` | `browser` | String | Optional.

    "markdown": "# Set Up The Trade Desk Audience\n\nSend your event data from RudderStack to The Trade Desk Audience.\n\n* * *\n\n*     3 minute read  \n    \n\nThis guide will help you set up The Trade Desk Audience as a destination in RudderStack when connecting to a [Reverse ETL source](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/reverse-etl-destinations/trade-desk-audience/connect-retl-source/).\n\n## Setup\n\nIn your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), go to **Directory** > **Destinations** > **Cloud Destinations** and search for **The Trade Desk Audience**.\n\n### Connection settings\n\nConfigure the following settings to set up The Trade Desk Audience as a destination in RudderStack:\n\n*   **Name**: Specify a unique name to identify the destination in RudderStack.\n*   **Advertiser ID**: Enter the advertiser ID from the **Advertiser Preferences** page in the The Trade Desk dashboard.\n*   **Advertiser Secret Key**: Enter the advertiser secret key from The Trade Desk dashboard under **Advertiser Preferences** > **Seat Identifiers & Keys**. For more information, refer to the [The Trade Desk documentation](https://partner.thetradedesk.com/v3/portal/data/doc/DataAuthentication#secret-keys).\n*   **Data Server**: Select the preferred data server from dropdown. For more information, refer to the [The Trade Desk documentation](https://partner.thetradedesk.com/v3/portal/data/doc/DataEnvironments#1pd-servers).\n\n### Configuration settings\n\nConfigure the following settings in the **Configuration** tab of the The Trade Desk Audience destination:\n\n*   **TTL (in days)**: Enter the Time-to-Live (TTL) indicating the duration for which a user must remain active in the segment. The default TTL is set to 30 days and the maximum allowable TTL value is 180 days.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> Once the TTL expires, the user data gets removed from the data segments. You need to trigger a full sync to repopulate the data by going to the **Syncs** tab of your Reverse ETL source in the dashboard.\n\n## Sync first-party data\n\nRudderStack supports adding/deleting the IDs from the data segments in The Trade Desk Audience by using the [`POST /data/advertiser`](https://partner.thetradedesk.com/v3/portal/data/doc/post-data-advertiser-external) endpoint of The Trade Desk Audience API. It uploads the first-party data for the specified advertiser ID to perform audience targeting.\n\nRudderStack supports all the ID types mentioned in this \\[The Trade Desk API reference\\]([https://partner.thetradedesk.com/v3/portal/data/doc/post-data-advertiser-external#supported-ids](https://partner.thetradedesk.com/v3/portal/data/doc/post-data-advertiser-external#supported-ids). Refer to the documentation to know more about these ID types, their data type, and usage.\n\nRefer to the following request example with an external provider and different IDs:\n\n```\n{\n  \"DataProviderId\": \"test-dataProviderId\",\n  \"AdvertiserId\": \"test-advertiserId\",\n  \"Items\": [{\n      \"TDID\": \"123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426652340000\", // {ID_TYPE}\n      \"Data\": [{\n        \"Name\": \"1210\", // The name of the segment to which this ID will be added               \n        \"TimestampUtc\": \"2023-11-11T10:11:30+5000\",\n        \"TTLInMinutes\": 43200\n      }]\n    },\n    {\n      \"DAID\": \"234e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426652340000\", // {ID_TYPE}\n      \"Data\": [{\n        \"Name\": \"1210\", // The name of the segment to which this ID will be added\n        \"TimestampUtc\": \"2023-11-11T10:11:30+5000\",\n        \"TTLInMinutes\": 43200\n      }]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack internally splits the request into multiple batches to adhere to the batch limit of 2.5MB imposed by The Trade Desk Audience.\n\n### Upload UIDs using Snowflake source\n\nWhile using the [Snowflake source](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/reverse-etl/snowflake/) with The Trade Desk, you can use the [Unified ID 2.0 (UID2)](https://app.snowflake.com/marketplace/listing/GZT0ZRYXTMV/unified-id-2-0-unified-id-2-0-advertiser-identity-solution?originTab=provider&providerName=Unified%20ID%202.0) for advertising without exposing any sensitive directly identifying information.\n\nTo do this, [set up the UID2 Snowflake account](https://unifiedid.com/docs/guides/snowflake_integration) and interact with Snowflake’s UID2 function to convert the emails and phone numbers into UIDs. Once these UIDs are available in the Snowflake warehouse, RudderStack will upload them to The Trade Desk using its [First Party Data Endpoint](https://partner.thetradedesk.com/v3/portal/data/doc/post-data-advertiser-external).\n\nQuestions?

You can choose any of the following approaches based on your company’s security policies and setup preferences:\n\n#### Option 1: Use RudderStack IAM role\n\n> ![success](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/tick.svg)\n> \n> It is highly recommended to use this option for setting up the required S3 bucket permissions.\n\nUse this approach if you are going to set up the S3 destination in RudderStack using **Role Based Authentication**.\n\n[![Role based authentication](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/role-based-authentication.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/role-based-authentication.webp)\n\n1.  [Create a RudderStack IAM role](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/aws-iam-role-for-rudderstack/).\n2.  Use the following S3 permissions policy for creating the role:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n  \"Statement\": [{\n    \"Sid\": \"Statement1\",\n    \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n    \"Action\": [\n      \"s3:GetObject\",\n      \"s3:PutObject\",\n      \"s3:PutObjectAcl\",\n      \"s3:ListBucket\"\n    ],\n    \"Resource\": [\n      \"arn:aws:s3:::<S3_BUCKET_NAME>\",\n      \"arn:aws:s3:::<S3_BUCKET_NAME>/*\"\n    ]\n  }]\n}\n```\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> Replace `<S3_BUCKET_NAME>` with the actual bucket name.\n\n3.  After creating the role, note and specify the **IAM Role ARN** to set up your S3 data lake destination.\n\n#### Option 2: Create IAM user and provide credentials\n\n> ![danger](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/danger.svg)\n> \n> Note that:\n> \n> *   Using [**Role-based Authentication (Option 1)**](#option-1-use-rudderstack-iam-role) is highly recommended as this method is now deprecated and will be discontinued soon.\n> *   AWS **does not** recommend access key credentials-based authentication.\n\nUse this approach if you are going to set up the S3 data lake destination in RudderStack using the **Access Key Based Authentication**.\n\n[![Access key based authentication](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/access-key-based-authentication.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/access-key-based-authentication.webp)\n\n1.  Log in to your [Amazon AWS IAM Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/).\n2.  [Create an IAM user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html). Choose a policy that has **write** access to your bucket. Alternatively, you can [create a new policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_create-console.html#access_policies_create-start) with the following permissions and attach it to the IAM user:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n  \"Statement\": [{\n    \"Sid\": \"Statement1\",\n    \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n    \"Action\": [\n      \"s3:GetObject\",\n      \"s3:PutObject\",\n      \"s3:PutObjectAcl\",\n      \"s3:ListBucket\"\n    ],\n    \"Resource\": [\n      \"arn:aws:s3:::<S3_BUCKET_NAME>\",\n      \"arn:aws:s3:::<S3_BUCKET_NAME>/*\"\n    ]\n  }]\n}\n```\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> Replace `<S3_BUCKET_NAME>` with the actual bucket name.\n\n3.  Return to the IAM dashboard and go to **Users** under **Access management**. Then, click on the newly-created user.\n4.  Go to the **Security credentials** tab and scroll down to **Access keys**.\n5.  Click **Create access key**, select the use case as per your requirement, and click **Next**.\n6.  If required, set the **Description tag value**, and click **Create access key**.\n7.  Note and secure the **Access key** and **Secret access key**. Use these credentials to set up your S3 data lake destination in RudderStack.\n\n## Find data in S3 data lake\n\nRudderStack converts your events into Apache Parquet files and stores them into the configured S3 bucket. Before storing the events, RudderStack groups them by the event name based on the UTC time they were received.\n\nThe folder structure is shown below:\n\n```\ns3://<bucketName>/<prefix>/rudder-datalake/<namespace>/<tableName>/YYYY/MM/DD/HH\n```\n\nAs mentioned in the [Connection settings](#connection-settings) section:\n\n*   `prefix`: This is the S3 prefix in the destination settings. If not specified, RudderStack will omit this value.\n*   `namespace`: The namespace specified in the destination settings. If not specified, RudderStack sets this field to the source name by default.\n*   `tableName`: RudderStack sets this to the event name.\n*   `YYYY`, `MM`, `DD`, and `HH` are replaced by actual time values. A combination of these values represents the UTC time.\n\n#### Use case\n\nSuppose RudderStack tracks the following two events:\n\n| Event name | Timestamp |\n| --- | --- |\n| `Product Purchased` | `\"2019-10-12T08:40:50.52Z\" UTC` |\n| `Cart Viewed` | `\"2019-11-12T09:34:50.52Z\" UTC` |\n\nRudderStack converts these events into Parquet files and dumps them into the following folders:\n\n| Event name | Folder location |\n| --- | --- |\n| `Product Purchased` | `s3://<bucketName>/<prefix>/rudder-datalake/<namespace>/product_purchased/2019/10/12/08` |\n| `Cart Viewed` | `s3://<bucketName>/<prefix>/rudder-datalake/<namespace>/cart_viewed/2019/11/12/09` |\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> If you have the **Register schema on AWS Glue** setting toggled on, RudderStack creates all table definitions in a database with the name set to the **Namespace** specified in the dashboard settings.\n\n## Create table definitions using a crawler\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> Refer to this section **only** if you haven’t toggled on the **Register Schema on AWS Glue** setting while configuring the S3 data lake destination in RudderStack.\n\nIn the absence of AWS Glue, you can create a crawler to go through your data and create table definitions out of it. To do so, follow these steps:\n\n1.  Go to your AWS Glue console and select **Crawler** from the left pane.\n2.  Select **Add Crawler**.\n3.  Specify a name for your crawler and click **Next**:\n\n[![Add Crawler](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/dw-integrations/s3-datalake-crawler-1.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/dw-integrations/s3-datalake-crawler-1.webp)\n\n4.  Next, under the **Crawler source type** section, choose **Data stores**.\n\n[![Crawler source type](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/dw-integrations/s3-datalake-crawler-2.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/dw-integrations/s3-datalake-crawler-2.webp)\n\n5.  Configure the **Repeat crawls of S3 data stores** based on your requirement.\n6.  Then, under the **Data store** section, select **S3** from the dropdown for the **Choose a data store** setting:\n\n[![Choose a data store](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/dw-integrations/s3-datalake-crawler-3.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/dw-integrations/s3-datalake-crawler-3.webp)\n\n7.  For the **Crawl data in** setting, choose **Specified path in my account**.\n8.  In the **Include path** setting, enter the S3 URI of your configured bucket followed by the suffix `/<prefix>/rudder-datalake/<namespace>/`.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> If your S3 bucket name is `testBucket` and the configured prefix and namespace are `testPrefix` and `testNameSpace` respectively, then your path should be: `s3://testBucket/testPrefix/rudder-datalake/testNameSpace/`\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> If you have not configured any prefix while setting up the S3 data lake destination in RudderStack, omit the prefix. The path would then be: `s3://testBucket/rudder-datalake/testNameSpace/`.\n\n9.  Then, under the **Add another data store** setting, select **No**:\n\n[![Add another data store](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/dw-integrations/s3-datalake-crawler-4.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/dw-integrations/s3-datalake-crawler-4.webp)\n\n10.  In the **IAM Role** section, configure a suitable IAM role.\n\n[![IAM Role](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/dw-integrations/s3-datalake-crawler-5.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/dw-integrations/s3-datalake-crawler-5.webp)\n\n11.  In the **Schedule** section, select the frequency of your crawler from the dropdown options:\n\n[![Scheduler](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/dw-integrations/s3-datalake-crawler-6.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/dw-integrations/s3-datalake-crawler-6.webp)\n\n12.  In the **Output** section, configure the database that stores all tables. Under the Grouping behavior for S3 data section, turn on the **Create a single schema for each S3 path** option:\n\n[![Output](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/dw-integrations/s3-datalake-crawler-7.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/dw-integrations/s3-datalake-crawler-7.webp)\n\n13.  Specify the **Table level** as **5** or **4** (refer to the tips below). This value indicates the absolute level of the table location in the bucket.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> Since all tables are created in the path `s3://testBucket/<prefix>/rudder-datalake/<namespace>/`, make sure the table level is set to:\n> \n> *   **5**: If a prefix is configured.\n> *   **4**: If a prefix is **not** configured.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> The level for the top-level folder is 1. For example, for the path `mydataset/a/b`, if the level is set to 3, the table will be created at the location `mydataset/a/b`. Similarly, if the level is set to 2, the table will be created at the location `mydataset/a`.\n\n14.  Review your crawler configuration and click **Finish** to confirm.\n\n[![Review crawler configuration](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/dw-integrations/s3-datalake-crawler-8.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/dw-integrations/s3-datalake-crawler-8.webp)\n\n15.  Finally, click your crawler and run it. Wait for the process to finish - you should see some tables created in your configured database.\n\n## Query data using AWS Athena\n\nYou can query your S3 data using a tool like [AWS Athena](https://aws.amazon.com/athena/) which lets you run SQL queries on S3.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> Before querying your data on S3, make sure that you have sent some data to S3 and the sync is complete.\n\nFollow these steps to start querying your data on s3:\n\n1.  Open your AWS Athena console. Then, go to the same AWS region which was used while configuring AWS Glue.\n2.  In the left pane, select `AwsDataCatalog` as your data source:\n\n[![AwsDataCatalog](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/dw-integrations/s3-datalake-querying-data-1.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/dw-integrations/s3-datalake-querying-data-1.webp)\n\n3.  Select your configured namespace (or the database you specified while configuring the crawler) from the database dropdown menu.\n\n[![Database](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/dw-integrations/s3-datalake-querying-data-2.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/dw-integrations/s3-datalake-querying-data-2.webp)\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> By default, RudderStack sets the namespace to your source name if it is not explicitly specified in the destination settings.\n\n4.  You should see some tables already created under the **Tables** section in the left pane.\n5.  You can preview the data by clicking on the three dots next to the table and selecting the **Preview Data** option. Alternatively, you can run your own SQL queries in the workspace on the right:\n\n[![Preview Data](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/dw-integrations/s3-datalake-querying-data-3.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/dw-integrations/s3-datalake-querying-data-3.webp)\n\n## IPs to be allowlisted\n\nTo enable network access to RudderStack, allowlist the following RudderStack IPs depending on your region and [RudderStack Cloud plan](https://www.rudderstack.com/pricing):\n\n| Plan | Region |     |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|     | **<br><br>US<br><br>** | **<br><br>EU<br><br>** |\n| Free, Starter, and Growth | *   3.216.35.97<br>*   18.214.35.254<br>*   23.20.96.9<br>*   34.198.90.241<br>*   34.211.241.254<br>*   52.38.160.231<br>*   54.147.40.62 | *   3.123.104.182<br>*   3.125.132.33<br>*   18.198.90.215<br>*   18.196.167.201 |\n| Enterprise | *   3.216.35.97<br>*   34.198.90.241<br>*   44.236.60.231<br>*   54.147.40.62<br>*   100.20.239.77 | *   3.66.99.198<br>*   3.64.201.167<br>*   3.123.104.182<br>*   3.125.132.33 |\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> All the outbound traffic is routed through these RudderStack IPs.\n\n## AWS Lake Formation permissions\n\nAWS Lake Formation lets you have fine-grained access control for the data in your lake. You can use the Lake Formation permissions model to manage your existing AWS Glue data catalog objects and data locations in Amazon S3.\n\nTo maintain backward compatibility with AWS Glue, Lake Formation has the [`Super` permission](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lake-formation/latest/dg/upgrade-glue-lake-formation-background.html) for the `IAMAllowedPrincipals` group on all the existing AWS Glue data catalog resources.\n\nThe following sections contain the necessary permissions that you need to assign for the [configured IAM role](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/aws-iam-role-for-rudderstack/#creating-a-rudderstack-iam-role) **if** you have edited the default Lake Formation security settings so that:\n\n*   The IAM role does not have the data lake administrator permissions, or\n*   The `IAMAllowedPrincipals` group does not have the default permissions to create or access the Glue resources.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Make sure **Register schema on AWS Glue** is enabled in the RudderStack dashboard for these settings to take effect.\n\n#### Database creator permissions\n\n1.  Log in to your [AWS management console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/) and go to Lake Formation settings.\n2.  Under **Administration**, go to **Administrative roles and tasks**.\n3.  Under **Database creators**, add the configured IAM role.\n\n[![Database creators in AWS Lake Formation](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/dw-integrations/lakeformation-database-creators.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/dw-integrations/lakeformation-database-creators.webp)\n\n#### Data location permissions\n\nData location permissions in Lake Formation enable you to create and alter the data catalog resources that point to a specific S3 location. These permissions work in addition to the Lake Formation permissions to secure the data in your data lake.\n\nThis section assumes a data location is registered for your AWS Lake Formation.\n\n[![Database creators in AWS Lake Formation](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/dw-integrations/lakeformation-register-location.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/dw-integrations/lakeformation-register-location.webp)\n\nTo provide the [data location permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lake-formation/latest/dg/granting-location-permissions.html) for the configured IAM role, follow these steps:\n\n1.  Under **Permissions**, click **Data locations**.\n2.  Add the configured IAM role to grant permissions to the storage location.\n\n[![Database creators in AWS Lake Formation](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/dw-integrations/lakeformation-location-permissions.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/dw-integrations/lakeformation-location-permissions.webp)\n\n#### Resource access permissions\n\n1.  Go to **Permissions** > **Data lake permissions**.\n2.  Grant the following access permissions for either `IAMAllowedPrincipals` or the configured IAM role.\n\n*   `CREATE_TABLE` granted on `DATABASE` resource.\n*   `ALTER` granted on `TABLE` resource.\n*   `DESCRIBE` granted on `TABLE` resource.\n\nSee [Granting and revoking permissions on Data Catalog resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lake-formation/latest/dg/granting-catalog-permissions.html) for more information.\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\nThe following table lists the possible permissions-related errors you might encounter while setting up the S3 data lake destination and their solutions:\n\n| Verification step | Error | Solution |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Verifying Create Schema | AccessDeniedException: Insufficient Lake Formation permission(s): Required Create Database on Catalog | [Provide database creator permissions for the configured IAM role](#database-creator-permissions). |\n| Verifying Create and Alter Table | create table: AccessDeniedException: Insufficient Lake Formation permission(s) on s3://path/you/have/configured | [Provide data location permissions for the configured IAM role](#data-location-permissions). |\n| Verifying Create and Alter Table | create table: AccessDeniedException: Insufficient Lake Formation permission(s): Required Create Table on xxx | [Provide resource access for the configured IAM role](#resource-access-permissions). |\n\n## FAQ\n\nFor a comprehensive FAQ list, refer to the [Warehouse FAQ](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/warehouse-destinations/faq/) guide.\n\nQuestions?

    "markdown": "# Azure data lake | RudderStack Docs\n\nSync data from RudderStack to Azure Data Lake.\n\n* * *\n\n*     4 minute read  \n    \n\n[Azure Data Lake](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/solutions/data-lake/) is Microsoft’s secure and scalable data lake functionality that lets you store data of varying sizes and complexity and facilitates fast, cross-platform data processing and analytics.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Refer to the [Warehouse Schema](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/warehouse-destinations/warehouse-schema/) guide for more information on how the events are mapped to the tables in the Azure data lake.\n\n## Configuring Azure data lake destination in RudderStack\n\nTo send event data to Azure data lake, you first need to add it as a destination in RudderStack and connect it to your data source. Once the destination is enabled, events will automatically start flowing to Azure data lake via RudderStack.\n\nTo configure Azure data lake as a destination in RudderStack, follow these steps:\n\n1.  In your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), set up the data source. Then, select **Azure Data Lake** from the list of destinations.\n2.  Assign a name to your destination and then click **Next**.\n\n### Connection settings\n\n*   **Azure Blob Storage Container Name**: Enter the name of your Blob Storage container used to store the data before loading it into the data lake.\n*   **Prefix**: If specified, RudderStack will create a folder in the bucket with this prefix and push all data within that folder. For example, `https://<account_name>.blob.core.windows.net/<container_name>/<prefix>/`\n*   **Namespace**: If specified, all data for the destination will be pushed to `https://<account_name>.blob.core.windows.net/<bucketName>/<prefix>/rudder-datalake/<namespace>`. If you don’t specify a namespace in the settings, RudderStack sets it to the source name, by default.\n*   **Azure Blob Storage Account Name**: Enter your Azure Blob Storage account name.\n*   **Azure Blob Storage Account Key**: Enter your Blob Storage account key.\n*   **Use shared access signature (SAS) Tokens**: Enable this setting to grant limited access to your Azure Storage resources. When enabled, you can use a Shared Access Signatures (SAS) token instead of your storage account access key:\n\n[![Azure Blob Storage SAS token](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/dw-integrations/azure-sas-token.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/dw-integrations/azure-sas-token.webp)\n\n*   **Azure Blob Storage SAS**: Enter the generated SAS token.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> For more information on setting up your Azure Blob Storage account, refer to the [Azure Blob Storage](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/microsoft-azure-blob-storage/#setting-up-azure-blob-storage) guide.\n\n*   **Sync Frequency**: Specify how often RudderStack should sync the data to your Azure data lake.\n*   **Sync Starting At**: This optional setting lets you specify the particular time of the day (in UTC) when you want RudderStack to sync the data to the warehouse.\n\n### Advanced settings\n\n*   **Skip User Table**: Toggle on this setting to send events exclusively to the [`identifies`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/warehouse-destinations/warehouse-schema/#schema) table and skip the [`users`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/warehouse-destinations/warehouse-schema/#schema) table, eliminating the need for a merge operation on the `users` table.\n*   **Skip Tracks Table**: Toggle on this setting to skip sending events to the [`tracks`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/warehouse-destinations/warehouse-schema/#schema) table.\n\n## Finding your data in the Azure data lake\n\nRudderStack converts your events into Parquet files and dumps them into the configured Azure bucket. Before dumping the events, RudderStack groups the files by the event name based on the time (in UTC) they were received.\n\nThe folder structure is similar to the following format:\n\n`https://<account_name>.blob.core.windows.net/<prefix>/rudder-datalake/<namespace>/<tableName>/YYYY/MM/DD/HH`\n\nAs specified in the [Connection settings](#connection-settings) section above:\n\n*   `<prefix>` is the Azure prefix used while configuring the Azure data lake destination in RudderStack. If not specified, RudderStack will omit this value.\n*   `<namespace>` is the namespace specified in the destination settings. If not specified, RudderStack sets it to the source name.\n*   `<tableName>` is set to the event name.\n*   `YYYY`, `MM`, `DD`, and `HH` are replaced by the actual time values.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> A combination of the `YYYY`, `MM`, `DD`, and `HH` values represents the UTC time.\n\n### Use case\n\nSuppose that RudderStack tracks the following two events:\n\n| Event Name | Timestamp |\n| --- | --- |\n| Product Purchased | `\"2019-10-12T08:40:50.52Z\" UTC` |\n| Cart Viewed | `\"2019-11-12T09:34:50.52Z\" UTC` |\n\nRudderStack then converts these events into Parquet files and dumps them into the following folders:\n\n| Event Name | Folder Location |\n| --- | --- |\n| Product Purchased | `https://<account_name>.blob.core.windows.net/<prefix>/rudder-datalake/<namespace>/product_purchased/2019/10/12/08` |\n| Cart Viewed | `https://<account_name>.blob.core.windows.net/<prefix>/rudder-datalake/<namespace>/cart_viewed/2019/11/12/09` |\n\n## IPs to be allowlisted\n\nTo enable network access to RudderStack, allowlist the following RudderStack IPs depending on your region and [RudderStack Cloud plan](https://www.rudderstack.com/pricing):\n\n| Plan | Region |     |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|     | **<br><br>US<br><br>** | **<br><br>EU<br><br>** |\n| Free, Starter, and Growth | *   3.216.35.97<br>*   18.214.35.254<br>*   23.20.96.9<br>*   34.198.90.241<br>*   34.211.241.254<br>*   52.38.160.231<br>*   54.147.40.62 | *   3.123.104.182<br>*   3.125.132.33<br>*   18.198.90.215<br>*   18.196.167.201 |\n| Enterprise | *   3.216.35.97<br>*   34.198.90.241<br>*   44.236.60.231<br>*   54.147.40.62<br>*   100.20.239.77 | *   3.66.99.198<br>*   3.64.201.167<br>*   3.123.104.182<br>*   3.125.132.33 |\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> All the outbound traffic is routed through these RudderStack IPs.\n\n## FAQ\n\nFor a comprehensive FAQ list, refer to the [Warehouse FAQ](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/warehouse-destinations/faq/) guide.\n\nQuestions?

    "markdown": "# Azure Synapse | RudderStack Docs\n\nSync data from RudderStack to Azure Synapse.\n\n* * *\n\n*     5 minute read  \n    \n\n[Azure Synapse Analytics](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/services/synapse-analytics/) is an analytics service that combines data warehousing capabilities with Big Data analytics. If offers a unified data engineering platform to ingest, explore, manage, and serve your data for analytics and Business Intelligence.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Refer to the [Warehouse Schema](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/warehouse-destinations/warehouse-schema/) guide for more information on how the events are mapped to the tables in Azure Synapse.\n\nFind the open source code for this destination in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-transformer/tree/master/src/v0/destinations/azure_synapse).\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nBefore setting up Azure Synapse as a destination in RudderStack, make sure you have an Azure subscription and created the [Azure Synapse Workspace](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-in/azure/synapse-analytics/quickstart-create-workspace).\n\nAdditionally, you need to create a dedicated SQL pool in Azure Synapse. You can create it by following the [Azure Synapse documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/synapse-analytics/sql-data-warehouse/create-data-warehouse-portal).\n\nTo create a user-defined schema on your dedicated SQL pool, run the following SQL command on your pool:\n\n```\nCREATE SCHEMA <schema_name>;\n```\n\n## Configuring Azure Synapse destination in RudderStack\n\nTo send event data to Azure Synapse, you first need to add it as a destination in RudderStack and connect it to your data source. Once the destination is enabled, events will automatically start flowing to Azure Synapse via RudderStack.\n\nTo configure Azure Synapse as a destination in RudderStack, follow these steps:\n\n1.  In your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), set up the data source. Then, select **Azure Synapse** from the list of destinations.\n2.  Assign a name to your destination and then click **Next**.\n\n### Connection settings\n\n*   **Host**: The host name of your Azure Synapse service.\n*   **Database**: The database name in your Azure Synapse instance where the data will be sent.\n*   **User**: The name of the user with the required read/write access to the above database.\n*   **Password**: The password for the above user.\n*   **Port**: The port number associated with the Azure Synapse database instance.\n*   **Namespace**: Enter the name of the schema created in the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) section, where RudderStack will create all tables.\n*   **SSL Mode**: Choose the SSL mode through which RudderStack will connect to your Azure Synapse instance. RudderStack provides three options - **disable**, **true**, and **false**.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> For more information these SSL modes, refer to the [FAQ](#what-are-the-ssl-mode-options-provided-by-rudderstack) section below.\n\n*   **Sync Frequency**: Specify how often RudderStack should sync the data to your PostgreSQL database.\n*   **Sync Starting At**: This optional setting lets you specify the particular time of the day (in UTC) when you want RudderStack to sync the data to the warehouse.\n*   **Exclude Window**: This optional setting lets you set a time window when RudderStack will **not sync** the data to your database.\n\n### Advanced settings\n\n*   **Warehouse Append**: This setting is turned on by default - RudderStack appends your incoming Event Stream data to the existing data in your warehouse. Turning it off causes RudderStack to merge your incoming data into your warehouse to ensure 100% non-duplicate data.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> The append operation helps to achieve faster data syncs while reducing warehouse costs. However, note that it may increase the number of duplicates in the warehouse, especially if the existing data is older than two weeks. A common scenario where duplication might occur is when the SDKs retry sending events in case of failures.\n> \n> A merge strategy ensures deduplication but can lead to longer sync times and increased warehouse costs.\n\n*   **Skip User Table**: Toggle on this setting to send events exclusively to the [`identifies`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/warehouse-destinations/warehouse-schema/#schema) table and skip the [`users`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/warehouse-destinations/warehouse-schema/#schema) table, eliminating the need for a merge operation on the `users` table.\n*   **Skip Tracks Table**: Toggle on this setting to skip sending events to the [`tracks`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/warehouse-destinations/warehouse-schema/#schema) table.\n\n### Configuring the object storage\n\nRudderStack lets you configure the following object storage configuration settings while setting up your Azure Synapse destination:\n\n*   **Use RudderStack-managed object storage**: Enable this setting to use RudderStack-managed buckets for object storage.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> This option is applicable only for RudderStack-hosted data planes. For self-hosted data planes, you will have to specify your own object storage configuration settings.\n\n*   **Choose your storage provider**: If **Use RudderStack-managed object storage** is **disabled** in the dashboard, select the cloud provider for your object storage and enter the relevant settings:\n    \n    *   [Amazon S3 bucket storage settings](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/amazon-s3/#connection-settings)\n    *   [Azure Blob Storage settings](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/microsoft-azure-blob-storage/#setting-up-azure-blob-storage)\n    *   [Google Cloud Storage bucket settings](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/google-cloud-storage/#setting-up-google-cloud-storage)\n    *   [MinIO bucket storage settings](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/minio/#setting-up-minio)\n\nSee [How RudderStack stores data in an object storage platform](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/warehouse-destinations/faq/#how-does-rudderstack-store-data-in-an-object-storage-platform) for more information.\n\n## IPs to be allowlisted\n\nTo enable network access to RudderStack, allowlist the following RudderStack IPs depending on your region and [RudderStack Cloud plan](https://www.rudderstack.com/pricing):\n\n| Plan | Region |     |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|     | **<br><br>US<br><br>** | **<br><br>EU<br><br>** |\n| Free, Starter, and Growth | *   3.216.35.97<br>*   18.214.35.254<br>*   23.20.96.9<br>*   34.198.90.241<br>*   34.211.241.254<br>*   52.38.160.231<br>*   54.147.40.62 | *   3.123.104.182<br>*   3.125.132.33<br>*   18.198.90.215<br>*   18.196.167.201 |\n| Enterprise | *   3.216.35.97<br>*   34.198.90.241<br>*   44.236.60.231<br>*   54.147.40.62<br>*   100.20.239.77 | *   3.66.99.198<br>*   3.64.201.167<br>*   3.123.104.182<br>*   3.125.132.33 |\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> All the outbound traffic is routed through these RudderStack IPs.\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### How are reserved words handled by RudderStack?\n\nThere are some limitations when it comes to using [reserved words](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/language-elements/reserved-keywords-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver15) in a schema, table, or column names. If such words are used as event names, traits or properties, they will be prefixed with a `_` when RudderStack creates tables or columns for them in your schema.\n\nAlso, note that integers are not allowed at the start of the schema or table name. Hence, RudderStack prefixes such schema, column, or table names with a `_`.\n\nFor instance, `'25dollarpurchase'` will be changed by RudderStack to `'_25dollarpurchase`'.\n\n#### How does RudderStack handle cases when loading the data into Azure Synapse?\n\nRudderStack converts the event keys into lower case before exporting the data into Azure Synapse, so that it does not create two tables if the event name has two different cases.\n\n#### What are the SSL mode options provided by RudderStack?\n\nWhile setting up the Azure Synapse destination, RudderStack provides the following three SSL options:\n\n*   **disable**: The data sent from RudderStack to your database is not encrypted.\n*   **false**: The data sent from RudderStack to your database is not encrypted beyond the login packet.\n*   **true**: The data sent from RudderStack to your database is encrypted.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> For a more comprehensive FAQ list, refer to the [Warehouse FAQ](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/warehouse-destinations/faq/) guide.\n\nQuestions?

It offers features like live chat, call center software capabilities, and a smart knowledge base for your executives to help them resolve customers’ queries and concerns.\n\nFind the open source code for this destination in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-transformer/tree/master/src/v0/destinations/zendesk).\n\n## Getting started\n\nRudderStack supports sending events to Zendesk via the following [connection modes](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/):\n\n| Connection Mode | Web | Mobile | Server |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Device mode** | \\-  | \\-  | \\-  |\n| **Cloud mode** | **Supported** | **Supported** | **Supported** |\n\nOnce you have confirmed that the source platform supports sending events to Zendesk, follow these steps:\n\n1.  From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add the source. Then, from the list of destinations, select **Zendesk**.\n2.  Assign a name to your destination and click **Continue**.\n\n### Connection settings\n\nTo successfully configure Zendesk as a destination, you need to configure the following settings:\n\n*   **Email**: Enter the email address used to log in to your Zendesk account.\n*   **API Token**: Enter the Zendesk API token used to authenticate the integration. To generate a new API token, see the [Zendesk support article](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/226022787-Generating-a-new-API-token-).\n*   **Zendesk Subdomain**: Enter your Zendesk subdomain **excluding** `.zendesk.com`.\n*   **Source Name**: Enter the events source name. If not specified, RudderStack sets this field to `Rudder` by default.\n*   **Create users as verified**: Enable this setting to create verified users in Zendesk. When enabled, RudderStack sends `verified` as `true` in the event and Zendesk skips the email verification for these users.\n*   **Send Group calls without User ID**: Enable this setting if you do not want to associate a particular user with a group. When enabled, RudderStack creates or updates a group only if `userId` is **not** present in the event.\n*   **Enable Removing Users from Organizations**: Enable this setting to remove users from an organization via the `identify` call. For more information on this setting, see [Removing users from an organization](#removing-users-from-an-organization) section below.\n*   **Update user’s primary email**: Enable this setting to set the email present in the event as the user’s primary email in Zendesk, replacing the previously-set primary email. For more information on this setting, see [Updating user’s primary email in Zendesk](#updating-users-primary-email-in-zendesk) section below.\n*   **OneTrust Cookie Categories**: This setting lets you associate [OneTrust](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/data-governance/consent-management/onetrust/javascript/) cookie consent groups to Zendesk.\n\n## Identify\n\nYou can use the [`identify`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/identify/) call to create or update a user in Zendesk.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> It is highly recommended to include the user’s `email` in the `identify` call as RudderStack uses this field to create or update a user in Zendesk.\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify(\"1hKOmRA4GRlm\", {\n  name: \"Alex Keener\",\n  email: \"alex@example.com\",\n  country: \"USA\",\n});\n```\n\nRudderStack persists the user details from the `identify` call for all subsequent calls made to Zendesk.\n\n### Supported mapping\n\nRudderStack maps the following event properties to the standard Zendesk user attributes:\n\n| **RudderStack property** | **Zendesk attribute** |\n| --- | --- |\n| `name`  <br>Required | `name` |\n| `email`  <br>Optional, but recommended | `email` |\n| `organizationId` / `company.id` | `organization_id` |\n| `timezone` | `time_zone` |\n| `phone` | `phone` |\n| `userId` | `user_id` |\n| `userId` | `external_id` |\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack creates a new custom field in Zendesk for any other unmapped attributes.\n\n### Removing users from an organization\n\nEnable the **Enable Removing Users from Organizations** setting in the dashboard to use this feature.\n\nTo remove a user from an organization, the following fields must be present in the `identify` [`traits`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/identify/#sample-payload):\n\n*   `company.id`\n*   `company.remove` (set to `true`)\n\nA sample `identify` call for this action is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify(\"1hKOmRA4GRlm\",{\n  name: \"Alex Keener\",\n  email: \"alex@example.com\",\n  country: \"USA\",\n  company:{\n    id: 900001329943,\n    remove: true\n  }\n});\n```\n\nThe above `identify` call updates the user (if they exist) as well as removes them from the organization associated with the ID `900001329943`.\n\nRudderStack assumes a valid Zendesk `organization_id` in the `company.id` field. Then, it finds the organization corresponding to that ID and removes the user.\n\n### Updating user’s primary email in Zendesk\n\nTo set the email present in the event as the user’s primary email in Zendesk, enable the **Update user’s primary email** dashboard setting and pass the `email` trait in the `identify` call:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify(\"1hKOmRA4GRlm\", {\n  name: \"Alex Keener\",\n  email: \"alex@example.com\",\n  country: \"USA\",\n});\n```\n\nWhen you send the above event, Zendesk sets `alex@example.com` as the user’s primary email.\n\nIf the **Update user’s primary email** dashboard setting is disabled, RudderStack sets the `email` present in the `identify` traits as the user’s secondary email in Zendesk, **if** any primary mail already exists.\n\n## Track\n\nThe [`track`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/track/) call lets you record the user actions along with any associated properties and send this information to Zendesk.\n\nYou need to first set the `userId` by calling `identify` before sending any `track` events to Zendesk.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Zendesk expects a `userId` for every `track` call.\n\nA sample `track` call is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\"Order Completed\", {\n  userId: \"1hKOmRA4GRlm\"\n  currency: \"USD\",\n  revenue: 77,\n  value: 99.99,\n});\n```\n\n## Group\n\nYou can use the [`group`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/group/) call to create or update an organization in Zendesk. RudderStack uses the `groupId` to do this.\n\nA sample `group` call is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.group(\"group01\", {\n  name: \"Softworks\",\n  country: \"UK\",\n  group_plan: \"trial\",\n});\n```\n\n### Associating user to an organization\n\nYou can also use the `group` call to associate a particular user to an organization. To do so, disable the **Send Group Calls without User ID** dashboard setting in RudderStack and pass the `userId` via the [`identify`](#identify) call before sending any `group` calls to Zendesk.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack assumes that an `identify` call (containing the `userId`) is made before any `group` call.\n\nIf you do not want to associate a particular user with a group, enable the **Send Group Calls without User ID** dashboard setting. If this setting is enabled, the group will be created or updated only if `userId` is **not** present in the event.\n\n### Standard mapping\n\nRudderStack maps the following **optional** `group` traits to the standard Zendesk organization attributes:\n\n| **RudderStack** | **Zendesk** |\n| --- | --- |\n| `name` | `name` |\n| `domainNames` | `domain_names` |\n| `tags` | `tags` |\n| `groupId` | `external_id` |\n| `url` | `url` |\n| `deleted` | `deleted` |\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack creates a new custom field in Zendesk for any other unmapped attributes.\n\n### How RudderStack does the user-organization association\n\n*   If both `userId` and `groupId` are present in the `group` event, then RudderStack first finds the user by looking for the `email` field present in the [`context.traits`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/common-fields/#contextual-fields) object.\n    \n    *   If `email` is present, then RudderStack associates the user with the `organizationId` and sends all user information for this call.\n    *   If `email` is absent, RudderStack creates the user. It will then find the organization associated with the `groupId` present in the payload.\n*   If `groupId` is absent in the event payload, RudderStack creates a new organization in Zendesk and then does the association.\n    \n\nThe above discussion can be summarized as follows:\n\n| `email` present? | `groupId` present? | Description | Expected behavior |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| No  | No  | User and the organization do not exist in Zendesk. | RudderStack creates a new user and organization and associates both. |\n| Yes | No  | User already exists in Zendesk but not the organization. | RudderStack creates a new organization and associates the existing user information with it. |\n| No  | Yes | Organization already exists in Zendesk but not the user. | RudderStack creates a new user and associates them with the organization. |\n| Yes | Yes | Both the user and the organization exist in Zendesk. | RudderStack does the user-organization association. |\n\nQuestions?

    "markdown": "# Databricks Delta Lake | RudderStack Docs\n\nSync data from RudderStack to Databricks Delta Lake.\n\n* * *\n\n*     14 minute read  \n    \n\n[Delta Lake](https://databricks.com/product/delta-lake-on-databricks) is a popular data lake used for both streaming and batch operations. It lets you store structured, unstructured, and semi-structured data securely and reliably.\n\nFind the open source code for this destination in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-transformer/tree/master/src/v0/destinations/deltalake).\n\n## Configuring Delta Lake destination in RudderStack\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> Before configuring Delta Lake as a destination in RudderStack, it is highly recommended to go through the following sections to obtain the necessary configuration settings. These sections also contain the steps to grant RudderStack and Databricks the necessary permissions to your preferred storage bucket.\n> \n> *   [Granting RudderStack access to your storage bucket](#granting-rudderstack-access-to-your-storage-bucket)\n> *   [Granting Databricks access to your storage bucket](#granting-databricks-access-to-your-staging-bucket)\n> *   [Creating a new Databricks cluster](#creating-a-new-databricks-cluster)\n> *   [Generating the Databricks access token](#generating-the-databricks-access-token)\n> *   [Obtaining the JDBC/ODBC configuration](#obtaining-the-jdbcodbc-configuration)\n\nTo send event data to Delta Lake, you first need to add it as a destination in RudderStack and connect it to your data source. Once the destination is enabled, events will automatically start flowing to Delta Lake via RudderStack.\n\nTo configure Delta Lake as a destination in RudderStack, follow these steps:\n\n1.  In your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), set up the data source. Then, select **Databricks Delta Lake** from the list of destinations.\n2.  Assign a name to your destination and then click **Next**.\n\n### Connection settings\n\n*   **Host**: Enter your server hostname from the Databricks dashboard.\n*   **Port**: Enter the port number.\n*   **HTTP Path**: Enter the cluster’s HTTP path.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> For more information on obtaining the server hostname, port, and the cluster’s HTTP path, refer to the [Obtaining the JDBC/ODBC configuration](#obtaining-the-jdbcodbc-configuration) section below.\n\n*   **Personal Access Token**: Enter your Databricks access token. For more information on generating the access token, refer to the [Generating the Databricks access token](#generating-the-databricks-access-token) section below.\n*   **Enable delta tables creation in an external location**: Enable this setting to specify the external location to create the delta tables. You can specify the external location in the **External delta table location** setting. When disabled, RudderStack creates the delta tables at a default storage location for the non-external Apache Hive tables.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> If you **have not** configured a [Unity catalog](https://docs.databricks.com/data-governance/unity-catalog/index.html), you can access the delta tables at `{path_to_table}/{schema}/{table}`.\n> \n> If you **have** configured a Unity catalog, follow these steps:\n> \n> 1.  Create an external location by following this [Databricks documentation](https://docs.databricks.com/data-governance/unity-catalog/manage-external-locations-and-credentials.html#manage-external-locations). Your location will look something like `s3://{bucket_path}/{external_location}`.\n> 2.  Specify the absolute location in the **External delta table location** setting. It will look something like `s3://{bucket_path}/{external_location}/{path_to_table}/{schema}/{table}`.\n\n*   **Catalog**: If you have configured a [Unity catalog](https://docs.databricks.com/data-governance/unity-catalog/index.html), enter the catalog name where your data assets are organized. For more information on creating a Unity Catalog, refer to the [Databricks documentation](https://docs.databricks.com/data-governance/unity-catalog/create-catalogs.html).\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> If you do not specify the catalog name, RudderStack uses the default catalog configured for your workspace.\n\n*   **Namespace**: Enter the the name of the schema where RudderStack will create the tables. If you don’t specify a namespace in the dashboard settings, RudderStack will set it to the source name, by default.\n*   **Sync Frequency**: Specify how often RudderStack should sync the data to your Delta Lake instance.\n*   **Sync Starting At**: This optional setting lets you specify the particular time of the day (in UTC) when you want RudderStack to sync the data to the Delta Lake instance.\n*   **Exclude Window**: This optional setting lets you specify the time window (in UTC) when RudderStack will **skip** the data sync.\n*   **Object Storage Configuration**: Use this setting to specify your object storage.\n    *   **Use RudderStack managed object storage**: Enable this setting to use RudderStack-managed buckets for object storage. Note that this option is applicable only for RudderStack-hosted data planes. For self-hosted data planes, you need to specify your own object storage configuration settings.\n    *   **Choose your storage provider**: If **Use RudderStack managed object storage** is disabled, you can select any one of the following platforms for storing your staging files:\n        *   [Amazon S3 bucket storage settings](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/amazon-s3/#connection-settings)\n        *   [Azure Blob Storage settings](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/microsoft-azure-blob-storage/#setting-up-azure-blob-storage)\n        *   [Google Cloud Storage bucket settings](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/google-cloud-storage/#setting-up-google-cloud-storage)\n\nSee [How RudderStack stores data in an object storage platform](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/warehouse-destinations/faq/#how-does-rudderstack-store-data-in-an-object-storage-platform) for more information.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> If you select S3 as your storage provider, RudderStack provides the option to specify your IAM role ARN or the AWS access key ID/secret access key by enabling the **Use STS Tokens to copy staging files** setting. For more information, refer to the [Amazon S3 storage bucket settings](#case-2-use-sts-token-to-copy-staging-files-is-enabled-in-the-dashboard) section below.\n\n### Advanced settings\n\n*   **Warehouse Append**: This setting is turned on by default - RudderStack appends your incoming Event Stream data to the existing data in your warehouse. Turning it off causes RudderStack to merge your incoming data into your warehouse to ensure 100% non-duplicate data.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> The append operation helps to achieve faster data syncs while reducing warehouse costs. However, note that it may increase the number of duplicates in the warehouse, especially if the existing data is older than two weeks. A common scenario where duplication might occur is when the SDKs retry sending events in case of failures.\n> \n> A merge strategy ensures deduplication but can lead to longer sync times and increased warehouse costs.\n\n*   **Skip User Table**: Toggle on this setting to send events exclusively to the [`identifies`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/warehouse-destinations/warehouse-schema/#schema) table and skip the [`users`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/warehouse-destinations/warehouse-schema/#schema) table, eliminating the need for a merge operation on the `users` table.\n*   **Skip Tracks Table**: Toggle on this setting to skip sending events to the [`tracks`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/warehouse-destinations/warehouse-schema/#schema) table.\n\n## Granting RudderStack access to your storage bucket\n\nThis section contains the steps to edit your bucket policy to grant RudderStack the necessary permissions, depending on your preferred cloud platform.\n\n### Amazon S3\n\nFollow these steps to grant RudderStack access to your S3 bucket based on the following two cases:\n\n#### Case 1: Use STS Token to copy staging files is disabled in the dashboard\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> Follow the steps listed in this section if the **Use STS Token to copy staging files** option is disabled, that is, you **don’t want to specify** the AWS credentials while configuring your Delta Lake destination.\n\n#### For RudderStack Cloud\n\nIf you are using RudderStack Cloud, edit your bucket policy using the following JSON:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n  \"Statement\": [{\n    \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n    \"Principal\": {\n      \"AWS\": \"arn:aws:iam::422074288268:user/s3-copy\"\n    },\n    \"Action\": [\n      \"s3:GetObject\",\n      \"s3:PutObject\",\n      \"s3:PutObjectAcl\",\n      \"s3:ListBucket\"\n    ],\n    \"Resource\": [\n      \"arn:aws:s3:::YOUR_BUCKET_NAME/*\",\n      \"arn:aws:s3:::YOUR_BUCKET_NAME\"\n    ]\n  }]\n}\n```\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Make sure you replace `YOUR_BUCKET_NAME` with the name of your S3 bucket.\n\n#### For self-hosted RudderStack\n\nIf you are [self-hosting RudderStack](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/get-started/rudderstack-open-source/), follow these steps:\n\n1.  Create an IAM policy with the following JSON:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n  \"Statement\": [{\n    \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n    \"Action\": \"*\",\n    \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:s3:::*\"\n  }]\n}\n```\n\n2.  Then, create an [IAM user with programmatic access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html). Attach the above IAM policy to this user.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Copy the ARN of this newly-created user. This is required in the next step.\n\n3.  Next, edit your bucket policy with the following JSON to allow RudderStack to write to your S3 bucket.\n\n```\n{\n  \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n  \"Statement\": [{\n    \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n    \"Principal\": {\n      \"AWS\": \"arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT_ID:user/USER_ARN\"\n    },\n    \"Action\": [\n      \"s3:GetObject\",\n      \"s3:PutObject\",\n      \"s3:PutObjectAcl\",\n      \"s3:ListBucket\"\n    ],\n    \"Resource\": [\n      \"arn:aws:s3:::YOUR_BUCKET_NAME/*\",\n      \"arn:aws:s3:::YOUR_BUCKET_NAME\"\n    ]\n  }]\n}\n```\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Make sure you replace `USER_ARN` with the ARN copied in the previous step. Also, replace `ACCOUNT_ID` with your AWS account ID and `YOUR_BUCKET_NAME` with the name of your S3 bucket.\n\n4.  Finally, add the programmatic access credentials to the `env` file present in your RudderStack installation:\n\n```\nRUDDER_AWS_S3_COPY_USER_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<user_access_key>\nRUDDER_AWS_S3_COPY_USER_ACCESS_KEY=<user_access_key_secret>\n```\n\n#### Case 2: Use STS Token to copy staging files is enabled in the dashboard\n\nIn this case, provide the configuration directly while setting up the Delta Lake destination in RudderStack:\n\n[![S3 settings in RudderStack dashboard](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/dw-integrations/delta-lake-connection-settings-3.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/dw-integrations/delta-lake-connection-settings-3.webp)\n\n*   **Role-based Authentication**: Enable this setting to use the RudderStack IAM role for authentication. For more information on creating an AWS IAM role for RudderStack, refer to [this guide](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/aws-iam-role-for-rudderstack/#creating-a-rudderstack-iam-role).\n    *   **IAM Role ARN**: Enter the ARN of the IAM role.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> It is highly recommended to enable this setting as the access keys-based authentication method is now deprecated.\n\nIf **Role-based Authentication** is disabled, you need to enter the **AWS Access Key ID** and **AWS Secret Access Key** to authorize RudderStack to write to your S3 bucket.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> In both the role-based and access key-based authentication methods, you need to set a policy specifying the required permissions for RudderStack to write to your intermediary S3 bucket. Refer to the [S3 permissions for warehouse destinations](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/amazon-s3/#s3-permissions-for-warehouse-destinations) section for more information.\n\n### Google Cloud Storage\n\nYou can provide the necessary GCS bucket configuration while setting up the Delta Lake destination in RudderStack. For more information, refer to the [Google Cloud Storage bucket settings](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/google-cloud-storage/#setting-up-google-cloud-storage).\n\n### Azure Blob Storage\n\nYou can provide the necessary Blob Storage container configuration while setting up the Delta Lake destination in RudderStack. For more information, refer to the [Azure Blob Storage settings](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/microsoft-azure-blob-storage/#setting-up-azure-blob-storage).\n\n## Granting Databricks access to your staging bucket\n\nThis section contains the steps to grant Databricks the necessary permissions to access your staging bucket, depending on your preferred cloud platform.\n\n### Amazon S3\n\nFollow these steps to grant Databricks access to your S3 bucket depending on your case:\n\n#### Case 1: Use STS Token to copy staging files is disabled in the dashboard\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> Follow the steps listed in this section if the **Use STS Token to copy staging files** option is disabled, i.e. you **don’t want to specify** the AWS access key and secret access key while configuring your Delta Lake destination.\n\nIn this case, you will be required to configure your AWS account to [create an instance profile](https://docs.databricks.com/administration-guide/cloud-configurations/aws/instance-profiles.html) which will then be attached with your Databricks cluster.\n\nFollow these steps in the exact order:\n\n1.  [Create an instance profile to access the S3 bucket](https://docs.databricks.com/administration-guide/cloud-configurations/aws/instance-profiles.html#step-1-create-an-instance-profile-to-access-an-s3-bucket).\n2.  [Create a bucket policy for the target S3 bucket](https://docs.databricks.com/administration-guide/cloud-configurations/aws/instance-profiles.html#step-2-create-a-bucket-policy-for-the-target-s3-bucket).\n3.

Is there a possibility of data loss?\n\nIf a warehouse destination is down or unavailable, RudderStack will continue to retry sending events (on an exponential backoff basis, for up to 3 hours).\n\nRudderStack stores the syncs as staging files and retries sending them at a later time when the cluster is up again. This allows for a successful delivery without any missing data.\n\nAfter retrying for up to 3 hours, RudderStack marks the syncs as aborted. Once the service is up and running again, you can go to the [Syncs](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/dashboard-guides/overview/#syncs) tab in the RudderStack dashboard and retry sending the data.\n\n#### Does RudderStack automatically spin the Databricks cluster/SQL endpoint every time it needs to write?\n\nNo, RudderStack does not spin the Databricks cluster or the SQL endpoint on its own every time it needs to write to the cluster.\n\nDatabricks itself starts up the cluster/endpoint when the connection is established. You just need to configure the [automatic termination](https://docs.databricks.com/clusters/clusters-manage.html#automatic-termination-1) settings in the **Autopilot Options** on the cluster creation page:\n\n[![Databricks autopilot options](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/dw-integrations/databricks-autopilot-options.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/dw-integrations/databricks-autopilot-options.webp)\n\n#### How does RudderStack handle the reserved words in a column, table, or schema?\n\nThere are some limitations when it comes to using reserved words as a schema, table, or column name. If such words are used in event names, traits or properties, they will be prefixed with a `_` when RudderStack creates tables or columns for them in your schema.\n\nAlso, integers are **not** allowed at the start of a schema or table name. Hence, such schema, column, or table names will be prefixed with a `_`. For example, `'25dollarpurchase'` will be changed to `'_25dollarpurchase'`.\n\n#### How can I modify an existing table to a partitioned table?\n\nTo modify an existing table to a partitioned table, follow these steps:\n\n1.  Set an exclusion window (using the **Exclude window** connection setting) so that RudderStack does not process any data while performing the below changes.\n2.  Make the required changes in connection settings of the configured Delta Lake destination.\n3.  Run the following queries in the Databricks Cluster/SQL endpoints to:\n    *   Rename the existing table with `_temp` suffix.\n    *   Add `event_date` column to the `_temp` table.\n    *   Backfill the data into original table.\n\n```\nALTER TABLE x RENAME TO x_temp;\nALTER TABLE x_temp ADD COLUMN TO event_date DATE;\nINSERT INTO x SELECT * FROM x_temp;\n```\n\n#### How can I convert an existing managed or unmanaged table at a location to an unmanaged table at a new location?\n\n1.  Set an exclusion window (using the **Exclude window** connection setting) so that RudderStack does not process any data while performing the below changes.\n2.  Run the following queries in the Databricks Cluster/SQL endpoints to:\n    *   Create a temporary table using the new location.\n    *   Drop the temporary table.\n    *   Drop the original table.\n\n```\nCREATE OR REPLACE TABLE namespace.x_temp DEEP CLONE namespace.x LOCATION '/path/to/new/location/namespace/x';\n// where namespace represents the namespace attached to the destination in RudderStack.\n// where x represents the original table created by RudderStack.\n\nDROP TABLE namespace.x_temp;\nDROP TABLE namespace.x;\n```\n\n3.  Enable the **Enable delta tables creation in an external location** setting in RudderStack dashboard and update the location.\n4.  Remove the exclusion window and make the required changes in connection settings of the configured Delta Lake destination.\n\nRudderStack will create the table again during the subsequent data syncs.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n\n#### How do I convert an existing unmanaged table at a specific location to a managed table (at default location)?\n\n1.  Set an exclusion window (using the **Exclude window** connection setting) so that RudderStack does not process anything while performing the below changes.\n2.  Run the following queries in the Databricks Cluster/SQL Endpoints to:\n    *   Create a temporary table.\n    *   Drop original table.\n    *   Rename temporary table to original table.\n\n```\nCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS namespace.x_temp DEEP CLONE namespace.x;\n// where namespace represents the namespace attached to the destination in RudderStack.\n// where x represents the original table created by RudderStack.\n\nDROP TABLE namespace.x;\nALTER TABLE namespace.x_temp RENAME TO namespace.x;\n```\n\n3.  Remove the exclusion window and make sure the **Enable delta tables creation in an external location** setting is disabled in the RudderStack dashboard.\n\nRudderStack will create the table again during the subsequent data syncs.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> For a more comprehensive FAQ list, refer to the [Warehouse FAQ](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/warehouse-destinations/faq/) guide.\n\nQuestions?

    "markdown": "# ClickHouse destination | RudderStack Docs\n\nSync data from RudderStack to ClickHouse.\n\n* * *\n\n*     5 minute read  \n    \n\n[ClickHouse](https://clickhouse.tech/) is an open-source, column-oriented database management system mainly used for online analytical processing (OLAP). It is fast, and allows for real-time analysis of your data.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Refer to the [Warehouse Schema](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/warehouse-destinations/warehouse-schema/) guide for more information on how the events are mapped to the tables in ClickHouse.\n\n## Setting user permissions in ClickHouse\n\nMake sure your ClickHouse user has read access to `system.columns` table for fetching the table schemas.\n\nYou also to need to set `date_time_input_format` to `best_effort` for ClickHouse to parse all [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) date and time formats:\n\n```\nset date_time_input_format = 'best_effort';\n```\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack uses the `UInt8` datatype to set Boolean values and map `UInt8`to Boolean internally. So when a schema is fetched from ClickHouse, RudderStack treats `UInt8` as Boolean.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> If you are creating tables in the same database where RudderStack loads, it is highly recommend to not use `UInt8`as a datatype except for Boolean values (0,1).\n\n## Configuring ClickHouse in RudderStack\n\nTo send event data to ClickHouse, you first need to add it as a destination in RudderStack and connect it to your data source. Once the destination is enabled, events will automatically start flowing to ClickHouse via RudderStack.\n\nTo configure ClickHouse as a destination in RudderStack, follow these steps:\n\n1.  In your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), set up the data source. Then, select **ClickHouse** from the list of destinations.\n2.  Assign a name to your destination and then click **Next**.\n\n### Connection Settings\n\n*   **Host**: The host name of your ClickHouse database.\n*   **Port**: The TCP port of your ClickHouse host. If you want the connection to be secure, use the secure TCP port `9440`. Refer to the [ClickHouse guide](https://clickhouse.tech/docs/en/operations/server-configuration-parameters/settings/#server_configuration_parameters-tcp_port) for more information.\n*   **Database**: The database name in your ClickHouse instance where the data gets loaded.\n*   **Cluster**: The name of your ClickHouse cluster. **If you are running a single host ClickHouse cluster, leave this field blank.**\n*   **User**: The name of the user with the required read/write access to the above database.\n*   **Password**: The password for the above user.\n*   **Secure**: Enable this setting to establish a secure connection.\n*   **Sync Frequency**: Specify how often RudderStack should sync the data to your ClickHouse database.\n*   **Sync Starting At**: This optional setting lets you specify the particular time of the day (in UTC) when you want RudderStack to sync the data to the warehouse.\n*   **Exclude Window**: This optional setting lets you set a time window when RudderStack will **not sync** the data to your database.\n\n### Advanced settings\n\n*   **Warehouse Append**: This setting is turned on by default - RudderStack appends your incoming Event Stream data to the existing data in your warehouse. Turning it off causes RudderStack to merge your incoming data into your warehouse to ensure 100% non-duplicate data.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> The append operation helps to achieve faster data syncs while reducing warehouse costs. However, note that it may increase the number of duplicates in the warehouse, especially if the existing data is older than two weeks. A common scenario where duplication might occur is when the SDKs retry sending events in case of failures.\n> \n> A merge strategy ensures deduplication but can lead to longer sync times and increased warehouse costs.\n\n*   **Skip User Table**: Toggle on this setting to send events exclusively to the [`identifies`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/warehouse-destinations/warehouse-schema/#schema) table and skip the [`users`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/warehouse-destinations/warehouse-schema/#schema) table, eliminating the need for a merge operation on the `users` table.\n*   **Skip Tracks Table**: Toggle on this setting to skip sending events to the [`tracks`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/warehouse-destinations/warehouse-schema/#schema) table.\n\n### Configuring the object storage\n\nRudderStack lets you configure the following object storage configuration settings while setting up your ClickHouse destination:\n\n*   **Use RudderStack-managed object storage**: Enable this setting to use RudderStack-managed buckets for object storage.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> This option is applicable only for RudderStack-hosted data planes. For [self-hosted data planes](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/get-started/rudderstack-open-source/data-plane-setup/), you will have to specify your own object storage configuration settings.\n\n*   **Choose your storage provider**: If **Use RudderStack-managed object storage** is **disabled** in the dashboard, select the cloud provider for your object storage and enter the relevant settings:\n    \n    *   [Amazon S3 bucket storage settings](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/amazon-s3/#connection-settings)\n    *   [Azure Blob Storage settings](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/microsoft-azure-blob-storage/#setting-up-azure-blob-storage)\n    *   [Google Cloud Storage bucket settings](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/google-cloud-storage/#setting-up-google-cloud-storage)\n    *   [MinIO bucket storage settings](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/minio/#setting-up-minio)\n\nSee [How RudderStack stores data in an object storage platform](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/warehouse-destinations/faq/#how-does-rudderstack-store-data-in-an-object-storage-platform) for more information.\n\n## IPs to be allowlisted\n\nTo enable network access to RudderStack, allowlist the following RudderStack IPs depending on your region and [RudderStack Cloud plan](https://www.rudderstack.com/pricing):\n\n| Plan | Region |     |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|     | **<br><br>US<br><br>** | **<br><br>EU<br><br>** |\n| Free, Starter, and Growth | *   3.216.35.97<br>*   18.214.35.254<br>*   23.20.96.9<br>*   34.198.90.241<br>*   34.211.241.254<br>*   52.38.160.231<br>*   54.147.40.62 | *   3.123.104.182<br>*   3.125.132.33<br>*   18.198.90.215<br>*   18.196.167.201 |\n| Enterprise | *   3.216.35.97<br>*   34.198.90.241<br>*   44.236.60.231<br>*   54.147.40.62<br>*   100.20.239.77 | *   3.66.99.198<br>*   3.64.201.167<br>*   3.123.104.182<br>*   3.125.132.33 |\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> All the outbound traffic is routed through these RudderStack IPs.\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### How does RudderStack de-duplicate the events that are loaded into the warehouse?\n\nRudderStack creates tables with the engine `ReplacingMergeTree order by (received_at, id)` and column `dataType` as `Nullable(dataType)`.[`ReplacingMergeTree`](https://clickhouse.tech/docs/en/engines/table-engines/mergetree-family/replacingmergetree/) replaces the latest event which has the same `received_at, id` while merging. Note that `Nullable` is not applicable for `sortKeys`.\n\n#### How does RudderStack merge the user properties in the user’s table?\n\nFor the user’s table, RudderStack creates a table with an engine `AggregatingMergeTree` ordered by `id` and a column `dataType` as `SimpleAggregateFunction(anyLast, Nullable(dataType))`. Merging the columns with the same`id`picks the last value which is not null. Note that `Nullable` is not applicable for `sortKeys`.\n\n#### How does RudderStack handle cases when loading data into ClickHouse?\n\nRudderStack converts the event keys into the lower case before exporting the data into ClickHouse. This is so that it does not create two tables in case the event name has two different cases.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> For a more comprehensive FAQ list, refer to the [Warehouse FAQ](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/warehouse-destinations/faq/) guide.\n\nQuestions?

It allows you to handle large analytical workloads with best-in-class performance, speed, and efficiency. With Redshift, you don’t have to worry about the scale of your data or the cost of running queries on them.\n\nFind the open source code for this destination in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-transformer/tree/master/src/v0/destinations/rs).\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Refer to the [Warehouse Schema](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/warehouse-destinations/warehouse-schema/) guide for more information on how the events are mapped to the tables in Redshift.\n\n## Setting up a Redshift cluster\n\nBefore adding Redshift as a destination in RudderStack, it is recommended that you create a new Redshift cluster depending on the type of instance needed.\n\nThe following sections contain step-by-step instructions on setting up a Redshift cluster.\n\n### Choosing the Redshift instance type\n\nAmazon Redshift provides two types of clusters: **Dense Compute** and **Dense Storage** clusters.\n\n*   **Dense Compute** clusters maximize CPU usage, resulting in an increased query performance. However, there is a trade-off with respect to the storage.\n*   **Dense Storage** clusters maximize storage for customers with hundreds of millions of rows of data. However, there is a trade-off in the CPU usage, resulting in a lower query performance.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Refer to this [Redshift guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/working-with-clusters.html#working-with-clusters-overview) for more information on the cluster and node types in Redshift.\n\n### Creating a new Redshift cluster\n\nFollow the steps below to create a new Redshift cluster:\n\n1.  Open the Redshift Console as shown:\n\n[![Redshift Console](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/1%20%283%29.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/1%20%283%29.webp)\n\nRedshift Console\n\n2.

Finish creating the cluster by allowing the default options for **Additional Configurations**.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> As a part of this setup, you also need to edit the VPC network and configure the security settings. More information on these aspects in available in the following sections.\n\nWith the Redshift cluster now created and ready to use, the next sections cover the necessary steps to set up the necessary user permissions and set up Redshift as a destination in RudderStack.\n\n## Setting user permissions in Redshift\n\nThis section contains the steps to create a new user to access the Redshift cluster and create temporary tables in it.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> The username and password provided earlier while creating the Redshift cluster should be strictly used for administration purposes. RudderStack will create a different user to enable access to Redshift. This also helps RudderStack keep the queries separate as well as maintain an audit log.\n\n1.  Click the **Editor** option in the left pane. You can run the queries to create a new user to access the Redshift cluster in the **Query editor**:\n\n[![Query editor](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/6%20%281%29.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/6%20%281%29.webp)\n\n2.

Go to EC2 from the services on your AWS console:\n\n[![Go to EC2](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/7%20%283%29.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/7%20%283%29.webp)\n\n2.  Go to **Security Groups** under **Network & Security**, followed by **Create Security Group**.\n\n[![Create Security Group](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/8%20%281%29%20%281%29.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/8%20%281%29%20%281%29.webp)\n\n3.  Enter the details of the security group. The **Security group name** will be used to select the group later.\n\n[![Security group name](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/9%20%281%29.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/9%20%281%29.webp)\n\n4.  Add an **Inbound rule** with IPs listed above, and enter the Redshift port as `5439` in the **Port range** field:\n\n[![Port range](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/10.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/10.webp)\n\n5.  Next, go to the Redshift cluster and select **Properties**, where you can modify the network and security rules of the cluster.\n\n[![Properties](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/11.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/11.webp)\n\n6.  Edit the **Network and security** option and choose the VPC security group that you selected earlier.\n\n[![Network and security](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/12.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/12.webp)\n\n7.  Finally, click **Modify cluster** to finish the **Network and Security** setup.\n\n[![Modify cluster](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/13.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/13.webp)\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> The Redshift cluster needs to be publicly accessible. Refer to this [Redshift guide](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/redshift-cluster-private-public/) for more information on how to set this property.\n\n## Configuring Redshift destination in RudderStack\n\nTo send event data to Redshift, you first need to add it as a destination in RudderStack and connect it to your data source. Once the destination is enabled, events will automatically start flowing to Redshift via RudderStack.\n\nTo configure Redshift as a destination in RudderStack, follow these steps:\n\n1.  In your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), set up the data source. Then, select **Redshift** from the list of destinations.\n2.  Assign a name to your destination and then click **Next**.\n\n### Connection settings\n\n*   **Host**: The host name of your Redshift service.\n*   **Port**: The port number associated with the Redshift database instance.\n*   **Database**: The database name in your Redshift instance where the data will be sent.\n*   **User**: The name of the user with the required read/write access to the above database.\n*   **Password**: The password for the above user.\n*   **Namespace**: Enter the schema name where RudderStack will create all tables. If you don’t specify any namespace, RudderStack will set this to the source name, by default.\n\n### SSH connection\n\nSSH tunneling is a method of transferring data over an encrypted SSH connection. You can use it to add encryption to your legacy applications and achieve compliance with regulations like HIPAA, PCI-DSS, etc., without having to modify the existing applications.\n\nRudderStack lets you connect to your Redshift database securely over an SSH connection by configuring these settings:\n\n[![Redshift edit configuration](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warehouse-destinations/ssh-connection.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warehouse-destinations/ssh-connection.webp)\n\n*   **SSH Connection**: Enable this setting to use the SSH connection while connecting to your Redshift database.\n*   **SSH Host**: Enter the IP address of your bastion host.\n*   **SSH Port**: Enter the port for the above host.\n*   **SSH User**: Enter the username you use to access the bastion host.\n*   **SSH Public Key**: Copy the public key provided in this field and add it to the `authorized_keys` file on your bastion host. Rudderstack will use the private key corresponding to this public key to establish the connection successully.\n\nTo enable the SSH connection for an existing Redshift destination, navigate to the destination’s **Configuration** tab, select **Edit configuration** and enable the **SSH connection** setting.\n\n### Sync settings\n\n*   **Sync Frequency**: Specify how often RudderStack should sync the data to your Redshift database.\n*   **Sync Starting At**: This optional setting lets you specify the particular time of the day (in UTC) when you want RudderStack to sync the data to the warehouse.\n*   **Exclude Window**: This optional setting lets you set a time window when RudderStack will **not sync** the data to your database.\n\n### Configuring the object storage\n\nRudderStack lets you configure the following object storage configuration settings while setting up your Redshift destination:\n\n*   **Use RudderStack-managed object storage**: Enable this setting to use RudderStack-managed buckets for object storage.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> This option is applicable only for RudderStack-hosted data planes. For [self-hosted data planes](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/get-started/rudderstack-open-source/data-plane-setup/), you will have to specify your own object storage configuration settings.\n\n*   **Staging S3 Storage Bucket Name**: If **Use RudderStack-managed object storage** is disabled in the dashboard, enter the relevant [Amazon S3 bucket storage settings](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/amazon-s3/#connection-settings).\n\nSee [How RudderStack stores data in an object storage platform](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/warehouse-destinations/faq/#how-does-rudderstack-store-data-in-an-object-storage-platform) for more information.\n\n### Advanced settings\n\nRudderStack provides the following advanced settings:\n\n*   **Warehouse Append**: This setting is turned on by default - RudderStack appends your incoming Event Stream data to the existing data in your warehouse. Turning it off causes RudderStack to merge your incoming data into your warehouse to ensure 100% non-duplicate data.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> The append operation helps to achieve faster data syncs while reducing warehouse costs. However, note that it may increase the number of duplicates in the warehouse, especially if the existing data is older than two weeks. A common scenario where duplication might occur is when the SDKs retry sending events in case of failures.\n> \n> A merge strategy ensures deduplication but can lead to longer sync times and increased warehouse costs.\n\n*   **Skip User Table**: Toggle on this setting to send events exclusively to the [`identifies`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/warehouse-destinations/warehouse-schema/#schema) table and skip the [`users`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/warehouse-destinations/warehouse-schema/#schema) table, eliminating the need for a merge operation on the `users` table.\n*   **Skip Tracks Table**: Toggle on this setting to skip sending events to the [`tracks`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/warehouse-destinations/warehouse-schema/#schema) table.\n*   **JSON Columns**: Lets you ingest semi-structured event data not defined by a fixed schema. You can specify the required JSON column paths in this setting in dot notation, separated by commas. **This option applies to all incoming `track` events for this destination**. See [JSON Column Support](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/warehouse-destinations/json-column-support/) for more information.\n\n## S3 Permissions\n\nThe alternative to providing AWS credentials for S3 access, is to set up permissions for your bucket as specified in the following section:\n\n### RudderStack-hosted data plane\n\nYou need to edit your bucket policy to allow RudderStack to write to your bucket with the following JSON:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n  \"Statement\": [\n    {\n      \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n      \"Principal\": {\n        \"AWS\": \"arn:aws:iam::422074288268:user/s3-copy\"\n      },\n      \"Action\": [\n        \"s3:GetObject\",\n        \"s3:PutObject\",\n        \"s3:PutObjectAcl\",\n        \"s3:ListBucket\"\n      ],\n      \"Resource\": [\n        \"arn:aws:s3:::YOUR_BUCKET_NAME/*\",\n        \"arn:aws:s3:::YOUR_BUCKET_NAME\"\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Self-hosted data plane\n\n1.  Create an IAM policy with the following JSON:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n  \"Statement\": [\n    {\n      \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n      \"Action\": \"*\",\n      \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:s3:::*\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n2.  Create an IAM user with programmatic access keys and attach the above created IAM policy. Copy the ARN of this user.\n3.  Edit your bucket policy to allow the data plane to write to your bucket with the following JSON. Make sure you edit the account id and user ARN with your AWS Account ID and the above created user ARN:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n  \"Statement\": [\n    {\n      \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n      \"Principal\": {\n        \"AWS\": \"arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT_ID:user/USER_ARN\"\n      },\n      \"Action\": [\n        \"s3:GetObject\",\n        \"s3:PutObject\",\n        \"s3:PutObjectAcl\",\n        \"s3:ListBucket\"\n      ],\n      \"Resource\": [\n        \"arn:aws:s3:::YOUR_BUCKET_NAME/*\",\n        \"arn:aws:s3:::YOUR_BUCKET_NAME\"\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n4.  Finally, add the programmatic access credentials to the environment of your data plane:\n\n```\nRUDDER_AWS_S3_COPY_USER_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<above created user access key>\nRUDDER_AWS_S3_COPY_USER_ACCESS_KEY=<above created user access key secret>\n```\n\n## Column compression encoding\n\nCompression encoding specifies the type of compression applied to a column of data values as rows are added to a table.\n\nIf not specified, Redshift automatically assigns [compression encoding](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/c_Compression_encodings.html). RudderStack explicitly sets the [runlength](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/c_Runlength_encoding.html) encoding for Boolean columns.\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### How are reserved words handled by RudderStack?\n\nThere are some limitations when it comes to using [reserved words](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/r_pg_keywords.html) in a schema, table, or column names. If such words are used in event names, traits or properties, they will be prefixed with a `_`when RudderStack creates tables or columns for them in your schema.\n\nBesides, integers are not allowed at the start of the schema or table name. Hence, such schema, column or table names will be prefixed with a `_`.\n\nFor instance, `'25dollarpurchase`’ will be changed to `'_25dollarpurchase`'.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> For a more comprehensive FAQ list, refer to the [Warehouse FAQ](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/warehouse-destinations/faq/) guide.\n\nQuestions?

Create a Google Cloud Platform (**GCP**) project if you don’t have one already. For more details, refer to this [BigQuery documentation](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects?hl=en&ref_topic=6158848&visit_id=637219216155418807-3094012232&rd=1).\n2.  Enable the BigQuery API for your existing project if it’s not done already. For more information, refer to this [BigQuery documentation](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/quickstarts/quickstart-web-ui).\n3.  Log into your [BigQuery console](https://console.cloud.google.com/). Copy the project **ID** as shown in the following image:\n\n[![Copy the Project ID](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/screenshot-2020-04-08-at-11.36.30-am.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/screenshot-2020-04-08-at-11.36.30-am.webp)\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> This project ID is required for configuring BigQuery as a destination in RudderStack.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> To enable RudderStack to load data into your BigQuery cluster, make sure that [billing](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/modify-project) is enabled for the project.\n\n4.  Create a new Google Cloud Storage (**GCS**) bucket or provide an existing one to store files before loading the data into your BigQuery instance.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> To make sure that the data loads from GCS to BigQuery, co-locate your GCS storage bucket with BigQuery. For more information, refer to the [BigQuery documentation](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/loading-data-cloud-storage#data-locations).\n\n## Setting up the service account for RudderStack\n\nFor RudderStack to successfully send events to your BigQuery instance, you also need to set up a service account with the necessary permissions.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> Make sure that you create the service account for the same BigQuery project.\n\nFollow the steps below to set up a service account:\n\n1.  Create a new service account by going to **IAM & Admin** > **Service Accounts**.\n2.  Add the service account permissions as specified below:\n\n*   Add the `Storage Object Creator` and `Storage Object Viewer` roles to the account.\n*   Add the `BigQuery Job User` and `BigQuery Data Owner` roles to the account.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> If a dataset name (configurable by the setting: **Namespace** in the RudderStack dashboard) already exists, the role of **BigQuery Data Editor** would suffice instead of **BigQuery Data Owner**.\n\n3.  Create a key for the service account with **JSON** as the type and store it.\n\n[![Create a key](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/screenshot-2020-04-08-at-12.09.07-pm%20%281%29%20%281%29%20%281%29%20%281%29%20%281%29%20%281%29%20%281%29%20%281%29%20%281%29%20%281%29.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/screenshot-2020-04-08-at-12.09.07-pm%20%281%29%20%281%29%20%281%29%20%281%29%20%281%29%20%281%29%20%281%29%20%281%29%20%281%29%20%281%29.webp)\n\n4.  Create and download the private JSON key required for configuring BigQuery as a destination in RudderStack:\n\n[![JSON key required for the RudderStack UI](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/screenshot-2020-04-08-at-12.09.32-pm%20%281%29.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/screenshot-2020-04-08-at-12.09.32-pm%20%281%29.webp)\n\n## IPs to be allowlisted\n\nBy default, you can access BigQuery via the Google APIs, which are publicly accessible. As such, allowlisting any IPs is **not required**. However, if your VPC service restricts the BigQuery APIs, you will need to allowlist the below IPs by [setting up network access control for BigQuery](https://staging.medium.com/setting-up-network-access-control-for-bigquery-3957be554467).\n\nTo enable network access to RudderStack, allowlist the following RudderStack IPs depending on your region and [RudderStack Cloud plan](https://www.rudderstack.com/pricing):\n\n| Plan | Region |     |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|     | **<br><br>US<br><br>** | **<br><br>EU<br><br>** |\n| Free, Starter, and Growth | *   3.216.35.97<br>*   18.214.35.254<br>*   23.20.96.9<br>*   34.198.90.241<br>*   34.211.241.254<br>*   52.38.160.231<br>*   54.147.40.62 | *   3.123.104.182<br>*   3.125.132.33<br>*   18.198.90.215<br>*   18.196.167.201 |\n| Enterprise | *   3.216.35.97<br>*   34.198.90.241<br>*   44.236.60.231<br>*   54.147.40.62<br>*   100.20.239.77 | *   3.66.99.198<br>*   3.64.201.167<br>*   3.123.104.182<br>*   3.125.132.33 |\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> All the outbound traffic is routed through these RudderStack IPs.\n\n## Configuring Google BigQuery destination in RudderStack\n\nTo send event data to BigQuery, you first need to add it as a destination in RudderStack and connect it to your data source. Once the destination is enabled, events will automatically start flowing to BigQuery via RudderStack.\n\nTo configure BigQuery as a destination in RudderStack, follow these steps:\n\n1.  In your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), set up the data source. Then, select **BigQuery** from the list of destinations.\n2.  Assign a name to your destination and then click **Next**.\n\n### Connection settings\n\n*   **Project**: The GCP project ID where the BigQuery database is located.\n*   **Location**: The GCP region for your dataset.\n*   **Staging GCS Storage Bucket Name**: The name of the storage bucket as specified in the [Setting up the BigQuery project](#setting-up-the-bigquery-project) section.\n*   **Prefix**: If specified, RudderStack creates a folder in the bucket with this prefix and pushes all data within that folder.\n*   **Namespace**: Enter the schema name where RudderStack will create all tables. If you don’t specify any namespace, RudderStack will set this to the source name, by default.\n*   **Credentials**: Your GCP service account credentials JSON as created in the [Setting up the service account for RudderStack](#setting-up-the-service-account-for-rudderstack) section.\n*   **Sync Frequency**: Specify how often RudderStack should sync the data to your BigQuery dataset.\n*   **Sync Starting At**: This optional setting lets you specify the particular time of the day (in UTC) when you want RudderStack to sync the data to BigQuery.\n*   **Exclude Window**: This optional setting lets you set a time window when RudderStack will **not sync** the data to your database.\n\n### Advanced settings\n\n*   **Skip User Table**: Toggle on this setting to send events exclusively to the [`identifies`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/warehouse-destinations/warehouse-schema/#schema) table and skip the [`users`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/warehouse-destinations/warehouse-schema/#schema) table, eliminating the need for a merge operation on the `users` table.\n*   **Skip Tracks Table**: Toggle on this setting to skip sending events to the [`tracks`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/warehouse-destinations/warehouse-schema/#schema) table.\n*   **JSON Columns**: Use this optional setting to specify the required JSON column paths in dot notation, separated by commas. **This option applies to all incoming `track` events for this destination.**\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> With the JSON columns feature, you can now ingest semi-structured event data not defined by a fixed schema. For more information on this feature, refer to the [JSON Column Support](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/warehouse-destinations/json-column-support/) guide.\n\n## Schema, partitioned tables, views, and deduplication\n\nRudderStack uses the source name (written in snake case, for example, `source_name`) to create a dataset in BigQuery.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> For more details on the tables and columns created by RudderStack, refer to the [Warehouse Schema](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/warehouse-destinations/warehouse-schema/) guide.\n\nRudderStack supports two modes by which data is ingested into BigQuery:\n\n*   Partitioned tables (default method)\n*   Deduplication\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> By default, RudderStack uses the partitioned tables method to ingest data into BigQuery. Deduplication is disabled.\n\nIf you are using [RudderStack Open Source](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/get-started/rudderstack-open-source/) or hosting the RudderStack data plane, you can manage these modes via the environment variable `RSERVER_WAREHOUSE_BIGQUERY_IS_DEDUP_ENABLED`, as shown in the following table:\n\n| Ingestion method | `RSERVER_WAREHOUSE_BIGQUERY_IS_DEDUP_ENABLED` |\n| --- | --- |\n| Partitioned tables | `false` |\n| Deduplication | `true` |\n\n### Partitioned tables and views\n\nRudderStack creates ingestion-time partition tables based on the load date, so you can take advantage of it to query a subset of data.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> Duplicate data is **not** discarded when loading it into BigQuery.\n\nIn addition to tables, RudderStack creates a **view** (`<table_name>_view`) for every table for de-duplication purposes.\n\nIt is highly recommended that you use the corresponding view (containing the events from the last 60 days) to avoid duplicate events in your query results. Since BigQuery [views](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/views-intro#view_pricing) are merely logical views and are not cached, you can create a native table from it to save money - by avoiding running the query that defines the view every time.\n\n> ![success](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/tick.svg)\n> \n> Users can modify the view query to change the time window of the view. The default value is set to **60 days**.\n\n### Deduplication method\n\nIn this method, RudderStack automatically discards any duplicate events while loading them into the BigQuery tables. To enable this method, set the environment variable `RSERVER_WAREHOUSE_BIGQUERY_IS_DEDUP_ENABLED` in your RudderStack data plane setup to `true`.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> Note the following:\n> \n> *   The RudderStack team handles this setting for the RudderStack Cloud [Growth](https://www.rudderstack.com/pricing/) and [Enterprise](https://www.rudderstack.com/enterprise-quote/) plans.\n> *   Views will **not** be created for the tables if you choose the deduplication method.\n> *   The **querying cost will increase** if you choose this method, as RudderStack removes the duplicates from the tables through sequential scans that happen on every warehouse upload. For example, if your warehouse upload frequency is set to every 30 minutes, RudderStack performs a full scan on the `tracks` table every 30 minutes to upload any new events.\n\n### Switching from deduplication to partitioned tables\n\nYou can easily switch from using the deduplication method to ingest your data in BigQuery to the partitioned tables by setting the environment variable `RSERVER_WAREHOUSE_BIGQUERY_IS_DEDUP_ENABLED` in your RudderStack setup to `false`.\n\nRudderStack then does the following:\n\n*   Creates `users_view` while loading the `users` table, **if not already present**.\n*   Creates the views for the new `track` events.\n*   All the other skipped views are not regenerated. You can either manually create those views or [contact us](https://www.rudderstack.com/contact) to create them.\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### Where do I add the allowlisted IPs in BigQuery?\n\nBy default, BigQuery is accessible via publicly accessible Google APIs. As such, allowlisting any IPs is not required. However, if your VPC service restricts the BigQuery APIs, you will need to [allowlist the IPs](#ips-to-be-allowlisted) by [setting up network access control for BigQuery](https://staging.medium.com/setting-up-network-access-control-for-bigquery-3957be554467).\n\n#### How are reserved words handled by RudderStack?\n\nThere are some limitations when it comes to using [reserved words](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/lexical#reserved_keywords) in a schema, table, or column names. If such words are used in event names, traits or properties, they will be prefixed with a `_`when RudderStack creates tables or columns for them in your schema.\n\nBesides, integers are not allowed at the start of the schema or table name. Hence, such schema, column or table names will be prefixed with a `_`.\n\nFor instance, `'25dollarpurchase`’ will be changed to `'_25dollarpurchase`'.\n\n#### When sending data into a data warehouse, how can I change the table where this data is sent?\n\nBy default, RudderStack sends the data to the table/dataset based on the source it is connected to. For example, if the source is Google Tag Manager, RudderStack sets the schema name as `gtm_*`. However, you can override this behavior by setting the **Namespace** field in the BigQuery destination settings:\n\n[![Namespace](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/image%20%2879%29.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/image%20%2879%29.webp)\n\n#### I’m looking to send data to BigQuery through RudderStack and I’m trying to understand what data is populated in each column. How do I go about this?\n\nRefer to the [Warehouse Schema](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/warehouse-destinations/warehouse-schema/) documentation for details on how RudderStack generates the schema in the warehouse and populates the data in each column.\n\n#### I am trying to load data into my BigQuery destination and I get the error “Cannot read and write in different locations”. What should I do?\n\nMake sure that both your BigQuery dataset and the bucket have the same region.\n\n#### When piping data to a BigQuery destination, I can set the bucket but not a folder within the bucket. Is there a way to put RudderStack data in a specific bucket folder?\n\nYes, you can set the desired folder name in the **Prefix** field while setting up your BigQuery destination in RudderStack.\n\n#### Does open source RudderStack support near real-time syncing to BigQuery and event replay?\n\nThe near-realtime BigQuery syncing feature is currently under development and is planned to be released in the coming months. Unfortunately, Event Replay is not a part of open-source RudderStack currently.\n\n#### What is the current sync frequency for BigQuery?\n\nIf you’re using open source RudderStack, the minimum sync frequency is **30 minutes**. If you’re self-hosting the data plane or using RudderStack’s [Enterprise plan](https://www.rudderstack.com/enterprise-quote/), you can assign the required value for sync frequency to the `uploadFreqInS` parameter in `config.yaml` file. Note that the minimum value can be `1800` (30 minutes).\n\nFor more information, refer to this [FAQ](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/warehouse-destinations/faq/#is-there-a-way-to-force-load-my-data-into-the-warehouse).\n\n#### Do I need to stop the running pipeline to change my sync frequency? Or will the new change be effective even without stopping the pipeline?\n\nTo change the sync frequency, you **need not** stop the pipeline.\n\n#### When configuring the BigQuery destination, where does Google use the credentials JSON from?\n\nBigQuery uses the credentials JSON from the dashboard configuration when setting up the destination. For more information, refer to the [Setting up the service account for RudderStack](#setting-up-the-service-account-for-rudderstack) section.\n\n#### When configuring the BigQuery destination, should the user permissions be set for the specific dataset or the whole project?\n\nYou need to set the user permissions for the whole project. Otherwise, you may encounter issues.\n\n#### How long are the failed syncs retried before being aborted?\n\nRudderStack retries the failed syncs for up to 3 hours before aborting them. For more information, refer to this [FAQ](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/resources/faq/#how-does-rudderstack-handle-retries-for-failed-events-in-case-of-destination-failure).\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> For a more comprehensive FAQ list, refer to the [Warehouse FAQ](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/warehouse-destinations/faq/) guide.\n\nQuestions?

    "markdown": "# Connection Modes: Cloud, Device, and Hybrid\n\nLearn the difference between cloud mode, device mode, and hybrid mode when sending event data to your destinations.\n\n* * *\n\n*     5 minute read  \n    \n\nThis guide clarifies and details the differences between the two main RudderStack connection modes - **cloud mode** and **device mode**. It also give an overview on **hybrid mode**, which is currently applicable only to a limited number of destinations.\n\n## What are connection modes in RudderStack?\n\nRudderStack’s workflow is simple - it receives the event data from the **sources** and routes this data to the **destinations**. The connection modes determine how RudderStack tracks, transforms, and routes this event data.\n\nThere are primarily two connection modes through which you can send your event data from your source apps to the desired destinations via RudderStack:\n\n*   Cloud mode\n*   Device mode\n\nFor some selective destinations, RudderStack also supports a hybrid mode connection which routes the event through both the cloud and device modes.\n\n## Cloud mode\n\nIn this mode, the SDK sends the event data directly to the RudderStack server. RudderStack then transforms this data and routes it to the desired destination. This transformation is done in the RudderStack backend, using RudderStack’s [Transformer](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-transformer) module.\n\n> ![success](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/tick.svg)\n> \n> When you send events via cloud mode, you also get the flexibility to use [RudderStack Transformations](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/transformations/overview/) to implement custom logic on the events before forwarding them to the destinations.\n\n### How cloud mode works\n\n1.  The SDK sends the event data directly to the RudderStack server (backend).\n2.  RudderStack transforms the events into a destination-specific format.\n3.  The transformed events are then routed to the destination.\n\nSuppose you want to analyze your website data in Google Analytics. To do so, you can use RudderStack’s [JavaScript SDK](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/).\n\nRudderStack defines a [fixed event structure](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/). If you track your events in this format, RudderStack takes care of transforming the events as required by Google Analytics. You can start by [adding a JavaScript source](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/dashboard-guides/sources/#adding-a-source) and connecting it to the [Google Analytics destination](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/google-analytics-ga/) in your RudderStack dashboard.\n\nThen, enable event tracking on your website by [adding the JavaScript SDK snippet](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/quickstart/#step-1-install-rudderstack-javascript-sdk).\n\nThe SDK will automatically track and send the events to RudderStack. RudderStack then transforms this data into the required format and sends it to Google Analytics.\n\n[![RudderStack Cloud Mode](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/rs-cloud/rudderstack-cloud-mode.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/rs-cloud/rudderstack-cloud-mode.webp)\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> Note that:\n> \n> *   RudderStack’s [warehouse destinations](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/warehouse-destinations/) support sending data only through cloud mode.\n> *   All the RudderStack server-side SDKs support sending events only through cloud mode. This is because the server-side SDKs operate in the RudderStack backend and cannot load any additional destination-specific SDKs.\n\n## Device mode\n\nIn device mode, RudderStack sends the event data to the destinations directly from your client (web or mobile app).\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack does not support the [Live Events](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/dashboard-guides/live-events/) functionality in device mode.\n\nThe RudderStack SDKs first load the native client libraries on your website or mobile app. These libraries allow RudderStack to use the data you collect on your device to call the destination APIs - without sending it to the RudderStack servers first.\n\n### How device mode works\n\nSuppose you want to send your event data from your mobile app to Firebase via the RudderStack Android SDK (or any other mobile SDK). You can start by [adding an Android source](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/dashboard-guides/sources/#adding-a-source) and connecting it to the [Firebase destination](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/firebase/) in the RudderStack dashboard.\n\nThe RudderStack SDK will first download the Firebase SDK, transform the events natively, and then send them over to Firebase.\n\n[![RudderStack device mode](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/rs-cloud/rudderstack-device-mode.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/rs-cloud/rudderstack-device-mode.webp)\n\nFor some destinations, you can use the [JavaScript SDK](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/) to send the events via device mode. To do so, enable the **Use native SDK to send events** option under the destination-specific connection settings in the RudderStack dashboard:\n\n[![RudderStack web SDK settings](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/rs-cloud/web-device-mode-settings.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/rs-cloud/web-device-mode-settings.webp)\n\n## Hybrid mode\n\nIn hybrid mode, RudderStack sends certain event data to the destination directly from your client while routing the remaining events through the RudderStack server.\n\nHybrid mode features include:\n\n*   A singular connection capturing critical event data automatically generated by the native SDKs.\n*   All the benefits of cloud mode like:\n    *   Faster site\n    *   Reliable data collection\n    *   First-party data capture\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### Which connection mode should I choose?\n\n*   Use cloud mode if you wish to run a faster site with reliable data collection and first-party data capture.\n*   If you are planning to work with the destinations that record information directly on your users’ devices, choose device mode. There is a possibility that these destinations might not function correctly if they are not loaded directly on the device.\n\n#### How to check which connection mode is supported by the destination?\n\nThe easiest way to check the connection mode supported by the destination is to go refer to the individual destination’s [documentation](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/overview/).\n\nThe supported connection modes are mentioned for every destination in the **Getting Started** section of their respective documentation, as seen below:\n\n[![Getting Started section in destination docs](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/rs-cloud/getting-started-connection-modes.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/rs-cloud/getting-started-connection-modes.webp)\n\nSome RudderStack destinations support sending events via both the cloud and device mode. Some examples include:\n\n*   [Google Analytics](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/google-analytics-ga/)\n*   [HubSpot](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/hubspot/)\n*   [Intercom](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/intercom/)\n*   [Kissmetrics](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/kissmetrics/)\n*   [Branch.io](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/branchio/)\n*   [Braze](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/braze/)\n*   [Customer.io](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/customer.io/)\n*   [Facebook App Events](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/facebook-app-events/)\n\n#### What are the benefits of using cloud mode to send events to the destination?\n\nIn cloud mode, the event data is sent from the sources directly to the RudderStack server. RudderStack takes care of the event transformation and ensuring the format matches the destination’s requirements. Since this transformation happens in the RudderStack server itself, your page size as well as the load times are not affected at all.\n\n#### Can I use an event forwarding or data plane proxy in the device mode?\n\nYes, you can use an event forwarding/data plane proxy while sending events to your destinations via device mode. The default vendor API endpoint will still work as expected.\n\nQuestions? Contact us by [email](mailto:docs@rudderstack.com) or on [Slack](https://rudderstack.com/join-rudderstack-slack-community)",

Finally, download this JSON file. This file is required while setting up the GCS data lake destination in RudderStack.\n\n## Configuring GCS data lake destination in RudderStack\n\nTo send event data to GCS data lake, you first need to add it as a destination in RudderStack and connect it to your data source. Once the destination is enabled, events will automatically start flowing to GCS data lake via RudderStack.\n\nTo configure GCS data lake as a destination in RudderStack, follow these steps:\n\n1.  In your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), set up the data source. Then, select **Google Cloud Storage Data Lake** from the list of destinations.\n2.  Assign a name to your destination and then click **Next**.\n\n### Connection settings\n\n*   **GCS Storage Bucket Name**: The name of the GCS bucket used to store data before loading it into the GCS data lake.\n*   **Prefix**: If specified, RudderStack will create a folder in the bucket with this prefix and push all data within that folder. For example, `https://storage.googleapis.com/<bucketName>/<prefix>/`.\n*   **Namespace**: If specified, all data for the destination will be pushed to `https://storage.googleapis.com/<bucketName>/<prefix>/rudder-datalake/<namespace>`. If you don’t specify a namespace in the settings, RudderStack sets it to the source name, by default.\n*   **Table Suffix**: This optional setting lets you define a custom path under which your table data is stored. For example, if you set this field to `rs`, your data will be pushed to `https://storage.googleapis.com/<bucketName>/<prefix>/rudder-datalake/<namespace>/<table-name>/rs`.\n*   **Choose time window layout**: This option lets you set the timestamp-defined layout structure under which the table data will be stored.\n\n[![GCS data lake destination settings in RudderStack](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/dw-integrations/gcs-datalake-time-window-layout.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/dw-integrations/gcs-datalake-time-window-layout.webp)\n\nFor example, if you choose the option **Upto Hour (year=YYYY/month=MM/day=DD/hour=HH)** and an event called `Product Clicked` is received at `2022-08-06T17:30:00.000T`, then the data will be stored in the following location:\n\n```\nhttps://storage.googleapis.com/<bucketName>/<prefix>/rudder-datalake/<namespace>/<table_name>/<table_suffix>/year=2022/month=08/day=06/hour=17/\n```\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> The default value for this setting is **YYYY/MM/DD/HH**.\n\n*   **Credentials**: Enter the content of the downloaded credentials JSON file in this field.\n*   **Sync Frequency**: Specify how often RudderStack should sync the data to your GCS data lake.\n*   **Sync Starting At**: This optional setting lets you specify the particular time of the day (in UTC) when you want RudderStack to sync the data to the data lake.\n\n### Advanced settings\n\n*   **Skip User Table**: Toggle on this setting to send events exclusively to the [`identifies`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/warehouse-destinations/warehouse-schema/#schema) table and skip the [`users`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/warehouse-destinations/warehouse-schema/#schema) table, eliminating the need for a merge operation on the `users` table.\n*   **Skip Tracks Table**: Toggle on this setting to skip sending events to the [`tracks`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/warehouse-destinations/warehouse-schema/#schema) table.\n\n## Finding your data in the GCS data lake\n\nRudderStack converts your events into Parquet files and dumps them into the configured GCS bucket. Before dumping the events, RudderStack groups the files by the event name based on the time (in UTC) they were received.\n\nThe folder structure is similar to the following format:\n\n```\nhttps://storage.googleapis.com/<bucketName>/<prefix>/rudder-datalake/<namespace>/<tableName>/YYYY/MM/DD/HH\n```\n\nAs specified in the [Connection settings](#connection-settings) section above:\n\n*   `<prefix>` is the GCS prefix used while configuring the GCS data lake destination in RudderStack. If not specified, RudderStack will omit this value.\n*   `<namespace>` is the namespace specified in the destination settings. If not specified, RudderStack sets it to the source name.\n*   `<tableName>` is set to the event name.\n*   `YYYY`, `MM`, `DD`, and `HH` are replaced by the actual time values.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> A combination of the `YYYY`, `MM`, `DD`, and `HH` values represents the UTC time.\n\n### Use case\n\nSuppose that RudderStack tracks the following two events:\n\n| Event Name | Timestamp |\n| --- | --- |\n| Product Purchased | `\"2019-10-12T08:40:50.52Z\" UTC` |\n| Cart Viewed | `\"2019-11-12T09:34:50.52Z\" UTC` |\n\nRudderStack then converts these events into Parquet files and dumps them into the following folders:\n\n| Event Name | Folder Location |\n| --- | --- |\n| Product Purchased | `https://storage.googleapis.com/<bucketName>/<prefix>/rudder-datalake/<namespace>/product_purchased/2019/10/12/08` |\n| Cart Viewed | `https://storage.googleapis.com/<bucketName>/<prefix>/rudder-datalake/<namespace>/cart_viewed/2019/11/12/09` |\n\n## IPs to be allowlisted\n\nTo enable network access to RudderStack, allowlist the following RudderStack IPs depending on your region and [RudderStack Cloud plan](https://www.rudderstack.com/pricing):\n\n| Plan | Region |     |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|     | **<br><br>US<br><br>** | **<br><br>EU<br><br>** |\n| Free, Starter, and Growth | *   3.216.35.97<br>*   18.214.35.254<br>*   23.20.96.9<br>*   34.198.90.241<br>*   34.211.241.254<br>*   52.38.160.231<br>*   54.147.40.62 | *   3.123.104.182<br>*   3.125.132.33<br>*   18.198.90.215<br>*   18.196.167.201 |\n| Enterprise | *   3.216.35.97<br>*   34.198.90.241<br>*   44.236.60.231<br>*   54.147.40.62<br>*   100.20.239.77 | *   3.66.99.198<br>*   3.64.201.167<br>*   3.123.104.182<br>*   3.125.132.33 |\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> All the outbound traffic is routed through these RudderStack IPs.\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### What are the files written in the location `<namespace>/rudder-warehouse-staging-logs/`?\n\nRudderStack collects all unprocessed data flowing to the warehouse destinations as staging files.

    "markdown": "# Materialize | RudderStack Docs\n\nSend your event data from RudderStack to Materialize.\n\n* * *\n\n*     3 minute read  \n    \n\n[Materialize](https://materialize.com/) is a streaming database used to process data at scale and high speeds without the cost and complexity of the traditional streaming platforms.\n\nYou can set up Materialize as a webhook destination in RudderStack to seamlessly send your event data.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nBefore you begin, make sure you have created a Materialize cluster and a webhook source in Materialize to ingest data from RudderStack.\n\n### Step 1: Create Materialize cluster\n\nTo create a managed cluster in Materialize, run the following SQL command:\n\n```\nCREATE CLUSTER rudderstack_cluster SIZE = '3xsmall';\n```\n\nSee the Materialize documentation on [creating a cluster](https://materialize.com/docs/sql/create-cluster/) for more information.\n\n### Step 2: Create shared secret\n\nEstablish a shared secret to ensure the authenticity of data sent from RudderStack to Materialize. The following command creates a shared secret that lets RudderStack authenticate each incoming request and ensure data integrity.\n\n```\nCREATE SECRET rudderstack_shared_secret AS '<secret_value>';\n```\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> Make sure to change `<secret_value>` to a unique value and store it in a secure location for later reference.\n\n### Step 3: Set up webhook source in Materialize\n\nUse the secret from [Step 2](#step-2-create-shared-secret) to [create a webhook source](https://materialize.com/docs/sql/create-source/webhook/) in Materialize and ingest data coming from RudderStack:\n\n```\nCREATE SOURCE rudderstack_source IN CLUSTER rudderstack_cluster\n  FROM WEBHOOK\n    BODY FORMAT JSON\n    CHECK (\n      WITH (\n        HEADERS,\n        BODY AS request_body,\n        SECRET rudderstack_shared_secret\n      )\n      constant_time_eq(headers->'authorization', rudderstack_shared_secret)\n);\n```\n\n## Set up webhook destination in RudderStack\n\nFollow these steps to set up Materialize as a webhook destination in RudderStack:\n\n1.  In your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), go to **Directory** > **Destinations** > **Cloud Destinations** and search for **Webhook**.\n2.  Select the source from where you want to ingest events and click **Continue**. See [Add a source](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/dashboard-guides/sources/#add-a-source) for more information.\n\n### Connection settings\n\nConfigure the following settings to set up Ortto as a destination in RudderStack:\n\n*   **Webhook URL**: Define the endpoint used to dispatch the events ingested by RudderStack. The [webhook URL structure](https://materialize.com/docs/sql/create-source/webhook/#webhook-url) is defined as:\n\n```\nhttps://<HOST>/api/webhook/<database>/<schema>/<src_name>\n```\n\n*   **URL Method**: Select the `POST` method from the dropdown used to send events to Materialize.\n    \n*   **Headers**: Specify the headers that are added to every RudderStack request sent to your webhook. Make sure to add the following headers:\n    \n    *   `Content-Type`: `application/json`\n    *   `Authorization`: `<secret_value`\\> obtained in [Step 2: Create shared secret](#step-2-create-shared-secret).\n*   **OneTrust cookie consent settings**: This setting lets you associate the [OneTrust](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/data-governance/consent-management/onetrust/) cookie consent groups to Materialize.\n    \n\n## Monitor incoming data\n\n1.  Log in to the [Materialize console](https://console.materialize.com/).\n2.  Go to the SQL shell.\n3.  Select your cluster.\n4.  Use SQL queries to analyze the incoming data:\n\n```\nSELECT * FROM rudderstack_source;\n```\n\nHere, `rudderstack_source` is the webhook source created in [Step 3: Set up webhook source](#step-3-set-up-webhook-source-in-materialize) to ingest data coming from RudderStack.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> If you do not see any data, check the [Live Events](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/dashboard-guides/live-events/) tab to verify if the events are flowing through correctly.\n\n## Parse incoming data\n\nYou can create materialized views to parse any incoming data from RudderStack, depending on your use case. An example is shown below:\n\n```\nCREATE VIEW json_parsed AS\n  SELECT\n    (body -> '_metadata' ->> 'nodeVersion')::text AS nodeVersion,\n    (body ->> 'channel')::text AS channel,\n    (body ->> 'event')::text AS event,\n    (body ->> 'userId')::text AS userId\n  FROM rudderstack_source;\n```\n\nIn the above query, `json_parsed` parses the incoming data and transforms the JSON structure into columns in your Materialize schema like `nodeVersion`, `channel`, `event`, and `userId`.\n\nYou can also use the `DISTINCT` clause to remove any duplicates received due to any issues. For more information, see the [Materialize webhook source documentation](https://materialize.com/docs/sql/create-source/webhook/#handling-duplicated-and-partial-events).\n\nQuestions?

    "markdown": "# Microsoft SQL Server | RudderStack Docs\n\nSync data from RudderStack to Microsoft SQL Server.\n\n* * *\n\n*     5 minute read  \n    \n\n[Microsoft SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/sql-server/sql-server-downloads) is a popular relational database management system (RDBMS). ideal for a variety of data workloads - from small-scale, single-machine data applications to large data applications with thousands of concurrent users.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Refer to the [Warehouse Schema](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/warehouse-destinations/warehouse-schema/) guide for more information on how the events are mapped to the tables in SQL Server.\n\n## Setting user permissions in SQL Server\n\nAfter setting up your SQL Server database, create a user with the necessary privileges to create schemas and temporary tables in this database.\n\nTo create a SQL Server instance on Docker, run the following commands:\n\n```\ndocker run -e \"ACCEPT_EULA=Y\" -e \"SA_PASSWORD=Test@123\" -p 1433:1433 --name rudder_mssql -h rudder_mssql -d mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2019-latest\n```\n\n```\ndocker exec -it rudder_mssql \"bash\" /opt/mssql-tools/bin/sqlcmd -S localhost -U SA [-P \"Test@123\"]\n```\n\nIn the above commands, the user is `SA` (System Admin) and password is `Test@123`.\n\nThe following queries let you create a user and grant the above-mentioned privileges (creating schemas and temporary tables on the database) to that user:\n\n```\nCREATE LOGIN testuser WITH PASSWORD = 'Test@123';\nCREATE USER testuser FOR LOGIN testuser ;\n\nCREATE DATABASE test_db\nUSE test_db\n-- GRANT individual permissions like this or\nGRANT CREATE TABLE TO testuser\n-- Provides owner permissions to user\nEXEC sp_addrolemember N'db_owner', N'testuser'\n```\n\n### Using AWS RDS instance\n\nYou can execute the same commands via Azure Studio or using the **sqlcmd** utility (`cmdline sqlcmd`).\n\n## Configuring SQL Server destination in RudderStack\n\nTo send event data to SQL Server, you first need to add it as a destination in RudderStack and connect it to your data source. Once the destination is enabled, events will automatically start flowing to SQL Server via RudderStack.\n\nTo configure SQL Server as a destination in RudderStack, follow these steps:\n\n1.  In your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), set up the data source. Then, select **Microsoft SQL Server** from the list of destinations.\n2.  Assign a name to your destination and then click **Next**.\n\n### Connection settings\n\n*   **Host**: The host name of your SQL Server service.\n*   **Database**: The database name in your SQL Server instance where the data will be sent.\n*   **User**: The name of the user with the required read/write access to the above database.\n*   **Password**: The password for the above user.\n*   **Port**: The port number associated with the SQL Server database instance.\n*   **Namespace**: Enter the schema name where RudderStack will create all tables. If you don’t specify any namespace, RudderStack will set this to the source name, by default.\n*   **SSL Mode**: Choose the SSL mode through which RudderStack will connect to your SQL Server instance. RudderStack provides three options - **disable**, **true**, and **false**.\n*   **Sync Frequency**: Specify how often RudderStack should sync the data to your SQL Server database.- **Sync Starting At**: This optional setting lets you specify the particular time of the day (in UTC) when you want RudderStack to sync the data to the warehouse.\n*   **Exclude Window**: This optional setting lets you set a time window when RudderStack will **not sync** the data to your database.\n\n### Advanced settings\n\n*   **Warehouse Append**: This setting is turned on by default - RudderStack appends your incoming Event Stream data to the existing data in your warehouse. Turning it off causes RudderStack to merge your incoming data into your warehouse to ensure 100% non-duplicate data.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> The append operation helps to achieve faster data syncs while reducing warehouse costs. However, note that it may increase the number of duplicates in the warehouse, especially if the existing data is older than two weeks. A common scenario where duplication might occur is when the SDKs retry sending events in case of failures.\n> \n> A merge strategy ensures deduplication but can lead to longer sync times and increased warehouse costs.\n\n*   **Skip User Table**: Toggle on this setting to send events exclusively to the [`identifies`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/warehouse-destinations/warehouse-schema/#schema) table and skip the [`users`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/warehouse-destinations/warehouse-schema/#schema) table, eliminating the need for a merge operation on the `users` table.\n*   **Skip Tracks Table**: Toggle on this setting to skip sending events to the [`tracks`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/warehouse-destinations/warehouse-schema/#schema) table.\n\n### Configuring the object storage\n\nRudderStack lets you configure the following object storage configuration settings while setting up your Microsoft SQL Server destination:\n\n*   **Use RudderStack-managed object storage**: Enable this setting to use RudderStack-managed buckets for object storage.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> This option is applicable only for RudderStack-hosted data planes. For self-hosted data planes, you will have to specify your own object storage configuration settings.\n\n*   **Choose your storage provider**: If **Use RudderStack-managed object storage** is **disabled** in the dashboard, select the cloud provider for your object storage and enter the relevant settings:\n    \n    *   [Amazon S3 bucket storage settings](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/amazon-s3/#connection-settings)\n    *   [Azure Blob Storage settings](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/microsoft-azure-blob-storage/#setting-up-azure-blob-storage)\n    *   [Google Cloud Storage bucket settings](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/google-cloud-storage/#setting-up-google-cloud-storage)\n    *   [MinIO bucket storage settings](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/minio/#setting-up-minio)\n\nSee [How RudderStack stores data in an object storage platform](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/warehouse-destinations/faq/#how-does-rudderstack-store-data-in-an-object-storage-platform) for more information.\n\n## IPs to be allowlisted\n\nTo enable network access to RudderStack, allowlist the following RudderStack IPs depending on your region and [RudderStack Cloud plan](https://www.rudderstack.com/pricing):\n\n| Plan | Region |     |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|     | **<br><br>US<br><br>** | **<br><br>EU<br><br>** |\n| Free, Starter, and Growth | *   3.216.35.97<br>*   18.214.35.254<br>*   23.20.96.9<br>*   34.198.90.241<br>*   34.211.241.254<br>*   52.38.160.231<br>*   54.147.40.62 | *   3.123.104.182<br>*   3.125.132.33<br>*   18.198.90.215<br>*   18.196.167.201 |\n| Enterprise | *   3.216.35.97<br>*   34.198.90.241<br>*   44.236.60.231<br>*   54.147.40.62<br>*   100.20.239.77 | *   3.66.99.198<br>*   3.64.201.167<br>*   3.123.104.182<br>*   3.125.132.33 |\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> All the outbound traffic is routed through these RudderStack IPs.\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### How does RudderStack handle cases when loading the data into SQL Server?\n\nRudderStack converts the event keys into lower case before exporting the data into SQL Server, so that it does not create two tables if the event name has two different cases.\n\n#### How are reserved words handled by RudderStack?\n\nThere are some limitations when it comes to using [reserved words](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/language-elements/reserved-keywords-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver15) in a schema, table, or column names. If such words are used as event names, traits or properties, they will be prefixed with a `_` when RudderStack creates tables or columns for them in your schema.\n\nAlso, it is important to note that integers are not allowed at the start of the schema or table name. Hence, RudderStack prefixes such schema, column or table names with a `_`.\n\nFor instance, `'25dollarpurchase'` will be changed by RudderStack to `'_25dollarpurchase`'.\n\n#### What are the SSL mode options provided by RudderStack?\n\nWhile setting up the SQL Server destination, RudderStack provides the following three SSL options:\n\n*   **disable**: The data sent from RudderStack to your database is not encrypted.\n*   **false**: The data sent from RudderStack to your database is not encrypted beyond the login packet.\n*   **true**: The data sent from RudderStack to your database is encrypted.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> For a more comprehensive FAQ list, refer to the [Warehouse FAQ](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/warehouse-destinations/faq/) guide.\n\nQuestions?

    "markdown": "# Use Transformations in Cloud, Device, and Hybrid Mode\n\nUse transformations with destinations connected in cloud, device, and device mode.\n\n* * *\n\n*     10 minute read  \n    \n\nThis guide explains how to use transformations with destinations connected in different RudderStack [connection modes](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/).\n\n## Transform a single event\n\nWhile using a transformation, RudderStack applies the `transformEvent` function on each event that takes the following two arguments:\n\n| Argument | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `event` | The input event. |\n| `metadata` | The JavaScript function to access the event’s metadata. See the [Access event metadata](#access-event-metadata) section below for more information. |\n\nAfter the transformation is complete, the `transformEvent` function returns the final event to be sent to the destination.\n\n#### Access event metadata\n\nRudderStack injects a function `metadata(event)` into your transformations as an argument. This lets you access the event metadata variables to customize your transformations.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> `metadata()` takes the event as the input and returns the metadata of the event.\n\nThe following properties, if available, are present in the metadata response:\n\n| Property | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `sourceId` | The source ID in the [Settings](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/dashboard-guides/sources/#source-details) tab of your source configured in the RudderStack dashboard. |\n| `sourceName` | The source name set in the RudderStack dashboard. For example, `JavaScript-QA`, `TestJSSource`, etc. |\n| `destinationId` | The destination ID in the [Settings](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/dashboard-guides/destinations/#destination-details) tab of your destination configured in the RudderStack dashboard. |\n| `messageId` | The unique ID for each event. |\n| `sourceType` | The source type, for example, Android, iOS. |\n| `destinationType` | The destination type where RudderStack sends the transformed event, for example, Snowflake. |\n\nExample transformations using the `metadata` data method are shown below:\n\n```\nexport function transformEvent(event, metadata) {\n  const meta = metadata(event);\n  event.sourceId = meta.sourceId;\n\n  return event;\n}\n```\n\n```\ndef transformEvent(event, metadata):\n    meta = metadata(event)\n    event['sourceId'] = meta['sourceId']\n    return event\n```\n\n#### Make external API requests\n\nYou can make any number of external API requests in your transformation functions and use the fetched responses to enrich your events.\n\n##### JavaScript\n\nRudderStack injects an asynchronous `fetch` function in your transformations. It makes an API call to the given URL and returns the response in the JSON format.\n\nYou can use the `fetch` function in your transformations:\n\n```\nexport async function transformEvent(event, metadata) {\n  const res = await fetch(\"post_url\", {\n    method: \"POST\",  // POST, PUT, DELETE, GET, etc.\n    headers: {\n      \"Content-Type\": \"application/json;charset=UTF-8\",\n      Authorization: \"Bearer <authorization_token>\"\n    },\n    body: JSON.stringify(event)\n  });\n  event.response = JSON.stringify(res);\n  return event;\n}\n```\n\nTo see the `fetch` function in action, refer to the [Clearbit enrichment](https://github.com/rudderlabs/sample-user-transformers/blob/sampleTransformationV1/EnrichWithClearbit.js) example.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> For improved performance, it is highly recommended to use the `batch` API requests wherever possible instead of a separate API request for each event.\n\n##### Fetch v2\n\n`fetchv2` is a wrapper for the `fetch` call. It enables you to fetch the response properties more efficiently while making the external API calls.\n\nThe `fetchv2` response contains the following properties:\n\n| Property | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `status` | Status code of fetch response, for example, `200`. |\n| `url` | The URL of the Fetch API. |\n| `headers` | The response headers |\n| `body` | The response body in JSON or TEXT. By default, it is JSON. |\n\nThe following example highlights the use of the `fetchV2` function in a transformation to capture failure due to a timeout:\n\n```\nexport async function transformEvent(event) {\n  try {\n    const res = await fetchV2(\"url\", { timeout: 1000});\n    if (res.status == 200) {\n      event.response = JSON.stringify(res.body);\n    }\n  } catch (err) {\n    log(err.message);\n  }\n  return event;\n}\n```\n\n#### Python\n\nYou can use Python’s `requests` package to fetch response properties while making the external API calls:\n\n```\nimport requests\n\ndef transformEvent(event, metadata):\n    res = requests.get(\"url\")\n    if res.status_code == 200:\n        event[\"response\"] = res.json();\n    return event\n```\n\n## Transform batch of events\n\nYou can perform any aggregation or roll-up operation on a batch of events using the `transformBatch` function instead of [`transformEvent`](#apply-transformation-on-single-event) function:\n\n```\nexport function transformBatch(events, metadata) {\n    return events;\n}\n```\n\n```\ndef transformBatch(events, metadata):\n    return events\n```\n\n> ![danger](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/danger.svg)\n> \n> To ensure event ordering when using the `transformBatch` function, make sure you pass the `messageId` from the input event to the output event. Without the `messageId`, RudderStack **does not** guarantee event ordering.\n> \n> **It is highly recommended to use `transformEvent` as much as possible, as it ensures event ordering.**\n\n## Cloud mode\n\nWhen you [add a transformation](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/transformations/create/#adding-a-transformation) and connect it to a destination in cloud mode, RudderStack does the following:\n\n1.  Tracks and collects events at the source.\n2.  Applies the user transformation logic to your events.\n3.  Transforms the events in the destination-specific format. This is done [internally](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/resources/rudderstack-architecture/#transformation-module) and requires no user intervention.\n4.  Forwards the transformed events to your destination.\n\n[![Transformations workflow](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/features/transformations-workflow-new.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/features/transformations-workflow-new.webp)\n\n### Connect cloud mode destination\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> You can connect only one transformation to a destination. However, one transformation can be used by multiple destinations.\n\nThere are two ways to connect a transformation to a destination:\n\n#### **From transformation**\n\n1.  Click the **Connections** tab of your transformation and click **Connect Destination**. You will see a list of **all** the destinations and the transformations connected to them.\n2.  Scroll to the destination you want to connect to the transformation and click **Connect**.\n\n[![Connecting a transformation to a destination](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/features/transformations/adding-transformation-destination.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/features/transformations/adding-transformation-destination.webp)\n\n3.  Enable the **Connect to transformation** toggle and click **Save**.\n\n[![Enable transformation](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/features/transformations/connect-disconnect-transformation.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/features/transformations/connect-disconnect-transformation.webp)\n\n#### **From destination**\n\n1.  Go to the destination in the dashboard. Click the **Transformation** tab and click **Add a transformation**:\n\n[![Connecting a transformation to existing destination](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/features/transformations/adding-transformation-existing-destination-1.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/features/transformations/adding-transformation-existing-destination-1.webp)\n\n2.  Select the transformation to connect to the destination and click **Choose**.\n\n[![Connecting a transformation to existing destination](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/features/transformations/adding-transformation-existing-destination-2.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/features/transformations/adding-transformation-existing-destination-2.webp)\n\n## Device mode\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Device mode transformations is a beta feature and available for the [Enterprise](https://www.rudderstack.com/enterprise-quote/) plan users only.\n\nYou can use transformations with destinations supporting [device mode](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#device-mode), like Firebase, Hotjar, and so on.\n\nDevice mode transformations leverage our Client Transformation service to transform events, then send the transformed events directly to the device mode destination through their native SDK.\n\n[![Transformations workflow](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/features/device-mode-transformations.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/features/device-mode-transformations.webp)\n\nLearn more about the architecture in the [Client Transformations Service architecture](#client-transformation-service-architecture) section below.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Note that:\n> \n> *   Only the [JavaScript](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/), [Android](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/), and [iOS](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-ios-sdk/) SDKs support device mode transformations.\n> *   You can write device mode transformations only in JavaScript. Python is not supported currently.\n> *   The transformations you use in device mode must adhere to the [RudderStack message schema](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/common-fields/). Otherwise, the event will be dropped.\n\n### Connect device mode destination\n\nYou can enable device mode transformations only from the **Transformations** tab.\n\n#### **Prerequisites**\n\nBefore you set up a device mode transformation:\n\n*   Choose the connection mode as **Device mode** while configuring your destination.\n\n![Device mode option](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/features/device-mode-setting.webp)\n\n*   In some cases, setting up a device mode destination involves enabling the **Use device mode to send events** toggle while configuring the destination.\n\n![Device mode toggle](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/features/device-mode-toggle.webp)\n\n*   You can also change the connection mode after the destination is set up. Go to the destination’s **Configuration** tab and click **Edit configuration**.\n\n![Edit configuration](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/features/destination-edit-configuration.webp)\n\n*   Some destinations support only device mode. See the [destination-specific documentation](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/) for the supported connection modes.\n\n#### **Connect transformation to device mode destination**\n\n1.  [Write the transformation](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/transformations/create/#adding-a-transformation) to connect to your device mode destination.\n2.  Set up your device mode destination in RudderStack.\n3.  In the [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), go to **Collect** > **Transformations** in the left sidebar. Then, select the transformation to connect to this destination.\n4.  Click the **Connections** tab . If you don’t have any destinations connected to it, click **Connect Destination**. If the transformation already has connected destinations, click **Manage destinations**.\n\n[![Manage destinations button](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/features/transformations/manage-transformations-1.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/features/transformations/manage-transformations-1.webp)\n\nDepending on whether the destination you set up (in **Step 1**) is already connected to some transformation, there are two ways to add a device mode transformation to it:\n\n*   If your destination is **not connected** to any transformation click **Connect**. You will see a fly window with these options:\n\n[![Device mode transformation options](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/features/device-mode-transformation-1.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/features/device-mode-transformation-1.webp)\n\n*   If your destination is **already connected** to some other transformation, click the **Edit connections** button to switch your transformation. See [Switch transformation](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/transformations/manage/#switch-transformation) for more information. Once you switch the transformation, you will see the above options to enable the device mode transformation.\n\n5.  Configure the following settings under **Device Mode**:\n\n*   Enable the **Connect to transformation** toggle.\n*   Enable the **Propagate errors** toggle depending on your requirement.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> Note that:\n> \n> *   Under **Cloud Mode**, the **Connect to transformation** toggle is enabled by default. **Do not** disable this toggle as it will not allow you to configure any device mode transformation settings.\n> *   If **Propagate errors** is enabled, RudderStack sends the events to the destination without transforming the events, for any transformation errors. This is helpful in preventing data loss in case of transformation code or runtime errors.\n> *   If your transformation involves hashing PII, enabling this setting will send the untransformed event data in case of any transformation errors.\n\n6.  Click **Save** to confirm the settings and for the changes to take effect.\n\nTo confirm that the device mode transformation is connected, go to the **Connections** tab of your transformation and check the **Connection Mode** column:\n\n[![Confirm device mode transformation connection](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/features/device-mode-transformation-2.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/features/device-mode-transformation-2.webp)\n\n### SDK setup\n\nAfter [adding a transformation](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/transformations/create/#adding-a-transformation) and [connecting it to a device mode destination](#connect-device-mode-destination), you can connect your SDK source to it.\n\nFollow the below steps for setting up the required SDK:\n\nThe detailed steps to set up the JavaScript SDK are mentioned in the [Quickstart guide](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/quickstart/).\n\nInstall the Android SDK following the detailed steps mentioned in [Installing the Android SDK](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-android-sdk/#installing-the-sdk) section. Additionally, use the following dependency in the Android app level `build.gradle`:\n\n```\nimplementation 'com.rudderstack.android.sdk:core:1.16.0'\n```\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> The iOS SDK v2 (beta) does not support device mode transformations. Use the iOS SDK v1 (stable version) instead.\n\nInstall the iOS SDK following the detailed steps mentioned in [Installing the iOS SDK](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-ios-sdk/#installing-the-rudderstack-ios-sdk) section. Additionally, use the following dependency in `Podfile`:\n\n### Tokenization\n\nRudderStack provides the tokenization feature in device mode transformations to add an extra layer of security. The token is available as a metadata in the transformation and you can validate it before attaching with the RudderStack SDK.\n\nA sample code to access the token in the transformation:\n\n```\nexport function transformEvent(event, metadata) {\n  const dmtToken = metadata(event)[\"Custom-Authorization\"];\n  //verify the token\n  ...\n  return event;\n}\n```\n\nYou can use the following methods to attach the token (in the string format) to the SDK:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.setAuthToken(\"my-token\");\n```\n\n```\nRudderClient.putAuthToken(\"my-token\")\n```\n\n```\n[RSClient putAuthToken:@\"my-token\"];\n```\n\nYou can call these methods multiple times.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack clears the token when the user logs out, that is, when the `reset()` API is called.\n\n### Client Transformation service architecture\n\nRudderStack provides the Client Transformation service to facilitate transformations for device mode destinations. It ensures that the event ingestion is unaffected, ensuring minimum response time from the RudderStack backend.\n\n[![Transformations workflow](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/features/device-mode-transformations-workflow-new.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/features/device-mode-transformations-workflow-new.webp)\n\n#### **Workflow**\n\nWhen you add a transformation and connect it to a device mode destination supporting the [device mode](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#device-mode):\n\n1.  RudderStack SDK sends the event to the Client Transformation service. It multiplexes the event for different destinations and connects with the transformations attached to these device mode destinations.\n2.  Client Transformation service sends the event to the RudderStack Transformation service to transform the event according to the functions defined in the attached transformations.\n3.  After the transformation is applied, the transformed event is returned to the Client Transformation service.\n4.  Client Transformation service responds to the SDK with the transformed events for all the destinations.\n5.  Finally, the SDK parses the transformed events and forwards them to the specified device-mode destinations.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> If the request to the Client Transformation service fails, the RudderStack SDK makes three retry attempts. If it fails, the SDK forwards the untransformed events to the destination or drops them - based on the **Propagate errors** toggle while [configuring the device mode transformation](#connect-device-mode-destination) (see Step 6).\n\n### Debugging\n\nCheck the **Network** tab in the browser’s developer tools for any `transform` network requests to debug errors in your device mode transformations. These requests can help you determine if:\n\n*   The transformation has run as expected.\n*   The responses are as expected, based on the sent batch or otherwise.\n\n[![Debugging device mode transformations](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/features/transformations/dmt-debugging.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/features/transformations/dmt-debugging.webp)\n\n### Performance considerations\n\nRudderStack makes a network call for each event (in case of JavaScript SDK) or a batch of events (in case of mobile SDKs) when you use transformations with device mode destinations. Hence, there can be an added performance cost.\n\n## Hybrid mode\n\nWhile using transformations with destinations connected in [hybrid mode](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#hybrid-mode) like [GA4](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/google-analytics-4/), [Braze](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/braze/), [Leanplum](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/leanplum/), or [Rockerbox](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/rockerbox/), you can choose to transform:\n\n*   **Events sent in both cloud and device mode**: By default, the transformation is applied to both the cloud and device mode events.\n*   **Only device mode events**: Access the `mode` field in your transformation’s [event metadata](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/transformations/usage/#access-event-metadata) and check if its value is `deviceMode`. Then, specify the transformation logic to be applied to the device mode events:\n\n```\nexport function transformEvent(event, metadata) {\n\n  const mode = metadata(event)[\"mode\"];\n  if(mode === \"deviceMode\") {\n      //some transformation\n      return event;\n    }\n\n    return event;\n}\n```\n\n*   **Only cloud mode events**: Return the device mode events as it is using the `mode` field and specify the transformation logic for the rest of the events (cloud mode events), as shown:\n\n```\nexport function transformEvent(event, metadata) {\n\n  const mode = metadata(event)[\"mode\"];\n  if(mode === \"deviceMode\") {\n      return event;\n    }\n\n    ... //some transformation\n    return event;\n}\n```\n\n## Limitations\n\nA transformation connected in either [cloud mode](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#cloud-mode) or [device mode](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#device-mode) must follow the below memory and time limits. It fails if these limits are exceeded:\n\n| Parameter | Limit |\n| --- | --- |\n| Memory limit | 128 MB |\n| Execution time limit | 4 seconds |\n\nThe following limitations are applicable when invoking a transformation in device mode:\n\n*   The native destination SDKs might persist some captured data - mainly identifiers and traits. So, in device/hybrid mode, you cannot transform these fields using device mode transformations.\n*   Network unavailability can lead to higher latency than expected while sending the events to the destinations. RudderStack doesn’t lose data due to the network loss and stores the events in the client device until they are successfully delivered to the destination.\n*   The iOS SDK does not support the background processing of an event when the app is closed. However, it sends the pending events the next time the app is opened.\n\nQuestions?

Add new transformation\n\n1.  Log in to the [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/).\n2.  Go to **Collect** > **Transformations** and click **Create Transformation**.\n3.  Choose a [transformation template](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/transformations/templates/) for implementing specific use cases on your event data. To create a transformation from scratch, click **Custom transformation**.\n\n[![Custom transformation option](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/features/transformations/custom-transformation.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/features/transformations/custom-transformation.webp)\n\n4.  Name your transformation. It must contain at least 2 characters.\n\n[![Name your  transformation](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/features/transformations/name-transformation.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/features/transformations/name-transformation.webp)\n\n5.  In the **Transformation** window, select the language to write your transformation. RudderStack provides two options - **JavaScript** and **Python 3.11**.\n\n[![Select transformation language](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/features/transformations/transformation-language.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/features/transformations/transformation-language.webp)\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Note that:\n> \n> *   RudderStack uses [Node.js version 18.x](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-transformer/blob/main/.nvmrc) for JavaScript transformations and libraries.\n> *   Python transformations are available only in the RudderStack Cloud [Growth](https://rudderstack.com/pricing/) and [Enterprise](https://www.rudderstack.com/enterprise-quote/) plans.\n\n5.  Add your transformation function. You can also add other functions and call them from within the [`transformEvent`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/transformations/usage/#apply-transformation-on-single%20event) function.\n\n[![Adding a Transformation](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/features/transformations/add-transformation-function.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/features/transformations/add-transformation-function.webp)\n\n6.  To test your transformation, [import a payload](#import-event-payload) using the **Import event** button. Then, click the **Run Test** button next to it.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> If you don’t import any event and click **Run Test** directly, RudderStack tests your transformation against a default `track` event payload.\n\n[![Import event and run test](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/features/transformations/import-event-run-test.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/features/transformations/import-event-run-test.webp)\n\n7.  To save the transformation, click the **Save Transformation** button at the bottom right.\n\n**Optional**: To switch between the portrait and landscape views for better readability, click the button next to **Save Transformation**.\n\n[![Switch between portrait and landscape views](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/features/transformations/switch-view.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/features/transformations/switch-view.webp)\n\n## Test transformation\n\nRudderStack lets you test your transformations to identify and prevent any transformation errors. With this feature, you can thoroughly test various scenarios and edge cases on your event payloads, and ensure effective event processing within RudderStack.\n\n### Import event payload\n\nTo import a test payload, click the **Import Event** button.\n\n[![Import event and run test](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/features/transformations/import-event-run-test.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/features/transformations/import-event-run-test.webp)\n\nRudderStack gives you the following options to test your transformations:\n\n*   Use sample/placeholder event data within the **RudderStack Events** tab to test your transformations on default RudderStack event payloads. This is helpful when you don’t have any live events in your workspace.\n*   Edit an event payload and save it as a new event. You can then use it to test your transformation.\n*   Use the **Live Events** feature to test your transformations on live events generated from your source.\n\nYou can select any default RudderStack event to test your transformation. RudderStack provides four sample payloads (`identify`, `track`, `page`, and `screen`) that correspond to common RudderStack events.\n\n![Default RudderStack events](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/features/transformations/import-rudderstack-events.webp)\n\nFrom the dropdown, select the source. Then, send some events from this source - they will appear in this window automatically.\n\n![Import live events](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/features/transformations/import-live-events.webp)\n\nChoose a live event and click **Import**. You can then test your transformation on this payload.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> Once you import a live event, all the live events shown in the window are lost. You need to send new events to import a live event again.\n\n### Limitations\n\n*   You cannot import multiple sample events to test your transformation.\n*   The live events contain payloads present at the source. They do not resemble the enriched events you see in the [Live Events](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/dashboard-guides/live-events/#transformations-live-events) viewer in your transformation.\n\n## Capture event information with logs\n\nOnce you [add a transformation](#adding-a-transformation), you can capture any event-related information in the form of logs while testing it. You can do this by including the `log` function in your transformation code, as shown:\n\n```\nexport function transformEvent(event, metadata) {\n  const meta = metadata(event);\n  event.sourceId = meta.sourceId;\n\n  log(\"Event Name is\", event.event, \";\", \"Message ID is\", event.messageId);\n  log(\"Source ID is\", meta.sourceId);\n\n  return event;\n}\n```\n\n```\ndef transformEvent(event, metadata):\n    meta = metadata(event)\n    event['sourceId'] = meta['sourceId']\n    \n    log(\"Event Name is\", event['event'], \";\", \"Message ID is\", event['messageId'])\n    log(\"Source ID is\", meta['sourceId'])\n    \n    return event\n```\n\nOn adding the above transformation and clicking **Run Test**, you can see the resulting log in the **Logs** section of the dashboard:\n\n[![Transformation log](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/features/transformations/transformation-logs.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/features/transformations/transformation-logs.webp)\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> You can pass a string, number, or an object as an argument to the `log` function.\n\nQuestions?

    "markdown": "# Manage Transformations | RudderStack Docs\n\nManage your transformations in the RudderStack dashboard.\n\n* * *\n\n*     3 minute read  \n    \n\nRudderStack provides an intuitive UI to help you manage your transformations. This guide will walk you through the steps to:\n\n*   [Connect a transformation to a destination](#connect-transformation-to-destination)\n*   [Disconnect a transformation](#disconnect-transformation)\n*   [Switch transformation between destinations](#switch-transformation)\n*   [Delete a transformation](#delete-transformation)\n*   [Manage your transformation-destination connections](#manage-connections)\n*   [Manage notifications](#manage-notifications)\n\n## Connect transformation to destination\n\nYou can connect only one transformation to a destination. However, one transformation can be used by multiple destinations.\n\n#### **Connect cloud mode destinations**\n\nRudderStack supports connecting a transformation to a cloud mode destination, that is, destination that supports sending events via [cloud mode](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#cloud-mode).\n\nSee [Connect transformations to cloud mode destinations](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/transformations/usage/#connect-cloud-mode-destination) for more information.\n\n#### **Connect device mode destinations**\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Note that:\n> \n> *   Device mode transformations are currently in beta.\n> *   You can enable device mode transformations only from the **Transformations** tab.\n\nYou can also connect a transformation to a device mode destination, that is, destination that supports sending events via [device mode](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#device-mode).\n\nSee [Connect transformations to device mode destinations](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/transformations/usage/#connect-device-mode-destination) for more information.\n\n## Disconnect transformation\n\nThere are two ways to disconnect a transformation from a destination:\n\n#### **From transformation**\n\n1.  Go to the **Connections** tab of your transformation and click **Manage Destinations**.\n2.  Click the **Edit Connection** button.\n3.  Disable the **Connect to transformation** toggle and click **Save**.\n\n[![Disable transformation](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/features/transformations/connect-disconnect-transformation.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/features/transformations/connect-disconnect-transformation.webp)\n\n4.  Click **Proceed** to confirm.\n\n#### **From destination**\n\n1.  Go to the destination and click the **Transformation** tab. The connected transformation is shown here.\n2.  Click **Remove**.\n3.  Click **Yes, remove** to confirm and disconnect the transformation.\n\n## Switch transformation\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> Switching between transformations affects the data sent to the destination.\n\n1.  Click the **Connections** tab of your transformation and click **Manage Destinations**. You will see a list of **all** the destinations and the transformations connected to them.\n\n[![Current transformation](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/features/transformations/current-transformation.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/features/transformations/current-transformation.webp)\n\n2.  Suppose you want to switch the transformation from `T2` to `Test Transformation` for the destination `databricks destn-1`. Click the **Edit Connection** option.\n\n[![Switch transformation](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/features/transformations/switch-transformation-1.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/features/transformations/switch-transformation-1.webp)\n\n3.

    "markdown": "# PostgreSQL destination | RudderStack Docs\n\nSync data from RudderStack to PostgreSQL.\n\n* * *\n\n*     8 minute read  \n    \n\n[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) is an enterprise-grade, open source database management system. It supports both SQL and JSON for relational and non-relational queries respectively. Many companies in the market use PostgreSQL as their low-cost data warehousing solution in order to deliver efficient analytics and user insights.\n\nFind the open source code for this destination in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-transformer/tree/master/src/v0/destinations/postgres).\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Refer to the [Warehouse Schema](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/warehouse-destinations/warehouse-schema/) guide for more information on how the events are mapped to the PostgreSQL tables.\n\n## Setting user permissions in PostgreSQL\n\nAfter setting up your PostgreSQL database, create a user with the necessary privileges to create schemas and temporary tables in this database.\n\nRun the following query to create a new user in PostgreSQL:\n\n```\nCREATE USER <username> WITH PASSWORD '<password>';\n```\n\nRun the following query to grant permissions to the user to create new schemas and temporary tables in the database:\n\n```\nGRANT CREATE, TEMPORARY ON DATABASE <databasename> TO <username>;\n```\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> You must grant the `CREATE, TEMPORARY` privileges to the user. Otherwise, RudderStack will not be able to export the events to PostgreSQL.\n\n## Configuring PostgreSQL destination in RudderStack\n\nTo send event data to PostgreSQL, you first need to add it as a destination in RudderStack and connect it to your data source. Once the destination is enabled, events will automatically start flowing to PostgreSQL via RudderStack.\n\nTo configure PostgreSQL as a destination in RudderStack, follow these steps:\n\n1.  In your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), set up the data source. Then, select **PostgreSQL** from the list of destinations.\n2.  Assign a name to your destination and click **Next**.\n\n### Connection settings\n\n*   **Host**: Enter the host name of your PostgreSQL service.\n*   **Database**: Enter your PostgreSQL database name where RudderStack will load the data.\n*   **User**: Enter the name of the user created in the [Setting user permissions in PostgreSQL](#setting-user-permissions-in-postgresql) section above.\n*   **Password**: Enter the password you set for the above user.\n*   **Port**: Enter the port number associated with your PostgreSQL instance.\n*   **Namespace**: Enter the schema name where RudderStack will create all tables. If you don’t specify any namespace, RudderStack will set this to the source name, by default.\n\n### SSH connection\n\nSSH tunneling is a method of transferring data over an encrypted SSH connection. You can use it to add encryption to your legacy applications and achieve compliance with regulations like HIPAA, PCI-DSS, etc., without having to modify the existing applications.\n\nRudderStack lets you connect to your PostgreSQL database securely over an SSH connection by configuring these settings:\n\n[![Postgresql edit configuration](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warehouse-destinations/ssh-connection.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warehouse-destinations/ssh-connection.webp)\n\n*   **SSH Connection**: Enable this setting to use the SSH connection while connecting to your PostgreSQL database.\n*   **SSH Host**: Enter the IP address of your bastion host.\n*   **SSH Port**: Enter the port for the above host.\n*   **SSH User**: Enter the username you use to access the bastion host.\n*   **SSH Public Key**: Copy the public key provided in this field and add it to the `authorized_keys` file on your bastion host. RudderStack uses the private key corresponding to this public key to establish the connection successfully.\n\nTo enable the SSH connection for an existing PostgreSQL destination, navigate to the destination’s **Configuration** tab, select **Edit configuration** and enable the **SSH connection** setting.\n\n### Sync settings\n\n*   **SSL Mode**: Choose the SSL mode through which RudderStack will connect to your PostgreSQL instance. RudderStack provides three options - **disable**, **require**, and **verify-ca**. For more information on these options, refer to the [SSL Modes](#ssl-modes) section below.\n*   **Sync Frequency**: Specify how often RudderStack should sync the data to your PostgreSQL database.\n*   **Sync Starting At**: This optional setting lets you specify the particular time of the day (in UTC) when you want RudderStack to sync the data to the warehouse.\n*   **Exclude Window**: This optional setting lets you set a time window when RudderStack will **not sync** the data to your database.\n\n### Advanced settings\n\nRudderStack provides the following advanced settings:\n\n*   **Warehouse Append**: This setting is turned on by default - RudderStack appends your incoming Event Stream data to the existing data in your warehouse. Turning it off causes RudderStack to merge your incoming data into your warehouse to ensure 100% non-duplicate data.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> The append operation helps to achieve faster data syncs while reducing warehouse costs. However, note that it may increase the number of duplicates in the warehouse, especially if the existing data is older than two weeks. A common scenario where duplication might occur is when the SDKs retry sending events in case of failures.\n> \n> A merge strategy ensures deduplication but can lead to longer sync times and increased warehouse costs.\n\n*   **Skip User Table**: Toggle on this setting to send events exclusively to the [`identifies`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/warehouse-destinations/warehouse-schema/#schema) table and skip the [`users`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/warehouse-destinations/warehouse-schema/#schema) table, eliminating the need for a merge operation on the `users` table.\n*   **Skip Tracks Table**: Toggle on this setting to skip sending events to the [`tracks`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/warehouse-destinations/warehouse-schema/#schema) table.\n*   **JSON Columns**: Lets you ingest semi-structured event data not defined by a fixed schema. You can specify the required JSON column paths in this setting in dot notation, separated by commas. **This option applies to all incoming `track` events for this destination**. See [JSON Column Support](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/warehouse-destinations/json-column-support/) for more information.\n\n### Configuring the object storage\n\nRudderStack lets you configure the following object storage configuration settings while setting up your PostgreSQL destination:\n\n*   **Use RudderStack-managed object storage**: Enable this setting to use RudderStack-managed buckets for object storage.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> This option is applicable only for RudderStack-hosted data planes. For self-hosted data planes, you will have to specify your own object storage configuration settings.\n\n*   **Choose your storage provider**: If **Use RudderStack-managed object storage** is **disabled** in the dashboard, select the cloud provider for your object storage and enter the relevant settings:\n    \n    *   [Amazon S3 bucket storage settings](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/amazon-s3/#connection-settings)\n    *   [Azure Blob Storage settings](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/microsoft-azure-blob-storage/#setting-up-azure-blob-storage)\n    *   [Google Cloud Storage bucket settings](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/google-cloud-storage/#setting-up-google-cloud-storage)\n    *   [MinIO bucket storage settings](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/minio/#setting-up-minio)\n\nSee [How RudderStack stores data in an object storage platform](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/warehouse-destinations/faq/#how-does-rudderstack-store-data-in-an-object-storage-platform) for more information.\n\n## SSL modes\n\nBased on your security preferences, RudderStack lets you specify the SSL mode through which you can send the data to PostgreSQL.\n\nRudderStack supports the following three SSL modes defined by PostgreSQL:\n\n| SSL mode | Eavesdropping protection | MITM (Man in the middle) protection | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| disable | No  | No  | SSL mode is disabled. Use it in cases where security is not an issue and you don’t want the encryption overhead. |\n| require | Yes | No  | Use this mode when you want to encrypt your data and can deal with the resulting encryption overhead. |\n| verify ca | Yes | Dependent on the CA policy | Use this mode when you want to encrypt your data, can bear the encryption overhead, and want to be sure that you connect to a server you trust. |\n\n### Using verify-ca to configure PostgreSQL destination\n\nTo use verify-ca as the SSL mode while configuring your PostgreSQL destination, you need to copy the contents of the following three files from your SSL certificate:\n\n*   **Client Key Pem File**\n*   **Client Cert Pem File**\n*   **Server CA Pem File**\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Although you can use an existing certificate to obtain the above credentials, it is recommend you create a new SSL certificate to avoid any issues.\n\nThe following steps demonstrate how you can create a new SSL certificate in [Google Cloud SQL](https://cloud.google.com/sql/) and obtain the above-mentioned credentials:\n\n1.  Go to your PostgreSQL instance in your [Cloud SQL console](https://console.cloud.google.com/sql/).\n2.  In the left panel, click **Connections** and go to the **SECURITY** tab.\n3.  Under **Manage client certificates**, click **CREATE CLIENT CERTIFICATE**.\n4.  Assign a unique identifier for your SSL certificate and click **CREATE**. Your new SSL certificate will be created:\n\n[![PostgreSQL SSL certificate contents](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/dw-integrations/postgresql-ssl-pem-contents.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/dw-integrations/postgresql-ssl-pem-contents.webp)\n\n5.  Finally, copy the contents of the three fields and paste it in the RudderStack dashboard settings as seen below:\n\n[![PostgreSQL verify-ca dashboard settings](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/dw-integrations/postgresql-verify-ca-dashboard.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/dw-integrations/postgresql-verify-ca-dashboard.webp)\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> For other cloud providers, this procedure might vary slightly.\n\n## IPs to be allowlisted\n\nTo enable network access to RudderStack, allowlist the following RudderStack IPs depending on your region and [RudderStack Cloud plan](https://www.rudderstack.com/pricing):\n\n| Plan | Region |     |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|     | **<br><br>US<br><br>** | **<br><br>EU<br><br>** |\n| Free, Starter, and Growth | *   3.216.35.97<br>*   18.214.35.254<br>*   23.20.96.9<br>*   34.198.90.241<br>*   34.211.241.254<br>*   52.38.160.231<br>*   54.147.40.62 | *   3.123.104.182<br>*   3.125.132.33<br>*   18.198.90.215<br>*   18.196.167.201 |\n| Enterprise | *   3.216.35.97<br>*   34.198.90.241<br>*   44.236.60.231<br>*   54.147.40.62<br>*   100.20.239.77 | *   3.66.99.198<br>*   3.64.201.167<br>*   3.123.104.182<br>*   3.125.132.33 |\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> All the outbound traffic is routed through these RudderStack IPs.\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### RudderStack does not create the corresponding PostgreSQL tables when I press on ‘sync’. What do I do?\n\n*   Firstly, check the status of your data sync in the [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/syncs).\n*   Make sure you have set up the [user permissions](#setting-user-permissions-in-postgresql) for your PostgreSQL instance.\n*   Check if your database is accessible to RudderStack by [Warehouse FAQ](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/warehouse-destinations/faq/).\n*   Ensure that all security group policies are appropriately set.\n\n#### How does RudderStack handle reserved words?\n\nThere are some limitations when it comes to using [reserved words](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-keywords-appendix.html) in a schema, table, or column names. If such words are used as event names, traits or properties, they will be prefixed with a `_` when RudderStack creates tables or columns for them in your schema.\n\nAlso, it is important to note that integers are not allowed at the start of the schema or table name. Hence, RudderStack prefixes such schema, column or table names with a `_`.\n\nFor instance, `'25dollarpurchase'` will be changed by RudderStack to `'_25dollarpurchase`’.\n\n#### How does RudderStack handle cases when loading data into PostgreSQL?\n\nRudderStack converts the event keys into the lower case before exporting the data into PostgreSQL, so that it does not create multiple tables if the event name is written in different cases.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> For a more comprehensive FAQ list, refer to the [Warehouse FAQ](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/warehouse-destinations/faq/) guide.\n\nQuestions?

Add transformation library\n\n1.  In the [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), go to **Collect** > **Transformations** and click the **Libraries** tab. Then, click **Create Library**.\n\n[![Adding a library](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/features/transformations/create-library.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/features/transformations/create-library.webp)\n\n2.  Add the library **Name**, **Description** and select the language to write the library function. You can also add multiple functions in a single library.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack supports Python libraries only in the RudderStack Cloud [Growth](https://rudderstack.com/pricing/) and [Enterprise](https://www.rudderstack.com/enterprise-quote/) plans.\n\n[![Adding a library](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/features/transformations/add-new-library.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/features/transformations/add-new-library.webp)\n\n3.  Click **Run Test** to ensure the library code has the correct syntax. A **Test Passed** message pops up once the test runs successfully.\n\n[![Library test passed](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/features/transformations/library-test-passed.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/features/transformations/library-test-passed.webp)\n\n## Use libraries in transformations\n\n> ![success](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/tick.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack provides some default libraries that you can import in your transformations for implementing various use cases like encrypting, decrypting, or hashing PII, parsing user agent, and using the localized version of Apple’s device mode information in your events.\n> \n> See [Default RudderStack libraries](#default-rudderstack-libraries) for more information.\n\nTo use the libraries in your existing transformations, note the library name listed in the **Import library name** column in the RudderStack dashboard:\n\n[![Using libraries in transformations](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/features/transformations/libraries-in-transformations.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/features/transformations/libraries-in-transformations.webp)\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack converts the library name into **camel case without spaces**; this becomes your **library handle** which you can use across multiple transformations. For example, if your library name is `Sample Transformation Library`, then the library handle would be `sampleTransformationLibrary`.\n\nYou can then use the library in a transformation with a simple `import` statement. Refer to the below use case for more information.\n\n#### **Use case**\n\nSuppose you want to filter the events that don’t contain an email address with the RudderStack domain. To do so, you can import a `rudderEmail` function from the transformation library `isRudderEmail`.\n\nThe `rudderEmail` function containing the filtering logic is shown below:\n\n```\nexport function rudderEmail(email) {\n    return /@(rudderlabs|rudderstack)| \\+ruddertest/.test(email);\n}\n```\n\n```\nimport re\n\ndef rudderEmail(email):\n  match = re.search('@(rudderlabs|rudderstack)|\\+ruddertest', email)\n  if match:\n    return True\n  return False\n```\n\nThe following snippets demonstrate how you can import this function in a transformation:\n\n```\nimport { rudderEmail } from \"isRudderEmail\";\nexport function transformEvent(event) {\n  const email =\n    event.context && event.context.traits && event.context.traits.email;\n  if (email) {\n    if (!rudderEmail(email)) return;\n  }\n  return event;\n}\n```\n\n```\nfrom isRudderEmail import rudderEmail\n\ndef transformEvent(event, metadata):\n    email = event.get(\"context\", {}).get(\"traits\", {}).get(\"email\")\n    if email:\n        if not rudderEmail(email):\n            return\n    return event\n```\n\nOn clicking **Run Test**, a sample event not containing the RudderStack email domain is filtered out:\n\n[![Filtering out events using libraries in transformation](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/features/libraries-in-transformations-run-test.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/features/libraries-in-transformations-run-test.webp)\n\n## Import multiple functions from single library\n\nThe following snippets highlight how to **correctly** import functions from a library:\n\n```\n// ---------------\nimport { getLoss } from \"getFinanceData\";\n\n// OR\n\nimport { getLoss, getRevenue, getProfit } from \"getFinanceData\";\nimport {\n  getLoss,\n  getRevenue,\n  getProfit\n} from \"getFinanceData\";\n\n// For default getPrice import\nimport getPrice, { getRevenue, getProfit } from \"getFinanceData\";\n\n// alias imports\nimport getPrice as gp, { getRevenue as gr, getProfit } from \"getFinanceData\";\n// usage: gp(event), gr(event), getProfit(ev)\n\nimport * as GFD from \"getFinanceData\";\n// usage: GFD.getRevenue(ev), GFD.getProfit(ev)\n// for default import: GFD.default(ev)\n```\n\n```\nfrom getFinanceData import getRevenue, getProfit\n// usage: getRevenue(event), getProfit(event)\n\nfrom getFinanceData import getRevenue as gr, getProfit\n// usage: gr(event), getProfit(ev)\n\nimport getFinanceData\n// usage: getFinanceData.getRevenue(event), getFinanceData.getProfit(event)\n```\n\nThe following snippets highlight the **incorrect** way of importing the library functions:\n\n```\n// -----------------\nimport * from \"getFinanceData\";\ngetPrice(ev)\n\n// OR\n\nimport getPrice as gp from \"getFinanceData\";\ngetPrice(ev)\n```\n\n```\nimport getRevenue, getProfit from getFinanceData\nimport { getRevenue, getProfit } from getFinanceData\n\nfrom getFinanceData import *\n```\n\n## Delete library\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> You cannot delete a library that is referenced or imported in a transformation.\n\nTo delete a library, go to **Collect** > **Transformations** > **Libraries** and click the **Delete** button next to the library that you want to delete.\n\n## Default RudderStack libraries\n\nBy default, RudderStack provides four **predefined** libraries which you can directly import into your transformations. Refer to the [GitHub codebase](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-libraries) for the code and implementation-specific details for these libraries.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> Currently, RudderStack libraries are available only for JavaScript. Python support (applicable for [Growth/Enterprise](https://www.rudderstack.com/pricing/) customers) is coming soon.\n\nUse the following structure to import the Rudderstack libraries:\n\nA sample import statement is shown below:\n\n```\nimport { JSEncrypt } from \"@rs/encrypt/v1\";\n```\n\nThe following table lists the default RudderStack libraries and their usage:\n\n| RudderStack library name | Usage |\n| --- | --- |\n| `encrypt` | Used in the [Encryption](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/transformations/templates/#encryption) / [Decryption](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/transformations/templates/#decryption) transformation template.<br><br>Lets you encrypt or decrypt PII, including PII stored in cookies. |\n| `hash` | Used in the [Hash PII](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/transformations/templates/#hash-pii) transformation template.<br><br>Hides sensitive PII like the user’s email, birthday, social security number, etc. You can use either **MD5**, **SHA256**, or **cyrb53** to hash your PII. |\n| `userAgentParser` | Used in the [Parse User Agent](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/transformations/templates/#parse-user-agent) transformation template.<br><br>Adds the user’s browser, engine, OS, device, and CPU-related information to the events. |\n| `localizeAppleDeviceModel` | Used in the [Localize Apple Device Model](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/transformations/templates/#localize-apple-device-model) transformation template.<br><br>Lets you use the localized version of Apple’s device model information present in your event’s `context.device.model`. |\n\nQuestions?

    "markdown": "# Snowflake destination | RudderStack Docs\n\nSync data from RudderStack to Snowflake.\n\n* * *\n\n*     14 minute read  \n    \n\n[Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/) is a popular cloud-based data warehouse known for its speed, scalability, and reliability.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Refer to the [Warehouse Schema](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/warehouse-destinations/warehouse-schema/) guide for how events are mapped to Snowflake tables.\n\n> ![success](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/tick.svg)\n> \n> Find the open source code for this destination in the [GitHub](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-transformer/tree/master/src/v0/destinations/snowflake) repository.\n\n## Setting user permissions in Snowflake\n\nTo enable RudderStack access, make sure you have `ACCOUNTADMIN` or an account that has the `MANAGE GRANTS` privilege.\n\nThe following sections illustrate how to set up a virtual warehouse, a database, a role, and an user in Snowflake:\n\n### Creating a virtual warehouse\n\nIn your Snowflake console, create a `X-Small` warehouse:\n\n[![Create a virtual warehouse](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/dw-integrations/snowflake-create-warehouse.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/dw-integrations/snowflake-create-warehouse.webp)\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Set your data warehouse size as per your data volume requirements.\n\nAlternatively, create a new warehouse by running the following SQL commands:\n\n```\nCREATE WAREHOUSE \"RUDDER_WAREHOUSE\"\n  WITH WAREHOUSE_SIZE = 'XSMALL'\n    WAREHOUSE_TYPE = 'STANDARD'\n    AUTO_SUSPEND = 600\n    AUTO_RESUME = TRUE;\n```\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Set `AUTO_SUSPEND` to ~10 mins and enable `AUTO_RESUME` to avoid any extra costs.\n\n### Creating a database\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> Create a new database to avoid conflicts with your existing data; RudderStack creates its own tables while storing your events.\n\nThe following image demonstrates the **Create Database** option in Snowflake.\n\n[![Create a database](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/dw-integrations/snowflake-create-database.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/dw-integrations/snowflake-create-database.webp)\n\nAlternatively, you can create a new database by running the following SQL command:\n\n```\nCREATE DATABASE \"RUDDER_EVENTS\";\n```\n\n### Creating a role for RudderStack\n\nRun the following SQL commands to create a new role with the required permissions to load your data into the newly created warehouse:\n\n1.  Create a new role called `RUDDER`:\n\n2.  Grant access to the warehouse `RUDDER_WAREHOUSE`:\n\n```\nGRANT USAGE ON WAREHOUSE \"RUDDER_WAREHOUSE\" TO ROLE \"RUDDER\";\n```\n\n3.  Grant access to the database `RUDDER_EVENTS`:\n\n```\nGRANT USAGE ON DATABASE \"RUDDER_EVENTS\" TO ROLE \"RUDDER\";\nGRANT CREATE SCHEMA ON DATABASE \"RUDDER_EVENTS\" TO ROLE \"RUDDER\";\nGRANT ALL ON ALL SCHEMAS IN DATABASE \"RUDDER_EVENTS\" TO ROLE \"RUDDER\";\n```\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Alternatively, you can also create up a custom role and specify it in the [dashboard settings](#connection-settings) while setting up the Snowflake destination in RudderStack. Note that this role must have the necessary permissions for RudderStack to load the data into your warehouse.\n\n### Creating a user\n\nFinally, create a user to connect RudderStack to the newly created warehouse using the following SQL query:\n\n```\nCREATE USER \"RUDDER_USER\"\n  MUST_CHANGE_PASSWORD = FALSE\n  DEFAULT_ROLE = \"RUDDER\"\n  PASSWORD = \"<your_password>\";\nGRANT ROLE \"RUDDER\" TO USER \"RUDDER_USER\";\n```\n\n## Configuring Snowflake destination in RudderStack\n\nTo start sending data to Snowflake, you first need to add it as a destination in RudderStack and connect it to a data source. Follow these steps to configure Snowflake as a destination in RudderStack:\n\n1.  From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), configure the data source. Then, select **Snowflake** from the list of destinations.\n2.  Assign a name to your destination and click **Continue**.\n\n### Connection settings\n\n*   **Account**: Enter the account ID of your Snowflake warehouse. This account ID is part of the Snowflake URL.\n\nThe following examples illustrate the slight differences in the account ID for various cloud providers:\n\n| Account ID example | Corresponding Snowflake URL | Snowflake cloud provider |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `qya56091.us-east-1`<br><br>`qya56091.us-east-2.aws` | `https://`**`qya56091.us-east-1`**`.snowflakecomputing.com`<br><br>`https://`**`qya56091.us-east-2.aws`**`.snowflakecomputing.com` | AWS |\n| `rx18795.east-us-2.azure` | `https://`**`rx18795.east-us-2.azure`**`.snowflakecomputing.com` | Microsoft Azure |\n| `ah76025.us-central1.gcp` | `https://`**`ah76025.us-central1.gcp`**`.snowflakecomputing.com` | Google Cloud Platform |\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> In case of AWS, `.aws` is present in the account locator of some region’s accounts and must be included in the **Account** field above.\n> \n> For more information on account locator formats depending on your region or cloud provider, refer to the [Snowflake documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/admin-account-identifier.html#non-vps-account-locator-formats-by-cloud-platform-and-region).\n\n*   **Database**: Enter the name of the database created in the [Creating a database section](#creating-a-database) above.\n*   **Warehouse**: Enter the name of the warehouse created in the [Creating a virtual warehouse](#creating-a-virtual-warehouse) section above.\n*   **User**: Enter the name of the user created in the [Creating a user](#creating-a-user) section above.\n*   **Role**: Specify the role to be assigned to the above user. If not specified, RudderStack will use the [default role](#creating-a-role-for-rudderstack).\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> Make sure your role has the necessary permissions for RudderStack to load the data into the warehouse.\n\n*   **Use Key Pair Authentication**: Turn on the toggle to authenticate the user via a [key pair](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/key-pair-auth).\n\nIf **Use Key Pair Authentication** is turned on, enter the following settings:\n\n*   **Private Key**: Specify the private key. Make sure to include the delimiters.\n*   **Private Key Passphrase**: Specify the password you set while encrypting the private key. Leave this field blank if your private key is not encrypted.\n\n> ![danger](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/danger.svg)\n> \n> The user authentication will fail if your private key is encrypted and you do not specify the passphrase.\n\n*   **Password**: If **Use Key Pair Authentication** is toggled off, then enter the password for the user specified in the **User** field.\n*   **Namespace**: Enter the schema name for the warehouse where RudderStack will create all tables.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> If not specified, RudderStack sets the namespace to the source name by default.\n\n*   **Sync Frequency**: Specify how often RudderStack should sync the data to your Snowflake warehouse.\n*   **Sync Starting At**: This optional setting lets you specify the particular time of the day (in UTC) when you want RudderStack to sync the data to the warehouse.\n*   **Exclude Window**: This optional setting lets you set a time window when RudderStack **will not** sync the data to the warehouse.\n\n### Advanced settings\n\nRudderStack provides the following advanced settings:\n\n*   **Warehouse Append**: This setting is turned on by default - RudderStack appends your incoming Event Stream data to the existing data in your warehouse. Turning it off causes RudderStack to merge your incoming data into your warehouse to ensure 100% non-duplicate data.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> The append operation helps to achieve faster data syncs while reducing warehouse costs. However, note that it may increase the number of duplicates in the warehouse, especially if the existing data is older than two weeks. A common scenario where duplication might occur is when the SDKs retry sending events in case of failures.\n> \n> A merge strategy ensures deduplication but can lead to longer sync times and increased warehouse costs.\n\n*   **Skip User Table**: Toggle on this setting to send events exclusively to the [`identifies`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/warehouse-destinations/warehouse-schema/#schema) table and skip the [`users`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/warehouse-destinations/warehouse-schema/#schema) table, eliminating the need for a merge operation on the `users` table.\n*   **Skip Tracks Table**: Toggle on this setting to skip sending events to the [`tracks`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/warehouse-destinations/warehouse-schema/#schema) table.\n*   **JSON Columns**: Lets you ingest semi-structured event data not defined by a fixed schema. You can specify the required JSON column paths in this setting in dot notation, separated by commas. **This option applies to all incoming `track` events for this destination**. See [JSON Column Support](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/warehouse-destinations/json-column-support/) for more information.\n\n### Configuring the object storage\n\nRudderStack lets you configure the following object storage settings during set up:\n\n*   **Use RudderStack-managed Object Storage**: Enable this setting to use RudderStack-managed buckets for object storage.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> This option is applicable only for RudderStack-hosted data planes. For self-hosted data planes, you will have to specify your own object storage configuration settings.\n\n*   **Choose your Cloud**: Select the cloud provider for your Snowflake instance. Refer to the following settings depending on your cloud provider:\n\n*   **Staging S3 Storage Bucket Name**: Specify the name of your S3 bucket where RudderStack will store the data before loading it into Snowflake.\n*   **Prefix**: If specified, RudderStack will create a folder in the bucket with this prefix and push all data within that folder.\n*   **Storage Integration**: Use this setting to run the COPY command. Refer to the [Configuring cloud storage integration with Snowflake](#configuring-cloud-storage-integration-with-snowflake) section for details.\n*   **Role Based Authentication**: Enable this setting to use the RudderStack IAM role for authentication. For more information on creating an AWS IAM role for RudderStack, refer to [this guide](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/aws-iam-role-for-rudderstack/#creating-a-rudderstack-iam-role).\n    *   **IAM Role ARN**: Enter the ARN of the IAM role.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> It is highly recommended to enable this setting as the access keys-based authentication method is now deprecated.\n\nIf **Role-based Authentication** is disabled, you need to enter the **AWS Access Key ID** and **AWS Secret Access Key** to authorize RudderStack to write to your S3 bucket. Refer to these [S3 permissions](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/amazon-s3/#permissions).\n\n*   **Enable Server-side Encryption for S3**: Toggle on this setting to enable server-side encryption for your S3 bucket.\n\n*   **Staging Azure Blob Storage Container Name**: Specify the name of your Azure container where RudderStack will store the data before loading it into Snowflake.\n*   **Prefix**: If specified, RudderStack will create a folder in the bucket with this prefix and push all data within that folder.\n*   **Storage Integration**: Use this setting to run the COPY command. Refer to the [Configuring cloud storage integration with Snowflake](#configuring-cloud-storage-integration-with-snowflake) section for details.\n*   **Azure Blob Storage Account Name**: Enter the account name for the Azure container.\n*   **Azure Blob Storage Account Key**: Enter the account key for your Azure container. Refer to these [Blob Storage settings](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/microsoft-azure-blob-storage/#setting-up-azure-blob-storage) section for more information.\n\n*   **Staging GCS Object Storage Bucket Name**: Specify the name of your GCS bucket where RudderStack will store the data before loading it into Snowflake.\n*   **Prefix**: If specified, RudderStack will create a folder in the bucket with this prefix and push all data within that folder.\n*   **Storage Integration**: Use this setting to run the COPY command. Refer to the [Configuring cloud storage integration with Snowflake](#configuring-cloud-storage-integration-with-snowflake) section for details.\n*   **Credentials**: Paste the contents of your GCP service account credentials JSON. The service account should have a role with `storage.objectCreator` access.\n\nSee [How RudderStack stores data in an object storage platform](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/warehouse-destinations/faq/#how-does-rudderstack-store-data-in-an-object-storage-platform) for more information.\n\n## Configuring cloud storage integration with Snowflake\n\nStorage integration setting can be used to run the COPY command. This section lists the steps to configure the **Storage Integration** setting specified in the [Configuring the object storage](#configuring-the-object-storage) section above.\n\nIf you have Amazon Web Services (AWS) as your cloud provider and want to use S3 as your object storage, follow the steps below. You can find the detailed instructions in this [Snowflake documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-load-s3-config.html#option-1-configuring-a-snowflake-storage-integration).\n\n1.  **Create a policy in AWS**: In the following JSON, replace `<bucket_name>` and `<prefix>` with the name of your S3 bucket and the prefix set in the [Configuring the object storage](#configuring-the-object-storage) section above, and create the policy with a name of your choice.\n\n```\n{\n  \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n  \"Statement\": [\n    {\n      \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n      \"Action\": [\n        \"s3:PutObject\",\n        \"s3:GetObject\",\n        \"s3:GetObjectVersion\",\n        \"s3:DeleteObject\",\n        \"s3:DeleteObjectVersion\"\n      ],\n      \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:s3:::<bucket_name>/<prefix>/*\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n      \"Action\": \"s3:ListBucket\",\n      \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:s3:::<bucket_name>\",\n      \"Condition\": {\n        \"StringLike\": {\n          \"s3:prefix\": [\"<prefix>/*\"]\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n2.  **Create a role and attach the above policy in AWS**: Follow the steps listed below:\n    \n    1.  Create a role of type **Another AWS account**.\n    2.  Enter your AWS account ID and enable the **Require External ID** option.\n    3.  For external ID, you can add a placeholder value like `0000`. This can be modified later.\n    4.  Attach the policy created in Step 1. Assign a name to this role and keep the role ARN handy for the next step.\n3.  **Create the cloud storage integration in Snowflake**: Replace `<integration_name>` with the name of your choice and `<iam_role>` with the role ARN obtained in Step 2 and run the following command:\n    \n\n```\nCREATE STORAGE INTEGRATION <integration_name>\n  TYPE = EXTERNAL_STAGE\n  STORAGE_PROVIDER = S3\n  ENABLED = TRUE\n  STORAGE_AWS_ROLE_ARN = '<iam_role>'\n  STORAGE_ALLOWED_LOCATIONS = ('s3://<bucket_name>/<path>/', 's3://<bucket_name>/<path>/')\n  [ STORAGE_BLOCKED_LOCATIONS = ('s3://<bucket_name>/<path>/', 's3://<bucket_name>/<path>/') ]\n```\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Record the value for `<integration_name>`.\n\n4.  Retrieve the AWS IAM user for your Snowflake account as shown:\n\n```\nDESC INTEGRATION <integration_name>;\n```\n\n5.  Grant the IAM user permissions to access the bucket objects in AWS. Choose the role you created in Step 2 and edit the trust relationship as shown in the following JSON:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n  \"Statement\": [\n    {\n      \"Sid\": \"\",\n      \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n      \"Principal\": {\n        \"AWS\": \"<snowflake_user_arn>\"\n      },\n      \"Action\": \"sts:AssumeRole\",\n      \"Condition\": {\n        \"StringEquals\": {\n          \"sts:ExternalId\": \"<snowflake_external_id>\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nNote that `<snowflake_user_arn>` is the `STORAGE_AWS_ROLE_ARN` option seen in Step 4, whereas `<snowflake_external_id>` is the `STORAGE_AWS_EXTERNAL_ID`.\n\n6.  Grant integration access to the Snowflake role you created in the [Creating a role for RudderStack](#creating-a-role-for-rudderstack) section by running the following command:\n\n```\nGRANT usage ON integration <integration_name> TO ROLE \"RUDDER\";\n```\n\nHere, `<integration_name>` is the name of the integration created in the Step 3.\n\n7.  Set the [**Storage Integration**](#configuring-the-object-storage) dashboard setting to `<integration_name`\\>.\n\nWhile sending the data to Snowflake, RudderStack uses an external location instead of a stage in its queries. Hence, the following command listed in the [Snowflake documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-load-s3-config-storage-integration.html#step-6-create-an-external-stage) is **not required**:\n\n```\nGRANT CREATE STAGE ON SCHEMA PUBLIC public to role myrole;\n```\n\nTo leverage Azure Blob Storage as your object storage, follow the instructions below. You can find the detailed instructions in this [Snowflake documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-load-azure-config.html#option-1-configuring-a-snowflake-storage-integration).\n\n1.  **Create a storage account and container in Azure**: First, create a storage account in Azure. Then, navigate to **Storage Explorer** > **Blob Containers** > **Create a Blob Container**.\n2.  Run the following commands to create a cloud storage integration in Snowflake:\n\n```\nCREATE STORAGE INTEGRATION <integration_name>\nTYPE = EXTERNAL_STAGE\nSTORAGE_PROVIDER = AZURE\nENABLED = TRUE\nAZURE_TENANT_ID = '<tenant_id>'\nSTORAGE_ALLOWED_LOCATIONS = ('azure://<account>.blob.core.windows.net/<container>/<path>/', 'azure://<account>.blob.core.windows.net/<container>/<path>/')\n[ STORAGE_BLOCKED_LOCATIONS = ('azure://<account>.blob.core.windows.net/<container>/<path>/', 'azure://<account>.blob.core.windows.net/<container>/<path>/') ]\n```\n\nYou can get your `<tenant_id>` by navigating to **Azure Active Directory** > **Properties** > **Directory ID**.\n\n3.  **Grant Snowflake access to the storage locations**: Run the following command and replace `<integration_name>` with the integration name created in Step 2.\n\n```\nDESC INTEGRATION <integration_name>;\n```\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Record the values for `AZURE_CONSENT_URL` and `AZURE_MULTI_TENANT_APP_NAME`.\n\n4.  Go to the URL obtained in `AZURE_CONSENT_URL` and accept the consent requirements.\n5.  **Grant Snowflake access to the container**: Navigate to **Azure Services** > **Storage Accounts** and select the storage account created in Step 1.\n6.  **Add the role**: Navigate to **Access Control (IAM)** > **Add Role Assignment**. Select either **Storage Blob Data Reader** with **Read** access, or **Storage Blob Data Contributor** with **Read and Write** access.\n7.  **Add Assign Access**: Add **Service Principal** as the security principal type for the role. Search for `AZURE_MULTI_TENANT_APP_NAME` that you obtained in Step 3.\n8.  Grant integration access to the Snowflake role you created in the [Creating a role for RudderStack](#creating-a-role-for-rudderstack) section by running the following command:\n\n```\nGRANT USAGE ON integration <integration_name> to role \"RUDDER\";\n```\n\nHere, `<integration_name>` is the integration you created in Step 2.\n\n9.  Set the [**Storage Integration**](#configuring-the-object-storage) dashboard setting to `<integration_name`\\>.\n\nIf you want to leverage Google Cloud Storage as your object storage, follow the instructions below. You can find the detailed instructions in this [Snowflake documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-load-gcs-config.html#configuring-an-integration-for-google-cloud-storage).\n\n1.  **Create a Cloud Storage integration in Snowflake**: Run the following command:\n\n```\nCREATE STORAGE INTEGRATION <integration_name>\n  TYPE = EXTERNAL_STAGE\n  STORAGE_PROVIDER = GCS\n  ENABLED = TRUE\n  STORAGE_ALLOWED_LOCATIONS = ('gcs://<bucket>/<path>/', 'gcs://<bucket>/<path>/')\n```\n\nReplace `<integration_name>` with the name of your Cloud Storage integration, `<bucket>` with **Staging GCS Object Storage Bucket Name**, and `<path>` with the prefix set in the [Configuring the object storage](#configuring-the-object-storage) section above.\n\n2.  The following command retrieves the Cloud Storage service account ID created for your Snowflake account, where `<integration_name>` is the integration name you specified in Step 1.\n\n```\nDESC STORAGE INTEGRATION <integration_name>;\n```\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> The output of this command will have a property named as `STORAGE_GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT`. Retrieve this property value. It should be of the format `service-account-id@UNIQUE_STRING.iam.gserviceaccount.com`.\n\n3.  **Grant service account permissions to access the bucket objects**: Create a custom IAM role with the required permissions to access the bucket and fetch the objects by following these steps:\n    \n    1.  Log into the GCP console as a Project Editor.\n        \n    2.  From the dashboard, go to **IAM & Admin** > **Roles**.\n        \n    3.  Click **CREATE ROLE**.\n        \n    4.  Enter the title and description for the custom role.\n        \n    5.  Click **ADD PERMISSIONS**.\n        \n    6.  Filter the following permissions in the **Enter property name or value** and add them to the list. Then, click **ADD**.\n        \n        *   `storage.buckets.get`\n        *   `storage.objects.get`\n        *   `storage.objects.list`\n        *   `storage.objects.create`\n4.  **Assign the custom role to the Cloud Storage service account**:\n    \n    1.  In your GCP console dashboard, go to **Cloud Storage** > **Browser**.\n    2.  Select the bucket to configure the access.\n    3.  Select **SHOW INFO PANEL** in the upper right corner. The information panel for the bucket will pop out.\n    4.  In the **Add Members** section, get the service account name from the `DESC` command run in Step 2.\n    5.  From the **Select a role** dropdown, select **Storage** > **Custom** > `<role>`, where `<role>` is the custom Cloud Storage role.\n    6.  Click the **ADD** button. The service account name will be added to the **Storage Object Viewer** role dropdown in the information panel.\n5.  Grant integration access to the Snowflake role you created in the [Creating a role for RudderStack](#creating-a-role-for-rudderstack) section by running the following command:\n    \n\n```\nGRANT USAGE ON INTEGRATION <integration_name> TO ROLE \"RUDDER\";\n```\n\nHere, `<integration_name>` is the integration name you set up in Step 1.\n\n6.  Set the [**Storage Integration**](#configuring-the-object-storage) dashboard setting to `<integration_name`\\>.\n\n## IPs to be allowlisted\n\nTo enable network access to RudderStack, allowlist the following RudderStack IPs depending on your region and [RudderStack Cloud plan](https://www.rudderstack.com/pricing):\n\n| Plan | Region |     |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|     | **<br><br>US<br><br>** | **<br><br>EU<br><br>** |\n| Free, Starter, and Growth | *   3.216.35.97<br>*   18.214.35.254<br>*   23.20.96.9<br>*   34.198.90.241<br>*   34.211.241.254<br>*   52.38.160.231<br>*   54.147.40.62 | *   3.123.104.182<br>*   3.125.132.33<br>*   18.198.90.215<br>*   18.196.167.201 |\n| Enterprise | *   3.216.35.97<br>*   34.198.90.241<br>*   44.236.60.231<br>*   54.147.40.62<br>*   100.20.239.77 | *   3.66.99.198<br>*   3.64.201.167<br>*   3.123.104.182<br>*   3.125.132.33 |\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> All the outbound traffic is routed through these RudderStack IPs.\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### While configuring the Snowflake destination, what should I enter in the Account field?\n\nWhile configuring Snowflake as a destination in RudderStack, you need to enter your [Snowflake connection credentials](#connection-settings) which include the **Account** field, as shown below:\n\n[![Snowflake account ID example](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/dw-integrations/snowflake-account-id-example.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/dw-integrations/snowflake-account-id-example.webp)\n\nThe **Account** field corresponds to the account ID of your Snowflake warehouse and is a part of the Snowflake URL.\n\nThe following examples illustrate the slight differences in the Snowflake account ID for various cloud providers:\n\n| Account ID example | Corresponding Snowflake URL | Snowflake cloud provider |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `qya56091.us-east-1`<br><br>`qya56091.us-east-2.aws` | `https://`**`qya56091.us-east-1`**`.snowflakecomputing.com`<br><br>`https://`**`qya56091.us-east-2.aws`**`.snowflakecomputing.com` | AWS |\n| `rx18795.east-us-2.azure` | `https://`**`rx18795.east-us-2.azure`**`.snowflakecomputing.com` | Microsoft Azure |\n| `ah76025.us-central1.gcp` | `https://`**`ah76025.us-central1.gcp`**`.snowflakecomputing.com` | Google Cloud Platform |\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> In case of AWS, `.aws` is present in the account locator of some region’s accounts and must be included in the **Account** field above.\n> \n> For more information on account locator formats depending on your region or cloud provider, refer to the [Snowflake documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/admin-account-identifier.html#non-vps-account-locator-formats-by-cloud-platform-and-region).\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> For a more comprehensive FAQ list, refer to the [Warehouse FAQ](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/warehouse-destinations/faq/) guide.\n\nQuestions?

RudderStack automatically does that for you by following a predefined warehouse schema.\n\nThis guide details the structure of this warehouse schema and the columns created in various tables based on different event types.\n\n## Schema\n\nRudderStack uses the source name (written in snake case, for example, `source_name`) to create a schema in your data warehouse.\n\n> ![success](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/tick.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack treats the warehouse schema as the source of truth. If you manually make any changes to the schema, for example, add or modify a column, or update a column’s data type, RudderStack honors the modified schema and sends the data to the warehouse accordingly.\n\nThe following tables are created in your data warehouse for each RudderStack source connected to it:\n\n| Name | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `<source_name>.identifies` | Every `identify` call sent from the source is stored in this table, including the properties passed as `traits`. |\n| `<source_name>.users` | RudderStack stores all unique users in this table. Only the latest properties used to identify a user are stored, including the latest `anonymousId`. |\n| `<source_name>.tracks` | Every `track` call sent from the source is stored in this table. It **does not include** the custom properties present in the event’s `properties` but has some standard properties listed in the [Standard properties](#standard-rudderstack-properties) section below such as `received_at`, `anonymous_id`, `context_device_info`, etc. |\n| `<source_name>.<track_event_name>` | All the standard properties and the custom properties for a `track` event are stored in this table. The table name is the event name specified in the `track` call, e.g., `Added to Cart`. |\n| `<source_name>.pages` | Every `page` call sent from the source is stored in this table, including the associated event properties. |\n| `<source_name>.screens` | Every `screen` call sent from the source is stored in this table, including the associated event properties. |\n| `<source_name>.groups` | Every `group` call sent from the source is stored in this table, including the associated event properties. |\n| `<source_name>.aliases` | Every `alias` call sent from the source is stored in this table, including the associated event properties. |\n\nThe following image highlights the warehouse schema and the relationships between the tables:\n\n[![RudderStack warehouse schema](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warehouse-destinations/warehouse-schema.svg)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warehouse-destinations/warehouse-schema.svg)\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> All the event properties are stored as top-level columns in the corresponding table. The nested properties are prefixed with the parent key. For example, an event with properties `{ product: { name: iPhone, version: 11 }}` will result in RudderStack creating the columns `product_name` and `product_version`.\n\n## Standard RudderStack properties\n\nRudderStack sets the following standard properties on all above-mentioned tables:\n\n| Name | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `anonymous_id` | The user’s anonymous ID. |\n| `context_<prop>` | The context properties set in the event. |\n| `id` | The unique message ID of the event. Not applicable for the `users` table, as the field be set to the user ID in that case. |\n| `sent_at` | Captures the time when the event was sent from the client to RudderStack. Conforms to the ISO 8601 date format `yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.SSSZ`. |\n| `received_at` | Timestamp registered by RudderStack when the event was ingested (received). Conforms to the ISO 8601 date format `yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.SSSZ`. |\n| `original_timestamp` | Timestamp registered by the RudderStack SDK when the event call was invoked (event was emitted in the SDK). |\n| `timestamp` | **If not already specified in the payload**, RudderStack calculates this field to account for the client clock skew. The formula used is `timestamp` = `received_at` - (`sent_at` -`original_timestamp`). Make sure it conforms to the ISO 8601 date format `yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.SSSZ`. For e.g., `2022-02-01T19:14:18.381Z`. |\n| `event_text` | The name of the event mapped from the `event` key in the `track` event payload. |\n| `event` | The name of the event table in case of the `track` calls. |\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack automatically converts the property names from camel case to snake case. For more information on the properties captured at the API level, refer to the [RudderStack Event Specification](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/common-fields/) guide.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack reserves the above-mentioned standard properties. In case of any conflict, RudderStack automatically discards the properties set by the user.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack drops any non-standard properties declared at the top level of an event.\n\n## Identify\n\nFor every [Identify](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/identify/) call, RudderStack creates a record in the `identifies` table and upserts the records in the `users` table based on the `userId`.\n\n> ![success](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/tick.svg)\n> \n> In case of Google BigQuery, you can use the views created over the tables to query for unique users in the dataset. Refer to the [BigQuery documentation](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/warehouse-destinations/bigquery/#schema-partitioned-tables-views-and-deduplication) for more details.\n\nA sample `identify` call is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.identify(\n  \"userId\",\n  {\n    email: \"alex@company.com\",\n    first_name: \"Alex\",\n    last_name: \"Keener\",\n    age: 35,\n  },\n  {\n    context: {\n      ip: \"0.0.0.0\",\n    },\n    anonymousId: \"59b703e3-467a-4a1d-9fe6-da27ed319619\",\n  }\n)\n```\n\nThe corresponding schemas created for the `identifies` and `users` tables are shown in the following sections:\n\n#### Table: `identifies`\n\n| Column | Type | Example value | Note |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `id` | String | `4d5a7681-e596-40ea-a81c-bf69f9b297f1` | Unique `messageId` generated by RudderStack. |\n| `user_id` | String | `userId` | The `userId` in the `identify` call. |\n| `anonymous_id` | String | `59b703e3-467a-4a1d-9fe6-da27ed319619` | \\-  |\n| `received_at` | Timestamp | `2020-04-26 07:00:45.558` | \\-  |\n| `sent_at` | Timestamp | `2020-04-26 07:00:45.124` | \\-  |\n| `original_timestamp` | Timestamp | `2020-04-26 07:00:43.400` | \\-  |\n| `timestamp` | Timestamp | `2020-04-26 07:00:44.834` | \\-  |\n| `context_ip` | String | `0.0.0.0` | \\-  |\n| `context_<prop>` | String, Int | `context_app_version: 1.2.3`, `context_screen_density: 2` | \\-  |\n| `email` | String | `alex@company.com` | \\-  |\n| `first_name` | String | `Alex` | \\-  |\n| `last_name` | String | `Keener` | \\-  |\n| `age` | Int | `35` | \\-  |\n| `uuid_ts` | Timestamp | `2020-04-26 07:31:54:735` | Added by RudderStack for debugging purposes. Can be ignored for analytics. |\n\n#### Table: `users`\n\n| Column | Type | Value | Note |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `id` | String | `userId` | The unique user ID. |\n| `received_at` | Timestamp | `2020-04-26 07:00:45.558` | \\-  |\n| `context_ip` | String | `0.0.0.0` | \\-  |\n| `context_<prop>` | String, Integer | `context_app_version: 1.2.3`, `context_screen_density: 2` | \\-  |\n| `email` | String | `alex@company.com` | \\-  |\n| `first_name` | String | `Alex` | \\-  |\n| `last_name` | String | `Keener` | \\-  |\n| `age` | Int | `35` | \\-  |\n| `uuid_ts` | Timestamp | `2020-04-26 07:31:54:735` | Added by RudderStack for debugging purposes. Can be ignored for analytics. |\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Note that:\n> \n> *   The `users` table contains the properties from the latest `identify` call made for an user. It only has the `id` column (same as `user_id` in the `identifies` table) and does not have the `anonymous_id` column.\n> *   To obtain a user’s `anonymous_id`, you can query the `identifies` table by grouping on the `user_id` column.\n\n#### Skip sending data to `users` table\n\nYou can skip sending the event data to the `users` table by setting the `skipUsersTable` option to `true`.\n\nFor example, you can add the following transformation that adds an `integrations` object to your event and skips sending the event data to the `users` table:\n\n```\nevent.integrations = {\n    \"DELTALAKE\": {\n        options: {\n            skipUsersTable: true\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nUse the following names for your preferred warehouse destination in the above snippet:\n\n| Warehouse destination | Name |\n| --- | --- |\n| PostgreSQL | `POSTGRES` |\n| Snowflake | `SNOWFLAKE` |\n| Google BigQuery | `BQ` |\n| Microsoft SQL Server | `MSSQL` |\n| Databricks Delta Lake | `DELTALAKE` |\n| ClickHouse | `CLICKHOUSE` |\n| Amazon S3 Data Lake | `S3_DATALAKE` |\n| Google Cloud Storage Data Lake | `GCS_DATALAKE` |\n| Azure Data Lake | `AZURE_DATALAKE` |\n| Amazon Redshift | `RS` |\n| Azure Synapse | `AZURE_SYNAPSE` |\n\n## Track\n\nFor every [`track`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/track/) call, RudderStack creates a record in the `tracks` and `<event_name>` table. In addition to the `tracks` table columns, the `<event_name>` table includes the properties set by the user via the `properties` key.\n\nYou can also skip sending the event data to `tracks` table by setting the `skipTracksTable` option to `true`.\n\nA sample `track` event named `Add to Cart` is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.track(\n  \"Add to Cart\", {\n    price: 5,\n    currency: \"USD\",\n    product_id: \"P12345\",\n    product_name: \"N95 Mask\",\n  }, {\n    context: {\n      ip: \"0.0.0.0\",\n    },\n    anonymousId: \"59b703e3-467a-4a1d-9fe6-da27ed319619\",\n  }\n)\n```\n\nThe corresponding schemas created for the `tracks` and `add_to_cart` tables are as shown:\n\n#### Table: `tracks`\n\nThe `tracks` table stores contextual information like `ip`, `device`, etc. which helps you to perform analytics-related operations on top of it.\n\n| Column | Type | Example value | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `id` | String | `4d5a7681-e596-40ea-a81c-bf69f9b297f1` | Unique `messageId` generated by RudderStack. |\n| `anonymous_id` | String | `59b703e3-467a-4a1d-9fe6-da27ed319619` | The anonymous ID of the user. |\n| `received_at` | Timestamp | `2020-04-26 07:00:45.558` | Timestamp registered by RudderStack when the event was ingested (received). |\n| `sent_at` | Timestamp | `2020-04-26 07:00:45.124` | Timestamp set by the SDK when the event was sent from the client to RudderStack. |\n| `original_timestamp` | Timestamp | `2020-04-26 07:00:43.400` | Timestamp registered by the SDK when the event was invoked (event was emitted in the SDK). |\n| `timestamp` | Timestamp | `2020-04-26 07:00:44.834` | Calculated by RudderStack to account for the client clock skew. The formula used is: `timestamp` = `received_at` - (`sent_at` - `original_timestamp`). |\n| `context_ip` | String | `0.0.0.0` | \\-  |\n| `context_<prop>` | String, Integer | `context_app_version: 1.2.3, context_screen_density: 2` | \\-  |\n| `event` | String | `add_to_cart` | The name of the corresponding event table. |\n| `event_text` | String | `Add to Cart` | The name of the event. |\n| `uuid_ts` | Timestamp | `2020-04-26 07:31:54:735` | Added by RudderStack for debugging purposes. Can be ignored for analytics. |\n\n#### Skip sending data to `tracks` table\n\nSimilar to [`users`](#skip-sending-data-to-users-table) table, you can skip sending the event data to the `tracks` table by setting `skipTracksTable` to `true`.\n\nThe transformation that adds the `integrations` object to your event and skips sending the event data to the `tracks` table:\n\n```\nevent.integrations = {\n    \"DELTALAKE\": {\n        options: {\n            skipTracksTable: true\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nUse the following names for your preferred warehouse destination in the above snippet:\n\n| Warehouse destination | Name |\n| --- | --- |\n| PostgreSQL | `POSTGRES` |\n| Snowflake | `SNOWFLAKE` |\n| Google BigQuery | `BQ` |\n| Microsoft SQL Server | `MSSQL` |\n| Databricks Delta Lake | `DELTALAKE` |\n| ClickHouse | `CLICKHOUSE` |\n| Amazon S3 Data Lake | `S3_DATALAKE` |\n| Google Cloud Storage Data Lake | `GCS_DATALAKE` |\n| Azure Data Lake | `AZURE_DATALAKE` |\n| Amazon Redshift | `RS` |\n| Azure Synapse | `AZURE_SYNAPSE` |\n\n#### Table: `add_to_cart`\n\nThe `add_to_cart` table has the same columns as the `tracks` table. Additionally, it includes the properties set by the user via the `properties` key.\n\n| Column | Type | Example value | Note |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `id` | String | `4d5a7681-e596-40ea-a81c-bf69f9b297f1` | Unique `messageId`generated by RudderStack. |\n| `anonymous_id` | String | `59b703e3-467a-4a1d-9fe6-da27ed319619` | \\-  |\n| `received_at` | Timestamp | `2020-04-26 07:00:45.558` | \\-  |\n| `sent_at` | Timestamp | `2020-04-26 07:00:45.124` | \\-  |\n| `original_timestamp` | Timestamp | `2020-04-26 07:00:43.400` | \\-  |\n| `timestamp` | Timestamp | `2020-04-26 07:00:44.834` | \\-  |\n| `context_ip` | String | `0.0.0.0` | \\-  |\n| `context_<prop>` | String, Int | `context_app_version: 1.2.3, context_screen_density: 2` | \\-  |\n| `event` | String | `add_to_cart` | The name of the event table. |\n| `event_text` | String | `Add to Cart` | The name of the event. |\n| `price` | Int | `5` | \\-  |\n| `currency` | String | `USD` | \\-  |\n| `product_id` | String | `P12345` | \\-  |\n| `product_name` | String | `N95 Mask` | \\-  |\n| `uuid_ts` | Timestamp | `2020-04-26 07:31:54:735` | Added by RudderStack for debugging purposes. Can be ignored for analytics. |\n\n## Page/Screen\n\nFor every [`page`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/page/)/[`screen`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/screen/) call, RudderStack creates a record in the corresponding `pages` or `screens` table.\n\nA sample `page` event is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.page(\n  \"Cart\",\n  \"Cart Viewed\",\n  {\n    path: \"/cart\",\n    title: \"Shopping Cart\",\n    url: \"https://rudderstack.com\",\n  },\n  {\n    context: {\n      ip: \"0.0.0.0\",\n    },\n    anonymousId: \"59b703e3-467a-4a1d-9fe6-da27ed319619\",\n  }\n)\n```\n\nThe corresponding schema created for the `pages`/`screens` table is as shown:\n\n#### Table: `pages`/`screens`\n\n| Column | Type | Example value | Note |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `id` | String | `4d5a7681-e596-40ea-a81c-bf69f9b297f1` | \\-  |\n| `anonymous_id` | String | `59b703e3-467a-4a1d-9fe6-da27ed319619` | \\-  |\n| `received_at` | Timestamp | `2020-04-26 07:00:45.558` | \\-  |\n| `sent_at` | Timestamp | `2020-04-26 07:00:45.124` | \\-  |\n| `original_timestamp` | Timestamp | `2020-04-26 07:00:43.400` | \\-  |\n| `timestamp` | Timestamp | `2020-04-26 07:00:44.834` | \\-  |\n| `context_ip` | String | `0.0.0.0` | \\-  |\n| `context_<prop>` | String, Integer | `context_app_version: 1.2.3`, `context_screen_density: 2` | \\-  |\n| `name` | String | `Cart Viewed` | The page name.<br><br>RudderStack sets the value of this field to `null` if you do not explicitly declare it in the `page` event. |\n| `category` | String | `Cart` | The page category. |\n| `path` | String | `/cart` | \\-  |\n| `title` | String | `Shopping Cart` | \\-  |\n| `url` | String | `https://rudderstack.com` | \\-  |\n| `uuid_ts` | Timestamp | `2020-04-26 07:31:54:735` | Added by RudderStack for debugging purposes. Can be ignored for analytics. |\n\n## Group\n\nFor every [`group`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/group/) call, RudderStack creates a record in the corresponding `groups` table.\n\nA sample `group` call is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.group(\n  \"groupId\", {\n    email: \"alex@keener.com\",\n    first_name: \"Alex\",\n    last_name: \"Keener\",\n    age: 35,\n  }, {\n    context: {\n      ip: \"0.0.0.0\",\n    },\n    anonymousId: \"59b703e3-467a-4a1d-9fe6-da27ed319619\",\n  }\n)\n```\n\nThe corresponding schema created for the `groups` table is as shown:\n\n#### Table: `groups`\n\n| Column | Type | Example value | Note |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `id` | String | `4d5a7681-e596-40ea-a81c-bf69f9b297f1` | The group ID associated with the current user. |\n| `anonymous_id` | String | `59b703e3-467a-4a1d-9fe6-da27ed319619` | \\-  |\n| `group_id` | String | `groupId` | \\-  |\n| `received_at` | Timestamp | `2020-04-26 07:00:45.558` | \\-  |\n| `sent_at` | Timestamp | `2020-04-26 07:00:45.124` | \\-  |\n| `original_timestamp` | Timestamp | `2020-04-26 07:00:43.400` | \\-  |\n| `timestamp` | Timestamp | `2020-04-26 07:00:44.834` | \\-  |\n| `context_ip` | String | `0.0.0.0` | \\-  |\n| `context_<prop>` | String, Integer | `context_app_version: 1.2.3`, `context_screen_density: 2` | \\-  |\n| `uuid_ts` | Timestamp | `2020-04-26 07:31:54:735` | Added by RudderStack for debugging purposes. Can be ignored for analytics. |\n\n## Alias\n\nFor every [`alias`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/alias/) call, RudderStack creates a record in the corresponding `aliases` table.\n\nA sample `alias` call is shown below:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.alias(\"9bb5d4c2\", \"e6ab2c5e\")\n```\n\n#### Table: `aliases`\n\n| Column | Type | Example value | Note |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `user_id` | String | `9bb5d4c2` | The new ID associated with the user. |\n| `previous_id` | String | `e6ab2c5e` | The previous ID associated with the user. |\n| `received_at` | Timestamp | `2020-04-26 07:00:45.558` | \\-  |\n| `sent_at` | Timestamp | `2020-04-26 07:00:45.124` | \\-  |\n| `original_timestamp` | Timestamp | `2020-04-26 07:00:43.400` | \\-  |\n| `timestamp` | Timestamp | `2020-04-26 07:00:44.834` | \\-  |\n| `context_ip` | String | `0.0.0.0` | \\-  |\n| `context_<prop>` | String, Integer | `context_app_version: 1.2.3`, `context_screen_density: 2` | \\-  |\n| `uuid_ts` | Timestamp | `2020-04-26 07:31:54:735` | Added by RudderStack for debugging purposes. Can be ignored for analytics. |\n\n## Clock skew considerations\n\nRudderStack considers the time at its end to be absolute and assumes any difference on the client-side. Thus, the client clock skew is relative.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> If not specified in the payload explicitly, RudderStack calculates `timestamp` based on `originalTimestamp` and `sentAt` to account for the client clock skew.\n\nAs mentioned in the above section:\n\n| Field | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `original_timestamp` | Records the actual time when the event occurred at the source. |\n| `sent_at` | Captures the time when the event was sent from the client to RudderStack. |\n| `received_at` | The timestamp when the event is received(ingested) by the RudderStack server. |\n| `timestamp` | Calculated by RudderStack to account for the client clock skew, **IF** the user does not explicitly specify it in the payload. |\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> `sent_at` > `original_timestamp` is **always true**. However, `timestamp` can be more or less than the `original_timestamp`. Refer to the cases below for more details.\n\n### Case 1: `original_timestamp` < `received_at`\n\nThe following table demonstrates an example of `original_timestamp` < `received_at`(when the client-side time is less than the time registered by RudderStack):\n\n| original\\_timestamp | sent\\_at | received\\_at | timestamp = received\\_at - (sent\\_at - original\\_timestamp) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2020-04-26 07:00:43.400 | 2020-04-26 07:00:45.124 | 2020-04-26 07:00:45.558 | 2020-04-26 07:00:44.834 |\n\nIn this case, `timestamp` will be **greater** than `original_timestamp`.\n\n### Case 2: `original_timestamp` > `received_at`\n\nThe following table demonstrates an example of `original_timestamp` > `received_at`(when the client-side time is more than the time registered by RudderStack):\n\n| original\\_timestamp | sent\\_at | received\\_at | timestamp = received\\_at - (sent\\_at - original\\_timestamp) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2020-04-26 07:00:45.558 | 2020-04-26 07:00:46.124 | 2020-04-26 07:00:43.400 | 2020-04-26 07:00:42.834 |\n\nIn this case, `timestamp` will be **less** than `original_timestamp`.\n\n## Accepted timestamp formats\n\nRudderStack recognizes only the following subsets of the ISO 8601 timestamp format:\n\n*   `2019-09-26`\n*   `2009-05-19 14:39:22`\n*   `2019-09-26T06:30:12.984Z`\n*   `2020-02-11 04:56:55.175116`\n*   `2019-09-26T06:30:12.984+0530`\n*   `2019-09-26T06:30:12.984+05:30`\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack **does not recognize** any other timestamp format apart from the ones mentioned above.\n\n## Reserved keywords\n\nThere are some limitations when it comes to using the reserved words in a schema, table, or column names. If these words are used in the event names, traits or properties, RudderStack automatically prefixes an underscore(`_`) when creating the tables or columns for them in your schema.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> Integers are not allowed at the start of the schema or table name. Such schema, column, or table names will be prefixed with an underscore. For e.g., `25dollarpurchase` will be changed to `_25dollarpurchase`.\n\nThe following table lists the warehouse-specific documentation references for reserved keywords:\n\n| Warehouse | Reference |\n| --- | --- |\n| Amazon Redshift | [Link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/r_pg_keywords.html) |\n| Google BigQuery | [Link](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/lexical#reserved-keywords) |\n| Snowflake | [Link](https://docs.snowflake.net/manuals/sql-reference/reserved-keywords.html) |\n\n## How RudderStack handles data type mismatch\n\nOnce RudderStack recognizes and sets a data type for a table column, it will not accept any values for the column that cannot be cast to the specified data type.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> The values which cannot be cast are set as `NULL` in the table and stored in the `rudder_discards` table.\n\nThe `rudder_discards` table schema is shown below:\n\n| Column | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `row_id` | The unique identifier (ID) associated with each record in the table. This corresponds to the event’s `messageId` for all tables except for `users` table, where it is `userId`. |\n| `table_name` | The table name where the full record is inserted, like `tracks`, `add_to_cart`, `identifies` , etc. |\n| `column_name` | The column name corresponding to the property to be added. |\n| `column_value` | The discarded column value that caused the data type mismatch. |\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> `row_id` is the column which users can use to join with original table and update it as required. As mentioned in the above table, it is set to `messageId` for all tables except the `users` table, where it corresponds to `userId`.\n\nThe following snippet highlights a sample event whose properties are discarded due to a data type mismatch:\n\n```\n// intial track call using the RudderStack JavaScript SDK\n\nrudderanalytics.track(\n  \"Add to Cart\",\n  {\n    price: 5, // originally a int value\n    currency: \"USD\",\n    product_id: \"P12345\",\n    product_name: \"N95 Mask\",\n    added_at: \"2020-05-19 14:39:22\", // originally a datetime value\n  },\n  {\n    context: {\n      ip: \"0.0.0.0\",\n    },\n    anonymousId: \"59b703e3-467a-4a1d-9fe6-da27ed319619\",\n  }\n)\n\n// subsequent track call using the RudderStack JavaScript SDK\n\nrudderanalytics.track(\n  \"Add to Cart\",\n  {\n    price: \"NA\", // sent as a string in latest event\n    currency: \"USD\",\n    product_id: 789, // sent as int but can be casted into original string data type\n    product_name: \"N95 Mask\",\n    added_at: \"05/25/2020\", // sent as invalid datetime value\n  },\n  {\n    context: {\n      ip: \"0.0.0.0\",\n    },\n    anonymousId: \"59b703e3-467a-4a1d-9fe6-da27ed319619\",\n  }\n)\n```\n\nThe subsequent records created in the `rudder_discards` table for the discarded properties from the second event shown in the following table:\n\n| Row ID | Table name | Column name | Column value |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `a21620be-6502-44d6-941d-78209a386d58` | `add_to_cart` | `price` | `NA` |\n| `1e42b2b3-8b6a-49da-8502-83a8db334375` | `add_to_cart` | `added_at` | `05/25/2020` |\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### Can I change the namespace (schema name) of my data warehouse in RudderStack?\n\nYes, you can. Although the default namespace will be the source name, RudderStack gives you the option to explicitly set the namespace while setting up your warehouse destination. For more information, refer to the [warehouse-specific destination settings](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/warehouse-destinations/) for configuring the namespace in the RudderStack dashboard.\n\n#### Why am I not able to see the properties added at the top level of an event in warehouse destination?\n\nRudderStack drops any non-standard properties (properties apart from the [standard properties](#standard-rudderstack-properties)) declared at the top level of an event. However, you can add such properties in the `context` or `properties` section of the event payload.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> For a more comprehensive FAQ list, refer to the [Warehouse FAQ](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/warehouse-destinations/faq/) guide.\n\nQuestions?

    "markdown": "# Transformation Templates | RudderStack Docs\n\nUse prebuilt transformations to implement specific use cases on your event data.\n\n* * *\n\n*     11 minute read  \n    \n\nRudderStack’s transformation templates provide prebuilt JavaScript functions that you can use to create transformations and implement use cases on your event data. These include data cleaning and enrichment, event filtering and sampling, PII management, and more.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> **Currently, transformation templates are available in JavaScript only.**\n> \n> Python support (applicable for [Growth/Enterprise](https://www.rudderstack.com/pricing/) customers) is coming soon.\n\n## Using transformation templates\n\nTo use transformation templates, go to **Collect** > **Transformations** and click **Create Transformation**.\n\nUnder **Transformation templates**, select the prebuilt template depending on your use case. To write a transformation from scratch, click **Custom transformation**.\n\n[![Choose a template](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/features/transformations/transformation-templates-overview.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/features/transformations/transformation-templates-overview.webp)\n\n## PII management and privacy\n\nUse the following transformation templates to easily apply rules for PII management.\n\n### IP Anonymization\n\nThis transformation changes the last octet of the IP address to zero. For example, the IP `12.214.31.144` is transformed to `12.214.31.0`. This protects the privacy rights of your users and reduces the risk of accidentally disclosing their IP addresses.\n\nThe transformation is shown below:\n\n```\nexport function transformEvent(event, metadata) {\n  const ip = event.request_ip;\n  if (ip) event.request_ip = ip.replace(/\\d{1,3}$/, \"0\");\n  return event;\n}\n```\n\n### Replace PII\n\nThis transformation replaces or masks sensitive personal data, for example, email, birthday, or social security number, reducing the risk of accidentally disclosing Personally Identifiable Information (PII). You can specify the properties to be masked or replaced and define the masking logic in the code.\n\nThe following transformation masks a social security number with zeros:\n\n```\nexport function transformEvent(event, metadata) {\n  if (event.context?.traits?.ssn) event.context.traits.ssn = \"000-00-000\"; // Change property\n  return event;\n}\n```\n\n### Hash PII\n\nThis transformation hashes any sensitive user information like their email, social security number, etc., using SHA256 encryption.\n\nThe transformation hashing the user’s email is shown below:\n\n```\nimport { sha256 } from \"@rs/hash/v1\";\n\nexport function transformEvent(event, metadata) {\n  const email = event.context?.traits?.email;\n  if (email) event.context.traits.email = sha256(email);\n  return event;\n}\n```\n\nThe following templates leverage the `JSEncrypt` library for encrypting/decrypting PII in your events:\n\n### Encryption\n\nThis transformation encrypts any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) including those stored in the cookies.\n\nThe transformation encrypting the user’s email is shown below:\n\n```\nimport { JSEncrypt } from \"@rs/encrypt/v1\";\n\nconst publicKey = `<RSA_PUBLIC_KEY>` // Add RSA public key\n\nexport function transformEvent(event, metadata) {\n  const email = event.context?.traits?.email;\n  if (email) {\n    const crypt = new JSEncrypt();\n    crypt.setKey(publicKey);\n    event.context.traits.email = crypt.encrypt(email);\n  }\n  return event;\n}\n```\n\n### Decryption\n\nThis transformation decrypts the user’s Personally Identifiable Information (PII).\n\nThe transformation decrypting the user’s email is shown below:\n\n```\nimport { JSEncrypt } from \"@rs/encrypt/v1\";\n\nconst privateKey = `<RSA_PRIVATE_KEY>` // Add RSA private key\n\nexport function transformEvent(event, metadata) {\n  const email = event.context?.traits?.email;\n  if (email) {\n    const crypt = new JSEncrypt();\n    crypt.setKey(privateKey);\n    event.context.traits.email = crypt.decrypt(email);\n  }\n  return event;\n}\n```\n\n## Event filtering and sampling\n\nUse the following templates for your event filtering and sampling use cases.\n\n### Allowlist\n\nThis transformation allows events to reach a downstream destination only if a specific property contains certain values.\n\nSome examples of how you can use this template are:\n\n*   Allow only certain event names, like `Product Added` or `Order Completed`.\n*   Send certain event types to a particular destination, like [`identify`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/identify/) or [`track`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/track/).\n*   Send only the events that have a tracking plan linked to the source.\n\nThe allowlist transformation is shown below:\n\n```\nexport function transformEvent(event, metadata) {\n  const property = event.event; // Edit property; here it is event name\n  const allowlist = [\"<VALUE>\", \"<OTHER_VALUE>\"]; // Edit allowlist contents\n  if (!property || !allowlist.includes(property)) return;\n  return event;\n}\n```\n\n### Denylist\n\nThis transformation blocks the events from reaching a downstream destination if a specific property contains certain values. For example, you can block all `Product Added` and `Order Completed` events or block certain event types (`identify`, `track`, etc.).\n\nThe denylist transformation is shown below:\n\n```\nexport function transformEvent(event, metadata) {\n  const property = event.event; // Edit property, here it is event name\n  const denylist = [\"<VALUE>\", \"<OTHER_VALUE>\"]; // Edit denylist contents\n  if (property && denylist.includes(property)) return;\n  return event;\n}\n```\n\n### Event Sampling\n\nThis transformation sends only a subset of events to a downstream destination. You can anonymize the events and select a random subset from the anonymous events; this allows you to work with a small, manageable amount of data in the destination.\n\nThe event sampling transformation is shown below:\n\n```\nimport { cyrb53 } from \"@rs/hash/v1\";\n\nexport function transformEvent(event, metadata) {\n  const userId = event.userId;\n  if (userId && parseInt(cyrb53(userId)) % 10 < 5) return;\n  return event;\n}\n```\n\n## Data enrichment\n\nUse the following templates for your data enrichment use cases.\n\n### Geolocation Enrichment\n\nThis transformation enriches events with the geolocation data using an IP-to-geolocation API. This lets you easily query your events based on the geolocation data, for example, country or city.\n\nThe transformation is shown below:\n\n```\nexport async function transformEvent(event, metadata) {\n  if (event.request_ip) {\n    try {\n      const res = await fetchV2(\"<YOUR_API_ENDPOINT>\" + event.request_ip); // Use your paid IP-to-geolocation API endpoint.\n      event.context.geolocation = res.body;\n    } catch {}\n  }\n  return event;\n}\n```\n\n### Parse User Agent\n\nThis transformation lets you add the user’s browser, engine, OS, device, and CPU-related information to the events. Adding this user metadata to your user events is helpful when you want to perform downstream actions later, for example, filter events coming from mobile devices.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> This template uses the standard RudderStack library [User Agent Parser](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/transformations/libraries/#user-agent-parser) which you can use for your custom transformations.\n\nThe transformation is shown below:\n\n```\nimport { UAParser } from \"@rs/userAgentParser/v1\";\n\nexport function transformEvent(event, metadata) {\n  const userAgent = event.context?.userAgent;\n  if (userAgent) {\n    const parser = new UAParser();\n    const parsedUserAgent = parser.setUA(userAgent).getResult();\n    event.context.parsedUserAgent = parsedUserAgent;\n  }\n  return event;\n}\n```\n\n### User Enrichment\n\nThis transformation enriches the events by fetching user data like location, employment, or social media details using the Clearbit API and their email address. It is helpful when sending events with additional user metadata to various downstream destinations.\n\nThe transformation is shown below:\n\n```\nexport async function transformEvent(event) {\n  const email = event.context?.traits?.email;\n  if (email) {\n    const res = await fetch(\"<https://person.clearbit.com/v2/combined/find?email=>\" + email, {\n      headers: {\n        \"Authorization\": \"Bearer <your_clearbit_secure_key\"\n      }\n    });\n    event.context.traits.enrichmentInfo = res;\n  }\n  return event;\n}\n```\n\nThis transformation lets you programmatically extract the query parameters from a URL. For example, in the URL `rudderstack.com/transformations?publish=true`, this transformation identifies the query parameter `publish`.\n\nThe transformation is shown below:\n\n```\nexport function transformEvent(event, metadata) {\n  const search = event.context?.page?.search;\n  if (search) {\n    event.context.page.parameters = {};\n    search.substring(1).split(\"&\").forEach(parameter => {\n      const [key, value] = parameter.split(\"=\");\n      event.context.page.parameters[key] = value;\n    });\n  }\n  return event;\n}\n```\n\n### Localize Apple Device Model\n\nThis transformation lets you use the localized version of the Apple device model present in your event’s `context.device.model`. It converts the standard Apple device model information (for example, `iPhone 13,1`) into a human-readable format (`iPhone 12 Mini`).\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> This transformation template uses the `localizeAppleDeviceModel` RudderStack library which leverages the device model mappings based on open source information. If you find any discrepancies, open an issue in the [`rudder-libraries`](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-libraries) GitHub repository.\n\nThe transformation is shown below:\n\n```\nimport { getLocalizedDeviceModel } from \"@rs/localizeAppleDeviceModel/v1\";\n\n export function transformEvent(event, metadata) {\n const localizedDeviceModel = getLocalizedDeviceModel(event);\n  if(localizedDeviceModel && event?.context?.device?.model) {\n    event.context.device.model = localizedDeviceModel;\n  }\n  return event;\n}\n```\n\n## Data cleaning\n\nUse the following templates for your data cleaning use cases.\n\n### Remove Null Properties\n\nThis transformation removes all event properties with null values; this is helpful when you want to reduce the number of unnecessary fields generated in downstream destinations.\n\nThe transformation is shown below:\n\n```\nexport function transformEvent(event) {\n  if (event.properties) {\n    const keys = Object.keys(event.properties);\n    if (keys) {\n      keys.forEach(key => {\n        if (event.properties[key] === null) delete event.properties[key];\n      });\n    }\n  }\n  return event;\n}\n```\n\n### Rename properties\n\nThis transformation renames the properties to conform with the appropriate naming convention expected by the downstream destination, for example, `first_name` to `firstName`.\n\nThe transformation is shown below:\n\n```\nexport function transformEvent(event, metadata) {\n  const firstName = event.context?.traits?.first_name;\n  if (firstName) {\n    event.context.traits.firstName = firstName;\n    delete event.context.traits.first_name;\n  }\n  return event;\n}\n```\n\n### Clean Auth0 UserID\n\nWhen using the [Auth0 source](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/cloud-apps/auth0/) to generate events from your website, the `userId` is prefixed with characters containing `Auth0` followed by a pipe (`|`). This transformation removes any Auth0 `userId` prefixes.\n\nA sample transformation is shown below:\n\n```\nexport function transformEvent(event, metadata) {\n    if(event.userId){\n        const cleanedUserId = String(event.userId).split(\"|\")[1];\n        event.userId = cleanedUserId ? cleanedUserId : event.userId;\n    }\n    return event;\n}\n```\n\n## Webhooks\n\nUse the following templates to transform events sent to your webhook destinations:\n\nThis transformation sets the HTTP headers for your webhook destinations dynamically. It lets you set the headers based on the values in your data.\n\nThe transformation is shown below:\n\n```\nexport function transformEvent(event, metadata) {\n  event.header = {\n    Authorization: \"Basic <credentials>\", // Change headers and values\n    header_2: \"value\"\n  };\n  return event;\n}\n```\n\n### Dynamic Path\n\nThis transformation dynamically appends to the URL specified in your webhook destination configuration. This lets you send events to different paths based on the values in your event data. For example, you can send `identify` events to only to the `/users` URL path and the `group` events only to `/organizations`.\n\nThe following transformation appends a `/search?email=${email}` path to the webhook URL based on the `email` property present in the event:\n\n```\nexport function transformEvent(event, metadata) {\n  const email = event.context?.traits?.email; // Change property\n  if (email) event.appendPath = `/search?email=${email}`; // Change property and appendPath\n  return event;\n}\n```\n\nThe following transformation templates are contributed by the RudderStack community:\n\n### Filter Bot Traffic\n\nThis transformation lets you identify and filter events from potential bots by checking an event’s user agent against a list of known bot user agents obtained from [`crawler-user-agents.json`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/monperrus/crawler-user-agents/master/crawler-user-agents.json).\n\n```\nexport function transformEvent(event, metadata) {\n  const lower_user_agent = event[\"context\"][\"userAgent\"]\n  const known_bot_filter_list = ['bot', 'crawler', 'spider', 'feedfetcher-google', 'mediapartners-google', 'apis-google', 'slurp',

timestamp into local date and time based on the user’s timezone.\n\n```\nexport function transformEvent(event) {\n\n  const timeZone = event.context?.timezone;\n  const originalTimestamp = event.originalTimestamp;\n  const locale = event.context?.locale || \"en-US\";\n\n  if (timeZone && originalTimestamp) {\n    const date = new Date(originalTimestamp);\n    const localDateTime = date.toLocaleString(locale, {\n      ...options,\n      timeZone\n    });\n    event.localTimestamp = localDateTime;\n  }\n\n  return event;\n}\n\nconst options = {\n  year: \"numeric\",\n  month: \"2-digit\",\n  day: \"numeric\",\n  hour: \"numeric\",\n  minute: \"numeric\",\n  second: \"numeric\"\n}\n```\n\nThis template lets you extract keywords useful for data aggregation and analysis of text-heavy event properties:\n\n```\nexport function transformEvent(event, metadata) {\n  let message = event.properties?.message;\n\n  if (message) {\n    const punctuation = ['\"', \"'\", \"!\", \"?\", \".\", \"-\", \":\", \",\"];\n\n    punctuation.forEach(mark => {\n      message = message.replaceAll(mark, \"\")\n    })\n\n    const stop_words = [\"i\", \"me\", \"my\", \"myself\", \"we\", \"our\", \"ours\", \"ourselves\", \"you\", \"your\", \"yours\", \"yourself\", \"yourselves\", \"he\", \"him\", \"his\", \"himself\", \"she\", \"her\", \"hers\", \"herself\", \"it\", \"its\", \"itself\", \"they\", \"them\", \"their\", \"theirs\", \"themselves\", \"what\", \"which\", \"who\", \"whom\", \"this\", \"that\", \"these\", \"those\", \"am\", \"is\", \"are\", \"was\", \"were\", \"be\", \"been\", \"being\", \"have\", \"has\", \"had\", \"having\", \"do\", \"does\", \"did\", \"doing\", \"a\", \"an\", \"the\", \"and\", \"but\", \"if\", \"or\", \"because\", \"as\", \"until\",

(bigram) bigrams_counts = {\n        ...bigrams_counts,\n        [bigram]: lower_message.split(bigram).length - 1\n      }\n    })\n    const top_bigrams = Object.fromEntries(Object.entries(bigrams_counts).sort(([, a], [, b]) => b - a).slice(0, 5));\n\n    event[\"properties\"][\"keywords\"] = {\n      \"oneWord\": top_unigrams,\n      \"twoWords\": top_bigrams\n    }\n  }\n\n  return event;\n}\n```\n\nQuestions?

At event level\n\nYou can use the SDK’s `integrations: options` parameter to specify the JSON columns at the event level. Follow these steps:\n\n1.  Configure the SDK to load the `options` parameter by default. See the following SDK guides for more information:\n    *   [JavaScript](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/load-js-sdk/#loading-options)\n    *   [Android](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-android-sdk/#1-passing-destinations-while-initializing-the-sdk)\n    *   [iOS](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-ios-sdk/#1-passing-destinations-while-initializing-the-sdk)\n2.  Include the column path from the event payload in the `<destination>.options.jsonPaths` list.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Note the following:\n> \n> *   Replace `<destination>` with the destination-specific object name. See [Warehouse names in `integrations` object](#warehouse-names-in-integrations-object) for more information.\n> *   The column path in the event payload must be in the `<event_type>.<full_attribute_path>` format. See [Use case](#use-case) for more information.\n\n#### Use case\n\nConsider the following event payload:\n\n```\n{\n  \"type\": \"track\",\n  \"context\": {\n    \"ctestMap\": {\n      \"cnestedMap\": {\n        \"dynamic_property_1\": \"value_1\",\n        \"dynamic_property_2\": \"value_2\",\n        \"dynamic_property_n\": \"value_n\"\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"testMap\": {\n      \"nestedMap\": {\n          \"dynamic_property_1\": \"value_1\",\n          \"dynamic_property_2\": \"value_2\",\n          \"dynamic_property_n\": \"value_n\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe following example shows how to use the `integrationOpts` parameter of the [JavaScript SDK](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/load-js-sdk/#integrationopts) to declare the JSON columns:\n\n```\n\"integrations\": {\n  \"All\": true,\n  \"SNOWFLAKE\": { // Use SNOWFLAKE for Snowflake, RS for Redshift, BQ for BigQuery, POSTGRES for PostgreSQL.\n    \"options\": {\n      \"jsonPaths\": [\"track.properties.testMap.nestedMap\", \"track.context.ctestMap.cnestedMap\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nHere, `nestedMap` and `cnestedMap` are declared as JSON columns.\n\nThe resulting output in the warehouse is shown:\n\n```\n[{\n  \"data\": {\n    \"anonymous_id\": \"e6ab2c5e-2cda-44a9-a962-e2f67df78bca\",\n    ...\n\n    \"context_app_name\": \"RudderLabs JavaScript SDK\",\n    \"context_app_namespace\": \"com.rudderlabs.javascript\",\n    \"context_app_version\": \"1.0.5\",\n    \"context_ctest_map_cnested_map\": \"{\\\"n1\\\":\\\"context nested prop 1\\\"}\",\n    \"context_ip\": \"0.0.0.0\",\n    \"context_library_name\": \"RudderLabs JavaScript SDK\",\n    ...\n\n    \"test_map_nested_map\": \"{\\\"n1\\\":\\\"nested prop 1\\\"}\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2020-01-24T06:29:02.403Z\",\n    \"user_id\": \"9bb5d4c2-a7aa-4a36-9efb-dd2b1aec5d33\"\n  },\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"columns\": {\n      \"anonymous_id\": \"string\",\n      \"context_ctest_map_cnested_map\": \"json\",\n      ...\n\n      \"id\": \"string\",\n      \"original_timestamp\": \"datetime\",\n      \"received_at\": \"datetime\",\n      \"revenue\": \"int\",\n      \"sent_at\": \"datetime\",\n      \"test_map_nested_map\": \"json\",\n      \"timestamp\": \"datetime\",\n      \"user_id\": \"string\",\n      \"uuid_ts\": \"datetime\"\n    },\n    \"receivedAt\": \"2020-01-24T11:59:02.403+05:30\",\n    \"table\": \"tracks\"\n  }\n}]\n```\n\n### 2\\. In transformation\n\nYou can also declare the JSON columns in a transformation.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> You can override the JSON columns declared at the [event level](#1-at-event-level) with the JSON columns declared using a transformation.\n\nThe following transformation applies the JSON column to only `product_clicked` type of `track` events coming from a particular `sourceId`:\n\n```\nexport function transformEvent(event, metadata) {\n  const meta = metadata(event);\n  if (event.event === 'product_clicked' && meta.sourceId === \"source_id\" && meta.destinationType === \"SNOWFLAKE\") { // ex: BQ, POSTGRES, RS\n    if (!event.integrations) event.integrations = {};\n    event.integrations[\"SNOWFLAKE\"] = {\n      options: {\n        jsonPaths: [\"track.properties.testMap.nestedMap\", \"track.context.ctestMap.cnestedMap\"]\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  return event;\n}\n```\n\nAs explained in the above [use case](#use-case), to declare `nestedMap` and `cnestedMap` as JSON columns, add `track.properties.testMap.nestedMap` and `track.context.ctestMap.cnestedMap` in the above `jsonPaths` list.\n\n### 3\\. While configuring warehouse destination\n\nWhile configuring your warehouse destination in RudderStack, pass the required JSON column paths using the dot notation in the **JSON columns** field. You can specify multiple JSON columns separated by a comma.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> This setting applies to **all** `track` events sent to the warehouse destination.\n\n[![JSON column setting in RudderStack dashboard](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/dw-integrations/json-column-dashboard-setting.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/dw-integrations/json-column-dashboard-setting.webp)\n\n### Warehouse names in `integrations` object\n\nUse the following object names for the supported warehouse destinations while declaring the JSON columns:\n\n| Warehouse destination | Object name |\n| --- | --- |\n| Amazon Redshift | `RS` |\n| Google BigQuery | `BQ` |\n| PostgreSQL | `POSTGRES` |\n| Snowflake | `SNOWFLAKE` |\n\n## Semi-structured data usage and limitations\n\nFor more information on working with semi-structured data and the associated limitations in different warehouses, see the following guides:\n\n| Warehouse | Data type | Reference |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Redshift | SUPER | [Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/r_SUPER_type.html) |\n| BigQuery | STRING<br><br>(More information on how RudderStack treats the JSON columns as strings in this [FAQ](#how-can-i-use-the-json-column-feature-in-bigquery)) | [Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/json_functions) |\n| PostgreSQL | JSONB | [Documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype-json.html) |\n| Snowflake | VARIANT | [Documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/data-types-semistructured.html#variant) |\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### Which events are supported in the JSON column feature?\n\nThe JSON column feature supports all the event types ([`identify`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/identify/), [`track`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/track/), [`page`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/page/), [`screen`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/screen/), [`group`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/group/)) and their associated attributes/properties. It also supports data from the [Cloud Extract](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/extract/) sources.\n\n#### Which data types are supported in the JSON column feature?\n\nThe JSON data type includes String, Integers, Float, Arrays, Booleans, and Maps.\n\n#### How can I use the JSON column feature in BigQuery?\n\nGoogle BigQuery has released JSON support only as a preview feature. Hence, RudderStack treats the JSON columns as strings and inserts the JSON strings as values. You can then query the semi-structured data using the JSON functions.\n\nFor more information, see [BigQuery documentation](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/json_functions).\n\n#### How does RudderStack determine the column data type?\n\nRudderStack determines the column data type based on its value in the first event (during the first upload sync).\n\nFor example, suppose `column_x` is received with the value as `1`. RudderStack then sets the data type of this column as `int` in the event table.\n\n#### Can I change an existing data type for a column?\n\nYou can change the column data type in the warehouse at any point. However, RudderStack applies the changes to the events only from the next sync.\n\nTo set your preferred data type for a particular column:\n\n1.  Create a column in the warehouse with a placeholder name and the required data type.\n2.  Cast the data from the original column and load it into the placeholder column.\n3.  Drop the original column.\n4.  Rename the placeholder column to the original column name.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> Note that:\n> \n> *   During steps 3 and 4, the tables will be in a locked state. This might impact realtime data uploads/syncs.\n> *   If the above steps take too long to complete, you can halt the warehouse operations in the interim. For more information, see this [FAQ](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/warehouse-destinations/faq/#how-do-i-avoid-lags-in-data-syncs-while-heavy-loads-are-running-on-my-data-warehouse).\n\nQuestions?

    "markdown": "# Warehouse destinations FAQ | RudderStack Docs\n\nCommonly-asked questions related to RudderStack data warehouse destinations.\n\n* * *\n\n*     17 minute read  \n    \n\n## IP allowlist\n\n#### Which RudderStack IPs should I allowlist?\n\nTo enable network access to RudderStack, allowlist the following RudderStack IPs depending on your region and [RudderStack Cloud plan](https://www.rudderstack.com/pricing):\n\n| Plan | Region |     |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|     | **<br><br>US<br><br>** | **<br><br>EU<br><br>** |\n| Free, Starter, and Growth | *   3.216.35.97<br>*   18.214.35.254<br>*   23.20.96.9<br>*   34.198.90.241<br>*   34.211.241.254<br>*   52.38.160.231<br>*   54.147.40.62 | *   3.123.104.182<br>*   3.125.132.33<br>*   18.198.90.215<br>*   18.196.167.201 |\n| Enterprise | *   3.216.35.97<br>*   34.198.90.241<br>*   44.236.60.231<br>*   54.147.40.62<br>*   100.20.239.77 | *   3.66.99.198<br>*   3.64.201.167<br>*   3.123.104.182<br>*   3.125.132.33 |\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> All the outbound traffic is routed through these RudderStack IPs.\n\n## Data syncs and retries\n\n#### When does RudderStack load data into the warehouse destination?\n\nRudderStack lets you choose how frequently it should sync the data into the data warehouse. The default time is 30 minutes. However, you can choose to extend this value up to 24 hours. You can also configure the time of the day when RudderStack loads the data.\n\n#### Is there a way to force load my data into the warehouse?\n\nYes, there is - you can configure the below values in your `config.yaml` file:\n\n```\nwarehouseSyncFreqIgnore = true #if set true this will ignore syncFrequency and syncStartingAt values which are configured in UI. By default this is false\nuploadFreqInS=1800 #This field lets you control syncPeriod if above field set to true \n```\n\n#### Where can I view the status of my data sync?\n\nYou can view the warehouse upload status in the [Live Events](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/dashboard-guides/live-events/#destination-live-events) section of the destination in the RudderStack dashboard.\n\n#### How do I set frequency of syncs for a warehouse destination?\n\n1.  Go to the warehouse destination settings in the [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/).\n2.  Look for the **Sync Frequency** option.\n3.  Specify how often RudderStack should sync data to your warehouse destination.\n\nTo set a particular time of the day (in UTC) when RudderStack syncs data to the warehouse, you can specify the **Sync Starting At** option.\n\n#### What happens if the cluster or the destination service is down? Is there a possibility of data loss?\n\nIf a warehouse destination is down or unavailable, RudderStack will continue to retry sending the events (on an exponential backoff basis, for up to 3 hours).\n\nRudderStack stores the syncs as staging files and retries sending them at a later time when the cluster is up again. This allows for a successful delivery without any missing data.\n\n#### Does RudderStack keep retrying sending events indefinitely? How long can a service be down without losing any data?\n\nAfter retrying for up to 3 hours, RudderStack marks the syncs as aborted. Once the service is up and running again, you can go to the [Syncs](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/dashboard-guides/overview/#syncs) tab in the RudderStack dashboard and retry sending the data.\n\n#### Is there a scenario where I can lose my data without the ability to retry syncs?\n\nRudderStack stores the data in the form of staging files in the object storage associated with the warehouse destination. Usually, the data is stored in the bucket for 30 days. **However, it completely depends on the retention policy you have set for the bucket.**\n\n#### Can I tie a value in the rudder\\_discards table back to the actual event in another table?\n\nYes, you can.\n\nThe [`rudder_discards`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/warehouse-destinations/warehouse-schema/#how-rudderstack-handles-data-type-mismatch) table contains columns like `row_id` (corresponding to the event’s `messageId`), `table_name`, `column_name`, and `column_value`.\n\nYou can use the `table_name` and map the `row_id` to the `id` column in your event’s table.\n\n#### Will the data syncs run in parallel if I connect two or more sources to a single warehouse destination (having the same namespace/schema name)?\n\nNo, the data syncs run sequentially. This is because some destinations like Amazon Redshift and Databricks do not support writing to the same table concurrently, resulting in aborted syncs.\n\n## Staging and object storage\n\n#### How does RudderStack store data in an object storage platform?\n\nRudderStack stores the data in an object storage platform as follows:\n\n1.  Collects all the events in a single node and writes them into a **staging file** that is created every 30 seconds.\n2.  Collects all the staging files and creates table-specific files every 30 minutes (or user-defined frequency). These files are called the **load files** and RudderStack copies them directly into the warehouse.\n\n#### What is the file storage format for staging and load files in different object storage platforms?\n\n*   The **staging files** store data in the compressed JSON gzip (json.gz) format in all the object storage platforms ([Amazon S3](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/amazon-s3/), [Azure Blob Storage](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/microsoft-azure-blob-storage/), [Google Cloud Storage](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/google-cloud-storage/), [MinIo](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/minio/), [DigitalOcean Spaces](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/digitalocean-spaces/)).\n*   The **load files** store data in the following file format:\n\n| Warehouse destination | File format |\n| --- | --- |\n| Amazon S3 data lake  <br>Google Cloud Storage data lake  <br>Azure data lake  <br>Databricks Delta Lake | Parquet (parquet) |\n| Microsoft SQL Server  <br>Azure Synapse  <br>Snowflake  <br>Amazon Redshift  <br>PostgreSQL  <br>ClickHouse | Compressed CSV gzip (csv.gz) |\n| Google BigQuery | Compressed JSON gzip (json.gz) |\n\n#### What are the files written in the location `<namespace>/rudder-warehouse-staging-logs/`?\n\nRudderStack collects all unprocessed data flowing to the warehouse destinations as staging files. It stores these files in the object storage at the location `<namespace>/rudder-warehouse-staging-logs/`.\n\nOnce the staging files are processed, RudderStack separates them by the event name and sends them to the specified destination.\n\n#### How can I delete the staging files in my buckets?\n\nRudderStack loads all events configured with your warehouse into staging buckets. You can set a retention policy to delete these files from the staging bucket after a certain time. If you do not set any retention policy, the files will keep on accumulating.\n\nMake sure that the retention policy duration is longer than the warehouse sync frequency duration so that RudderStack can re-run event uploads for a longer time, if required. It is recommended to set the retention policy duration to **30 days/1 month**.\n\n#### Can I grant RudderStack limited access to the Azure Storage resources?\n\nYes, you can enable the **Use shared access signature (SAS) Tokens** setting while configuring your Blob Storage in the dashboard settings:\n\n[![Azure Blob Storage SAS token](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/dw-integrations/azure-sas-token.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/dw-integrations/azure-sas-token.webp)\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> For more information on the shared access signatures (SAS) and setting the required permissions, refer to the [SAS token permissions](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/microsoft-azure-blob-storage/#sas-token-permissions) section.\n\n## Optimizing syncs\n\n#### How do I avoid lags in data syncs while heavy loads are running on my data warehouse?\n\nYou can use either of the following approaches to avoid data sync lags in your warehouse:\n\n*   **Approach 1**: In the warehouse destination connection settings, set an **exclusion window** which lets you set a start and end time when RudderStack will not sync data to your warehouse. You can run heavy loads during this time interval.\n\n[![](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warehouse-destinations/exclusion-window.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warehouse-destinations/exclusion-window.webp)\n\n*   **Approach 2**: In the warehouse destination connection settings, your can increase the **sync frequency** interval so that there are lesser number of warehouse syncs throughout the day. You can also run the data syncs during the non-peak hours by setting the **Sync Starting At** time interval.\n\n[![](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warehouse-destinations/sync-frequency.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warehouse-destinations/sync-frequency.webp)\n\n*   **Approach 3**: If you are performing only writes/updates on your data warehouse, you can set up a read replica of your database and connect it to your load generation tool. Connect the read/write replica to RudderStack:\n\n[![](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warehouse-destinations/read-write-database.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warehouse-destinations/read-write-database.webp)\n\n#### How can I speed up my warehouse uploads?\n\nYou can speed up your warehouse uploads by configuring the following parameters in the `config.yaml` file in your RudderStack setup:\n\n| Parameter | Description | Tip | Default value |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `RSERVER_WAREHOUSE_REDSHIFT_MAX_PARALLEL_LOADS` | Defines the number of concurrent tables that are synced to redshift in a given upload. | Increase this as per your infra capability. | `3` |\n| `RSERVER_WAREHOUSE_STAGING_FILES_BATCH_SIZE` | Defines the number of staging files that are batched and synced in a single upload. | Increase this to batch more files together and reduce the number of uploads needed for a given volume of data. | `960` |\n| `RSERVER_WAREHOUSE_NO_OF_WORKERS` | Number of concurrent uploads to a warehouse. For example, 8 uploads to different schemas in Redshift can be done simultaneously. | \\-  | `8` |\n| `RSERVER_WAREHOUSE_NO_OF_SLAVE_WORKER_ROUTINES` | Number of go-routines creating load files in a warehouse slave process. | Increase or decrease this as per memory allocated to the warehouse slave pod. | `4` |\n\n#### What happens if I exceed the table column limit in my warehouse destination?\n\nIf you exceed the permissible table column limit in your warehouse, RudderStack will not sync data to it.\n\n#### How can I handle the column count threshold in my warehouse?\n\nTo avoid exceeding the column count threshold in your warehouse, you can use any one of the following approaches:\n\n*   Go to your warehouse and drop the unwanted table columns. Refer to the following links for managing your warehouse column count:\n    *   [Amazon Redshift](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/r_ALTER_TABLE_COL_ex-add-drop.html)\n    *   [Google BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/data-definition-language#alter_table_drop_column_statement)\n    *   [Snowflake](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/alter-table.html)\n    *   [Databricks](https://docs.databricks.com/sql/language-manual/sql-ref-syntax-ddl-alter-table.html)\n    *   [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-alter.html#DDL-ALTER-REMOVING-A-COLUMN)\n    *   [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/alter-table.html)\n\nFor other warehouses, refer to their respective documentation.\n\n*   If you’re syncing semi-structured event data that is not defined by a fixed schema, you can leverage RudderStack’s [JSON Column Support](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/warehouse-destinations/json-column-support/) feature to send the data to your warehouse without worrying about the column count limit.\n\n## Namespace, prefix, and warehouse schema\n\n#### Can I modify the warehouse schema once it is created? Will RudderStack overwrite or discard the changes when updating the schema?\n\nYou can modify the warehouse schema once it is created by adding or altering the columns, or changing the column data type. **RudderStack honors the updated warehouse schema** and sends the incoming data to the warehouse accordingly.\n\nFor example, if you update a column’s data type in the schema, RudderStack will consider the latest, updated column data type and typecast all the incoming data accordingly, before sending it to that column.\n\n#### How is the Namespace field populated for a warehouse destination?\n\nRudderStack sets the **Namespace** field depending on the following conditions:\n\n*   If the **Namespace** and **Database** fields are present in your warehouse configuration:\n    \n    *   For ClickHouse destination, the **Database** field is set as the namespace.\n    *   For all the other destinations, the **Namespace** field is populated as it is.\n*   If `RSERVER_WAREHOUSE_(DEST_TYPE)_CUSTOM_DATA_SET_PREFIX` parameter is present, the namespace is populated as `(CUSTOM_DATA_SET_PREFIX)_(SOURCE_NAME)`. For example:\n    \n\n```\nParameter value:\nRSERVER_WAREHOUSE_SNOWFLAKE_CUSTOM_DATA_SET_PREFIX=\"<some_value>\"\n\nNamespace:\n<some_value>_<source_name>\n```\n\n*   If none of the above fields are specified in the warehouse configuration settings, the source name is populated as the namespace for the first sync and picked up from the cache for all the subsequent syncs. In case the source name is changed, the namespace still remains the same as it is picked from cache.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> To update the namespace as the new source name, you need to configure a new source.\n\n#### Can I change the namespace (schema name) of my data warehouse in RudderStack?\n\nYes, you can. RudderStack lets you change the namespace (schema name) where it loads all the data in your warehouse.\n\nYou can specify your desired schema name in the **Namespace** field while configuring your warehouse destination in RudderStack, as shown:\n\n[![](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/dw-integrations/namespace-example.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/dw-integrations/namespace-example.webp)\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> If you do not set the **Namespace** field, RudderStack sets the source name as the schema name, with some modifications.\n\n#### How can I add the table prefixes if there are multiple sources connected to a single destination?\n\nYou can use RudderStack’s [Transformations](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/transformations/overview/) feature to filter the events by the [`sourceID`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/dashboard-guides/sources/#source-details) and then update the event name to add a prefix.\n\nA sample transformation logic is shown below:\n\n```\nexport function transformEvent(event, metadata) {\n  const meta = metadata(event);\n  if (meta.sourceId === your_source_id) {\n    event.event = '<prefix>' + event.event;\n  }\n  return event;\n}\n```\n\n#### How does RudderStack configure the schema name before loading the data in the warehouse?\n\nRudderStack configures the schema name based on the values mentioned in the below table. The table columns are defined as follows:\n\n*   **Sync**: Indicates whether RudderStack performs the first data sync after the source is set up or the subsequent syncs.\n*   **Namespace**: The **Namespace** field set by the user while configuring the warehouse destination in the RudderStack dashboard.\n*   **Warehouse.<destType>.customDataset Prefix**: The `RSERVER_WAREHOUSE_(DEST_TYPE)_CUSTOM_DATA_SET_PREFIX` parameter in the `config.yaml` file, in case the user has a RudderStack deployment locally/in their own environment.\n*   **Source name**: Name of the source connected to the warehouse destination.\n\n| Sync | Namespace | `customDataset` Prefix | Source name | Schema name | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| First sync | AB  | XY  | S   | AB  | The namespace is given priority over all the other values. |\n| First sync | Not set | XY  | S   | XY\\_S | RudderStack combines the `customDataset` prefix and the source name to set the schema name, if the namespace is absent. |\n| First sync | Not set | Not set | S   | S   | RudderStack sets the source name as the schema name if the namespace and `customDataset` prefix are absent. |\n| First sync | AB  | Not set | S   | AB  | The namespace is given priority over the other values. |\n| Second sync onwards | ABC | XYZ | SS  | ABC | The namespace, source name and the `customDataset` prefix have all been modified. The new namespace is given priority and set as the schema name.<br><br>All the data from the second sync will now be stored in the new schema (ABC) and the original schema (AB) will be left as is. |\n| Second sync onwards | Not set | XYZ | S   | XYZ\\_S | The `customDataset` prefix name has been modified.<br><br>RudderStack combines the `customDataset` prefix and the source name to set the schema name. |\n| Second sync onwards | Not set | XYZ | SS  | XYZ\\_SS | The source name and `customDataset` prefix have been modified.<br><br>RudderStack combines them together to set the schema name. |\n| Second sync onwards | ABC | Not set | SS  | ABC | The namespace and source names have been modified.<br><br>The namespace is given priority and set as the schema name. |\n| Second sync onwards | Not set | Not set | SS  | S   | The source name has been modified. However, it does not impact the schema name and it remains the same as in the first sync. |\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> **Key takeaways**:\n> \n> *   The namespace set in the RudderStack dashboard always takes precedence when setting the schema name in the warehouse.\n> *   If the `RSERVER_WAREHOUSE_(DEST_TYPE)_CUSTOM_DATA_SET_PREFIX` parameter is set in the `config.yaml` file of your RudderStack deployment, RudderStack sets the schema name in the `customDataset_sourcename` format, as noted in this [FAQ](#how-is-the-namespace-field-populated-for-a-warehouse-destination).\n> *   If the namespace and `RSERVER_WAREHOUSE_(DEST_TYPE)_CUSTOM_DATA_SET_PREFIX` parameter, both are absent, RudderStack sets the source name as the schema name.\n\n#### How does RudderStack configure the table names?\n\nRudderStack sets the table names by picking up the event names and modifying them to follow the snake case convention (for example, `source name` -> `source_name`).\n\nFor the following sample snippet, RudderStack sets the table name as **product\\_purchased**.\n\n```\n{\n  \"userId\": \"user123\",\n  \"event\": \"Product Purchased\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"name\": \"Rubik's Cube\",\n    \"revenue\": 4.99\n  },\n  \"context\": {\n    \"ip\": \"14.5.67.21\"\n  },\n  \"timestamp\": \"2020-02-02T00:23:09.544Z\"\n}\n```\n\nThe table name truncation logic is as follows:\n\n*   For **PostgreSQL**, the table name is truncated after 63 characters.\n*   For **Data Lake** destinations (**S3 Data Lake, GCS Data Lake, Azure Data Lake**), there is no set limit.\n*   For **other** destinations, the table name is truncated after 127 characters.\n\n#### How does RudderStack handle schema data type mismatch when sending events to a warehouse destination?\n\nRudderStack automatically handles the data type conversion in some common scenarios **depending on the warehouse column data type**.\n\n| Scenario | Incoming data type | Warehouse column data type | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1   | All data types **except** String, Text, or JSON | String or Text | RudderStack automatically stringifies the incoming data. |\n| 2   | Integer  <br>BigInt | Float | \\-  |\n| 3   | Float | Integer  <br>BigInt | \\-  |\n| 4   | Integer  <br>Float  <br>Boolean | JSON | RudderStack automatically stringifies the incoming data. |\n\nIn any scenario other than the ones covered above, that is, when the incoming data **cannot** be typecasted into the warehouse column-specific data type, it is sent to the `rudder_discards` table.\n\n#### Can I change the name of the table in which my events are synced?\n\nYes, you can add a [transformation](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/transformations/overview/) to change the event name and, consequently, the name of the table in which the events are synced.\n\nAs seen in the above [FAQ](#how-does-rudderstack-configure-the-table-names), RudderStack sets the table names to the event names modified in the snake case.\n\nA sample transformation used to change the event name is as shown:\n\n```\nexport function transformEvent(event, metadata) {    \n  if (event.event.toLowerCase() === '<old_event_name>') {\n      event.event = '<new_event_name>';\n  }\n  return event;\n}\n```\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> Note that this change is applicable to the subsequent events sent to the warehouse destination, after the transformation is applied.\n\n> ![success](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/tick.svg)\n> \n> You can also migrate the previously created table data in the warehouse to the new table.\n\n#### How does RudderStack configure the column names? / How does RudderStack normalize arrays and complex event properties in the warehouse schema?\n\nRudderStack flattens the event properties and converts them into snake case (for example, `source name` -> `source_name`). Further, each of these event properties acts as a warehouse column.\n\n1.  The below example shows how the standard properties are normalized:\n\n```\n{\n  product: {\n    name: \"iPhone\",\n    version: 11\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNormalized properties (Column names)\n\n```\nproduct_name : \"iPhone\"\nproduct_version : 11\n```\n\n2.  The below example shows how the array properties are normalized:\n\n```\n{\n  products: [\n    {\n      name: \"iPhone\",\n      version: 11\n    },\n    {\n      name: \"Android\",\n      version: 16\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nNormalized property (Column name)\n\n```\nproducts: \"[{ \\\"name\\\": \\\"iPhone\\\", \\\"version\\\": 11  },  { \\\"name\\\": \\\"Android\\\", \\\"version\\\": 16  }]\"\n```\n\n3.  The below example shows how the complex properties are normalized:\n\n```\n{\n  products: {\n    iPhone: {\n      version: 11\n    },\n    Android: {\n      version: 16\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNormalized properties (Column names)\n\n```\nproducts_i_phone_version : 11\nproducts_android_version : 16\n```\n\n#### How does RudderStack determine the column data type? Can I change an existing data type for a column?\n\nRudderStack determines the data type of a column based on its value in the first event (during the first upload sync).\n\nFor example, suppose `column_x` is received with the value as `1`. RudderStack then sets the data type of this column as `int` in the event table.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Although you can change the columns’ data type in the warehouse any time, the changes will be applicable to the events from the next sync.\n\nTo set your preferred data type for a particular column, it is highly recommended to follow these steps:\n\n1.  Create a column in the warehouse with a placeholder name and the required data type.\n2.  Cast the data from the original column and load it into the placeholder column.\n3.  Drop the original column.\n4.  Rename the placeholder column to the original column name.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> During steps 3 and 4, the tables will be in a locked state. This might impact real-time data uploads/syncs. If the above steps take too long to complete, you can halt the warehouse operations in the interim. For more information, refer to this [FAQ](#how-do-i-avoid-lags-in-data-syncs-while-heavy-loads-are-running-on-my-datawarehous).\n\n#### Why am I not able to see the properties added at the top level of an event in warehouse destination?\n\nRudderStack drops any non-standard properties (properties apart from the [standard properties](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/warehouse-destinations/warehouse-schema/#standard-rudderstack-properties)) declared at the top level of an event. However, you can add such properties in the `context` or `properties` section of the event payload.\n\n#### Which integration options are supported for warehouse destinations?\n\nThe following integration options are supported for the warehouse destinations:\n\n| Integration option | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `skipTracksTable` | Skips sending the event data to `tracks` table. [Reference](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/warehouse-destinations/warehouse-schema/#skip-sending-data-to-tracks-table). |\n| `useBlendoCasing` | Retains the Blendo column names when migrating from Blendo to RudderStack. |\n| `jsonPaths` | Declares given path columns as JSON fields in warehouse. [Reference](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/warehouse-destinations/json-column-support/). |\n\n## Warehouse-specific settings\n\n#### While configuring the Snowflake destination, what should I enter in the Account field?\n\nWhile configuring Snowflake as a destination in RudderStack, you need to enter your [Snowflake connection credentials](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/warehouse-destinations/snowflake/#connection-settings) which includes the **Account** field, as shown below:\n\n[![Snowflake account ID example](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warehouse-destinations/exclusion-window.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warehouse-destinations/exclusion-window.webp)\n\nThe **Account** field corresponds to your Snowflake account ID and is a part of the Snowflake URL.\n\nThe following examples illustrate the slight differences in the Snowflake account ID for various cloud providers:\n\n| Account ID example | Corresponding Snowflake URL | Snowflake cloud provider |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `qya56091.us-east-1`<br><br>`qya56091.us-east-2.aws` | `https://`**`qya56091.us-east-1`**`.snowflakecomputing.com`<br><br>`https://`**`qya56091.us-east-2.aws`**`.snowflakecomputing.com` | AWS |\n| `rx18795.east-us-2.azure` | `https://`**`rx18795.east-us-2.azure`**`.snowflakecomputing.com` | Microsoft Azure |\n| `ah76025.us-central1.gcp` | `https://`**`ah76025.us-central1.gcp`**`.snowflakecomputing.com` | Google Cloud Platform |\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> In case of AWS, `.aws` is present in the account locator of some region accounts and hence must be included in the **Account** field above.\n> \n> For more information on the different account locator formats depending on your region or cloud provider, refer to the [Snowflake documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/admin-account-identifier.html#non-vps-account-locator-formats-by-cloud-platform-and-region).\n\n#### What are the SAS token permissions required for the warehouse destinations?\n\nIf you’re using Azure Blob Storage as an intermediate object storage for your data warehouse destinations, you will need to assign the following permissions for your SAS token:\n\n| Warehouse destination | Minimum required permissions |\n| --- | --- |\n| Azure Data Lake | Read, Write |\n| Azure Synapse | Read, Write |\n| Clickhouse | Read, Write |\n| Databricks Delta Lake | Read, Write |\n| Microsoft SQL Server | Read, Write |\n| PostgreSQL | Read, Write |\n| Snowflake | Read, Write |\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> For more information on the shared access signatures (SAS) and setting the required permissions, refer to the [SAS token permissions](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/microsoft-azure-blob-storage/#sas-token-permissions) section.\n\n## Event deduplication\n\n#### What is event duplication?\n\nAs RudderStack receives events from different sources, sometimes there is a likelyhood of the response (ACK) is missed due to some network issue. In this case, although RudderStack receives and persists an event as a job, the client doesn’t know if that’s the case and it retries sending the event. This leads to event duplication.\n\n#### How does RudderStack handle deduplication in different warehouses?\n\nFor warehouse destinations, RudderStack relies on the event’s `messageId` for deduplication. For cloud sources, instead of `messageId`, RudderStack uses a property called `recordId` for deduplicating events in the warehouse destination.\n\nOnce RudderStack has the dedup key(`messageId`/`recordId`), it deduplicates events as below:\n\n**For Snowflake and Delta Lake** RudderStack loads all the data into a staging table and uses a merge query to push all data from this table.\n\n**For PostgreSQL, MySQL, Azure Synapse, and Redshift** RudderStack uses `DELETE` to remove the duplicated events in the staging table before inserting them into the main table.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack does not support deduplication in the data lake destinations.\n\nQuestions?

Once it runs successfully, it returns the following geolocation data:\n\n*   City\n*   Country\n*   Region\n*   Location\n*   Postal code\n*   Timezone\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Note that:\n> \n> *   RudderStack supports both JavaScript and Python transformations for the geolocation enrichment feature.\n> *   If you’re hosting RudderStack on-premise, [contact the Customer Success team](mailto:%20support@rudderstack.com) to enable this feature.\n\n## License\n\nThis product includes GeoLite2 data created by MaxMind, available from [](https://www.maxmind.com/)[https://www.maxmind.com](https://www.maxmind.com/).\n\nFor more information, see [Maxmind license agreement](https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geolite2-free-geolocation-data#license).\n\n## Usage\n\nTo use the geolocation service, [add a new transformation](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/transformations/create/#adding-a-transformation) as shown:\n\n```\n/***\n * This transformation enriches events with geolocation data using an IP-to-geolocation API powered by Maxmind, available from https://www.maxmind.com.\n * This allows you to easily query events based on geolocation data, e.g., country, city.\n ***/\n\nexport async function transformEvent(event, metadata) {\n  if (event.request_ip) {\n    try {\n      if (!event.context) event.context = {};\n      event.context.geo = await geolocation(event.request_ip);\n    } catch (e) {\n      log(e.message);\n    }\n  }\n\n  return event;\n}\n```\n\n```\ndef transformEvent(event, metadata):\n    try:\n        if event.get('request_ip'):\n            res = geolocation(event[\"request_ip\"])\n            if not event.get('context', None):\n                event['context'] = {}\n            event['context']['geo'] = res\n    except Exception as e:\n        log(str(e))\n    return event\n```\n\nIn the above transformation, the geolocation service function (`geolocation`) takes the IP address present in the event (`request_ip`) as an argument. Once it runs successfully, it returns the following geolocation data:\n\n*   City\n*   Country\n*   Region\n*   Location\n*   Postal code\n*   Timezone\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> Note that:\n> \n> *   The geolocation data provided by RudderStack powered by Maxmind is not 100% accurate and varies by country. See the Maxmind website (link: [https://www.maxmind.com/en/geoip2-city-accuracy-comparison](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geoip2-city-accuracy-comparison)) to get the accuracy information by country.\n>     \n> *   RudderStack returns a `400 Bad Request` error if you pass a malformed IP address.\n>     \n> *   If you currently use a [geolocation enrichment template](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/transformations/templates/#geolocation-enrichment), switching to this transformation will result in some schema changes:\n>     \n>     *   RudderStack creates new columns for the IP addresses in your warehouse.\n>     *   It stores the country code instead of country name.\n\n[![Geolocation information](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/features/rudderstack-geolocation-service.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/features/rudderstack-geolocation-service.webp)\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### **How is this feature different from the geolocation enrichment transformation template?**\n\nRudderStack’s geolocation service feature lets you enrich events with users’ geolocation information for a given IP address by leveraging the **licensed** GeoLite2 data created by [MaxMind](https://www.maxmind.com/).\n\nOn the other hand, the [geolocation enrichment template](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/transformations/templates/#geolocation-enrichment) enriches events with geolocation data using an IP-to-geolocation API endpoint that **you need to provide**.\n\nQuestions?

Runs the transformation on the test events present in [`test-input-file`](#transformation-schema).\n2.  Generates and stores the output in a **test-outputs** folder contained within a zipped artifact.\n3.  Validates the output against the contents of the file specified in [`expected-output`](#transformation-schema).\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Note that:\n> \n> *   RudderStack stores the output from Step 1 in a `[transformation name in camel case]_output.json` file.\n> *   It stores the validation differences from Step 3 in the respective `[transformation name in camel case]_diff.json` file.\n> *   If you do not set `uploadTestArtifact` to `true` in the transformation action, RudderStack **does not** create the output zip containing the above files.\n> \n> For more context, see the use case below.\n\nConsider the following transformation schema:\n\n```\n// single transformationSchema\n{\n  \"file\": \"./code/t1.js\",\n  \"name\": \"action-T1\",\n  \"language\": \"javascript\",\n  \"description\": \"action-T1\",\n  \"test-input-file\": \"./code/testevents.json\",\n  \"expected-output\": \"./code/expectedoutput.json\"\n}\n```\n\nThe workflow when you set `uploadTestArtifact` to `true` is as follows:\n\n1.  RudderStack runs the transformation `action-T1`(with its code present in `t1.js`) on the `testevents.json` file.\n    \n2.  RudderStack then:\n    \n    1.  Generates and stores the output from Step 1 in a file named `actionT1_output.json`. This file is stored in a **test-outputs** folder contained within a zipped artifact.\n    2.  Validates the output with the contents present in the `expectedoutput.json` file. It stores any differences in a file named `actionT1_diff.json`.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> The **test-outputs** folder contains the two files - `actionT1_output.json` and `actionT1_diff.json`.\n\nQuestions?

    "markdown": "# Webhooks | RudderStack Docs\n\nSend your event data from RudderStack to your configured webhook endpoint.\n\n* * *\n\n*     7 minute read  \n    \n\nWebhooks let you send the events generated via RudderStack’s [SDKs](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/), [Cloud Apps](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/cloud-apps/), and [Reverse ETL](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/reverse-etl/) sources. It is useful in cases where you want to apply some custom logic on the event payload before sending it to your preferred destination platforms.\n\nOnce webhooks are enabled as a destination in your dashboard, RudderStack forwards the SDK events to your configured webhook endpoint.\n\n## Getting started\n\nBefore configuring your source and destination in the [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), verify if the platform you are working on is supported by the webhook destination by referring to the table below:\n\n| **Connection Mode** | **Web** | **Mobile** | **Server** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Device mode** | \\-  | \\-  | \\-  |\n| **Cloud mode** | **Supported** | **Supported** | **Supported** |\n\nOnce you have confirmed that your platform supports sending events to webhooks, perform the steps below:\n\n1.  Choose a source to which you would like to add your webhook endpoint as a destination.\n2.  Select the destination as **Webhook** to your source. Give your destination a name and then click **Continue**.\n\n### Connection settings\n\nIn the **Connection Settings** page, enter the relevant connection information and click **Next** to complete the destination setup.\n\n[![Webhook connection settings](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/webhook-connection-settings.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/webhook-connection-settings.webp)\n\n*   **Webhook URL**: This is the endpoint where RudderStack sends the events. Both `http` and `https` are supported. For `https`, **TLS cert** needs to be **valid** for a successful event delivery.\n*   **URL Method**: This is the HTTP method of the request sent to the configured endpoint. Supported methods are `POST`, `PUT` and `GET`. By default, RudderStack uses the `POST` method to send the events.\n*   **Headers**: Add custom headers for your events via this option. These headers will be added to the request made from RudderStack to your webhook. By default, RudderStack adds the following headers for the `POST` and `PUT` requests:\n\n| Key | Value |\n| --- | --- |\n| `User-Agent` | `RudderLabs` |\n| `Content-Type` | `application/json` |\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack also supports adding a dynamic header to your events through user transformation. For more information, refer to the [Sample RudderStack Transformations](https://github.com/rudderlabs/sample-user-transformers#dynamic-header) repository.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> You can also add a dynamic path to your base URL. For more information, refer to this [user transformation](https://github.com/rudderlabs/sample-user-transformers#dynamic-path).\n\n## Identify\n\nThe [`identify`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/identify/) call is used to associate a user to their actions. Apart from capturing a unique user ID, you can also send optional traits associated with that user, such as name, email, IP address, etc. using the RudderStack SDKs.\n\nA sample `identify` payload is as shown:\n\n```\n{\n  \"channel\": \"web\",\n  \"context\": {\n    \"app\": {\n      \"build\": \"1.0.0\",\n      \"name\": \"RudderLabs JavaScript SDK\",\n      \"namespace\": \"com.rudderlabs.javascript\",\n      \"version\": \"1.1.1-rc.2\"\n    },\n    \"traits\": {\n      \"name\": \"User name\",\n      \"email\": \"user@domain.com\",\n      \"plan\": \"Enterprise\",\n      \"company\": { \"id\": \"company-A\" },\n      \"createdAt\": \"Thu Mar 24 2016 17:46:45 GMT+0000 (UTC)\"\n    },\n    \"library\": { \"name\": \"RudderLabs JavaScript SDK\", \"version\": \"1.1.1-rc.2\" },\n    \"userAgent\": \"Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_14_6) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/80.0.3987.149 Safari/537.36\",\n    \"locale\": \"en-US\",\n    \"os\": { \"name\": \"\", \"version\": \"\" },\n    \"screen\": { \"density\": 1.600000023841858 },\n    \"page\": {\n      \"path\": \"/tests/html/script-test.html\",\n      \"referrer\": \"http://localhost:1111/tests/html/\",\n      \"search\": \"\",\n      \"title\": \"\",\n      \"url\": \"http://localhost:1111/tests/html/script-test.html\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"type\": \"identify\",\n  \"messageId\": \"508d5e8c-96e4-4301-bd46-1890dba5c866\",\n  \"originalTimestamp\": \"2020-04-22T08:06:20.337Z\",\n  \"anonymousId\": \"21b43de4-3b9b-423f-b51f-794eae31fc03\",\n  \"userId\": \"my-user-id\",\n  \"integrations\": { \"All\": true },\n  \"sentAt\": \"2020-04-22T08:06:20.337Z\"\n}\n```\n\nFor each `identify` call, RudderStack sends the request in the following manner (depending on the URL method configured in the dashboard):\n\n*   **`POST`**: RudderStack sends the whole event payload (as shown above) as the JSON body of the `POST` request.\n*   **`PUT`**: RudderStack sends the whole event payload (as shown above) as the JSON body of the `PUT` request.\n*   **`GET`**: RudderStack sends the traits passed in the `identify` call as the query parameters of the `GET` request. If your traits contain nested values, RudderStack flattens these values and sends them as the query parameters. For example, the company ID specified in the above payload’s `traits` is sent as `\"company.id\": \"company-A\"`.\n\n## Page\n\nThe [`page`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/page/) call lets you record your website’s page views, with any additional relevant information about the viewed page.\n\nA sample `page` payload is as shown:\n\n```\n{\n  \"channel\": \"web\",\n  \"context\": {\n    \"app\": {\n      \"build\": \"1.0.0\",\n      \"name\": \"RudderLabs JavaScript SDK\",\n      \"namespace\": \"com.rudderlabs.javascript\",\n      \"version\": \"1.1.1-rc.2\"\n    },\n    \"traits\": {},\n    \"library\": { \"name\": \"RudderLabs JavaScript SDK\", \"version\": \"1.1.1-rc.2\" },\n    \"userAgent\": \"Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_14_6) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/80.0.3987.149 Safari/537.36\",\n    \"locale\": \"en-US\",\n    \"os\": { \"name\": \"\", \"version\": \"\" },\n    \"screen\": { \"density\": 1.600000023841858 },\n    \"page\": {\n      \"path\": \"/tests/html/script-test.html\",\n      \"referrer\": \"http://localhost:1111/tests/html/\",\n      \"search\": \"\",\n      \"title\": \"\",\n      \"url\": \"http://localhost:1111/tests/html/script-test.html\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"type\": \"page\",\n  \"messageId\": \"97114191-e2f2-42af-97db-14b358b1cfe1\",\n  \"originalTimestamp\": \"2020-04-22T08:06:20.334Z\",\n  \"anonymousId\": \"57d95a96-61dc-47bf-8f96-5d37543d7438\",\n  \"userId\": \"user@domain.com\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"path\": \"/tests/html/script-test.html\",\n    \"referrer\": \"http://localhost:1111/tests/html/\",\n    \"search\": \"\",\n    \"title\": \"\",\n    \"url\": \"http://localhost:1111/tests/html/script-test.html\",\n    \"experiment\": {\"variant\": \"old\"}\n  },\n  \"integrations\": { \"All\": true },\n  \"sentAt\": \"2020-04-22T08:06:20.334Z\"\n}\n```\n\nFor each `page` call, RudderStack sends the request in the following manner(depending on the URL method configured in the dashboard):\n\n*   **`POST`:** RudderStack sends the whole event payload (as shown above) as the JSON body of the `POST` request.\n*   **`PUT`:** RudderStack sends the whole event payload (as shown above) as the JSON body of the `PUT` request.\n*   **`GET`:** RudderStack sends the properties passed in the `page` call as query parameters of the `GET` request. If your properties contain nested values, RudderStack flattens these values and sends them as query parameters. For example, the experiment variant specified in the above payload’s properties is sent as `\"experiment.variant\": \"old\"`.\n\n## Track\n\nThe [`track`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/track/) call captures all activities that the user performs, along with any other properties that are associated with those activities. Each of these activities or actions is considered as an **event**.\n\nA sample `track` payload is as shown:\n\n```\n{\n  \"channel\": \"web\",\n  \"context\": {\n    \"app\": {\n      \"build\": \"1.0.0\",\n      \"name\": \"RudderLabs JavaScript SDK\",\n      \"namespace\": \"com.rudderlabs.javascript\",\n      \"version\": \"1.1.1-rc.2\"\n    },\n    \"traits\": {\n      \"name\": \"User name\",\n      \"email\": \"user@doamin.com\",\n      \"plan\": \"Enterprise\",\n      \"company\": { \"id\": \"comapny-A\" },\n      \"createdAt\": \"Thu Mar 24 2016 17:46:45 GMT+0000 (UTC)\"\n    },\n    \"library\": { \"name\": \"RudderLabs JavaScript SDK\", \"version\": \"1.1.1-rc.2\" },\n    \"userAgent\": \"Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_14_6) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/80.0.3987.149 Safari/537.36\",\n    \"locale\": \"en-US\",\n    \"os\": { \"name\": \"\", \"version\": \"\" },\n    \"screen\": { \"density\": 1.600000023841858 },\n    \"page\": {\n      \"path\": \"/tests/html/script-test.html\",\n      \"referrer\": \"http://localhost:1111/tests/html/\",\n      \"search\": \"\",\n      \"title\": \"\",\n      \"url\": \"http://localhost:1111/tests/html/script-test.html\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"type\": \"track\",\n  \"messageId\": \"04a303b1-a466-4e66-9022-2a24edaca4fc\",\n  \"originalTimestamp\": \"2020-04-22T08:06:20.338Z\",\n  \"anonymousId\": \"21b43de4-3b9b-423f-b51f-794eae31fc03\",\n  \"userId\": \"my-user-id\",\n  \"event\": \"Product Purchased\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"order_ID\": \"1\",\n    \"category\": \"boots\",\n    \"product_name\": \"new_boots\",\n    \"price\": 60,\n    \"currency\": \"USD\"\n  },\n  \"integrations\": { \"All\": true },\n  \"sentAt\": \"2020-04-22T08:06:20.338Z\"\n}\n```\n\nTo view the other events and detailed event structure for the types of events being sent, refer to the [RudderStack Event Spec](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/) guide.\n\nFor each `track` call, RudderStack sends the request in the following manner(depending on the URL method configured in the dashboard):\n\n*   **`POST`:** RudderStack sends the whole event payload (as shown above) as the JSON body of the `POST` request.\n*   **`PUT`:** RudderStack sends the whole event payload (as shown above) as the JSON body of the `PUT` request.\n*   **`GET`:** RudderStack sends the properties that you pass in the `track` call as query parameters of the `GET` request. If your properties contain nested values, RudderStack will flatten these values before sending them.\n\nIn the settings config, you can set static headers for the webhook call. However, in some cases you may want to dynamically change or add a header to the webhook. This can be done through a top-level object with a key of `header`. This top-level key can be added using a [user transformation](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/transformations/overview/) and the following line of code `event.header = { \"Authorization\": \"some-auth\" }`. Below is an example of a payload with this feature.\n\n```\n{\n  event: \"some-event-name\",\n  type: \"track\",\n  properties: {\n    color: \"blue\",\n    number: 3,\n    newMember: true\n  },\n  header: {\n    \"Authorization\": \"Bearer 3841718412jhcdskc\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Dynamically appending to the endpoint URL\n\nIn the settings config, you will enter the endpoint that this webhook will be pointed to. There are some use-cases where depending on the event that is going to this destination, the endpoint may need to be changed. RudderStack allows you to append a dynamic string to your webhook endpoint using a top-level key named `appendPath`. This top-level key can be added using a [user transformation](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/transformations/overview/) and the following line of code `event.appendPath = 'some-path'`.\n\n```\nFixed Endpoint URL From Settings\n--------------------------------\nendpoint: 'https://www.google.com/'\n\nDynamically Append String to Endpoint\n-------------------------------------\nappendPath: 'search?q=cats'\n\nFinal Endpoint\n--------------\nendpoint: 'https://www.google.com/search?q=cats'\n```\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### How do I check if there are any event delivery failures?\n\n1.  Log into your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/).\n2.  Verify that you are sending the events in the **Live Events** tab of your source.\n3.  Check if there are any delivery failures in the **Live Events** tab of your destination. An example of an event failure is as shown:\n\n[![Webhook endpoint](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-sources/webhook-endpoint-url.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-sources/webhook-endpoint-url.webp)\n\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59817155/125619804-64033117-16f6-44c7-8050-286059ab404d.png)\n\n4.  You can then check the **Error Response** to get more details about the error, including the reason of the failure:\n\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59817155/125619922-c68b1c48-50aa-4ce9-8803-8381170e3cc9.png)\n\nQuestions?

    "markdown": "# Transformations FAQ | RudderStack Docs\n\nAnswers to some of the commonly asked questions related to RudderStack’s Transformations feature.\n\n* * *\n\n*     5 minute read  \n    \n\n## Transformations\n\n#### Are there any sample user transformations I can refer to?\n\nSee the [Transformation Templates](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/transformations/templates/) guide for a list of prebuilt JavaScript functions that you can use to create transformations and implement use cases on your event data.\n\nYou can also check the [Sample RudderStack Transformations](https://github.com/rudderlabs/sample-user-transformers) GitHub repository.\n\n#### Is the transformation connected to a source or destination?\n\nA transformation is always connected to a destination. RudderStack gives you the option to add a transformation while setting up a destination:\n\n[![Connecting a transformation](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/features/connecting-a-transformation.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/features/connecting-a-transformation.webp)\n\n#### Can I connect multiple transformations to a destination?\n\nNo, it is not possible to connect multiple transformations to a destination. Instead, you can implement multiple use-cases in the same transformation, for example, event filtering followed by cleaning.\n\n#### Can I write a transformation that can be applied to a small batch of events?\n\nYes, you can use the `transformBatch` function to apply a transformation to a batch of events.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n\n#### What is the supported Python version for Python transformations?\n\nRudderStack uses Python 3.11 for Python transformations (available only in the RudderStack Cloud [Growth](https://rudderstack.com/pricing/) and [Enterprise](https://www.rudderstack.com/enterprise-quote/) plans).\n\n#### What is a referenced transformation?\n\nIf a library `L` is [imported by the transformations](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/transformations/libraries/) `T1`, `T2`, and `T3`, then `T1`, `T2`, and `T3`are called the referenced transformations to `L`.\n\n#### I used to write transformations like `function transform(events) {}`. Why am I not able to create new transformations this way?\n\nBy default, RudderStack supports writing functions that transform a single event instead of a batch of events. You can now define your transformation in the following manner:\n\n```\nexport function transformEvent(event, metadata) {\n    return event;\n}\n```\n\n```\ndef transformEvent(event, metadata):\n    return event\n```\n\n#### Can I update my existing version v0 transformation code to the the latest version?\n\nYou cannot update an existing `Version: V0` transformation to the current version.\n\nInstead, you can [create a new transformation](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/transformations/create/#adding-a-transformation) based on the [`transformEvent` function](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/transformations/usage/#apply-transformation-on-single-event), then reconnect your destinations with this transformation. Finally, delete the existing `Version: V0` transformation.\n\n#### What are transformation and library revisions?\n\nUsing the [Event filtering](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/event-filtering/), you can create and store a transformation or library as a draft without publishing them. These are called revisions.\n\nOnce the revisions meet the test criteria, you can restore and publish them for production use.\n\n## Device mode transformations\n\n#### While sending events in device mode, how should I choose between event filtering and transformations?\n\nYou can choose any based on your requirements:\n\n*   **[Event filtering](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/event-filtering/)**: When you just want to filter out the events based on the event names. The event filtering takes place within the SDK and is **only applicable** for the `track` events.\n*   **Transformations**: Transformations is a generic feature which can be used to manipulate the events, mask data, enrich events, implement specific actions on events. It involves a call to an external RudderStack service.\n\nIn case you plan to use both the above-mentioned features, your events will be filtered (based on the [event filtering](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/event-filtering/) settings in the RudderStack dashboard) and transformed (based on the applied transformation) before being sent to the destination.\n\n#### Is there any added performance cost to using the transformations in device mode?\n\nYes, RudderStack makes a network call for each event (in case of JavaScript SDK) or a batch of events (in case of mobile SDKs) when the transformations are used in device mode.\n\n#### Can I switch back to the previous version of an SDK while using a transformation in device mode?\n\n*   **For Mobile SDKs**: Yes, you can switch back to the previous SDK version. However, the transformation might not be supported in the previous version.\n*   **For JavaScript SDK**: It depends on the SDK installation method:\n    *   If installed through RudderStack CDN, it’s not possible to downgrade the SDK version.\n    *   If installed through NPM, it’s possible to downgrade the SDK version. However, the transformation might not be supported in the previous version.\n\n#### Will my event be lost in case of a network error while using a transformation in device mode?\n\n**No events are lost in case of mobile SDK’s** as they are saved locally in the database before being sent to the destination. Once sent successfully, they’re removed from the database.\n\nHowever, there is a chance of events getting lost while sending them via JavaScript SDK in case of a network error as they are not persisted. However, the SDK retries multiple times before dropping the event.\n\n## Libraries\n\n#### How does RudderStack test any library updates?\n\nIf you update a library that is referenced in any transformation, RudderStack tests the new library code along with the transformation code against the default event payload. This ensures that the transformation does not break due to any changes in the library.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack currently does not support testing libraries with custom events.\n\n#### Can I test my library with sample events?\n\nRudderStack currently does not support testing libraries with custom events. It provides a default payload against which you can test the library code along with any referenced transformations.\n\n#### Why am I not able to update my library?\n\nIf you update a library, [RudderStack tests the new library code](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/transformations/faq/#how-does-rudderstack-test-any-library-updates) along with the referenced transformation code. This ensures that the transformation does not break due to any changes in the library.\n\nIf you’re unable to update the library, it is likely that that the transformation is breaking because of the changes. Add the referenced transformation code and test the changes thoroughly.\n\n#### What is a referenced library?\n\nIf a transformation `T` [imports a library](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/transformations/libraries/) `L` in its code, then `L` is called as a referenced library to `T`.\n\n#### I cannot import libraries into my existing transformations. What should I do?\n\nIf you cannot import libraries into your existing transformations, there is a strong likelihood that your existing transformations are based on the older version (`Version: V0`). To confirm if your transformation is based on an older version, check if your transformation has **Version: V0**:\n\n[![v0 transformations](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/features/older-transformation.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/features/older-transformation.webp)\n\nTo import the libraries in a transformation, follow these steps:\n\n1.  Create a new transformation by following the steps in the [Adding a transformation](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/transformations/create/#adding-a-transformation) section.\n2.  Add the updated transformation code as specified in the [`transformEvent` function](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/transformations/usage/#apply-transformation-on-single-event) section.\n3.  Connect the transformation to your destination. For more information, see [Connecting a transformation to the destination](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/transformations/manage/#connect-transformation-to-destination) section.\n4.  You can then import libraries in the transformation. For more information, see [Using libraries in transformations](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/transformations/libraries/).\n\nQuestions?

RudderStack’s **Profiles** unifies every user touchpoint and trait into comprehensive customer profiles, establishing the data warehouse as the core of the customer data platform.\n\nWith Profiles, data teams can efficiently resolve identities and create user features to produce a comprehensive customer 360 table.\n\nThe following self-guided tour shows how to use Profiles:\n\n## Highlights\n\nSee the following guides to learn more about Profiles features and their usage:\n\n| Guide | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Quickstart](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/profiles/get-started/) | Create your first Profiles project using the [RudderStack dashboard](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/profiles/get-started/quickstart-ui/) or [Profile Builder (PB) CLI tool](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/profiles/get-started/profile-builder/). |\n| [Identity stitching](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/profiles/core-concepts/identity-stitching/) | Stitch different identifiers across multiple channels to create a comprehensive user profile. |\n| [Feature development](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/profiles/core-concepts/feature-development/) | Enhance the unified profiles with additional data points and features. |\n| [Warehouse permissions](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/profiles/permissions/) | Grant RudderStack the required permissions on your data warehouse. |\n| [Project structure](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/profiles/cli-user-guide/structure/) | Know the detailed project structure of a Profiles project. |\n| [Commands](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/profiles/cli-user-guide/commands/) | List of commands you can use for the Profiles CLI project. |\n| [Cohorts](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/profiles/cohorts/) | Build core customer segments and use them for targeted campaigns. |\n| [Activations](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/profiles/activations/) | Activate your cohorts data in the downstream destinations. |\n| [Predictions](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/profiles/predictions/) | Create predictive features using the data present in your warehouse. |\n| [Examples](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/profiles/example/) | Create sample Profiles projects using different model types. |\n| [Glossary](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/profiles/resources/glossary/) | Commonly used Profiles terminology. |\n\n## Why use Profiles?\n\nData teams often face challenges when building a comprehensive customer view. Maintaining large, complex SQL models or working around the limitations of rigid SaaS platforms is time-consuming and expensive at scale.\n\nProfiles simplifies this process of unifying customer data by automating the manual data engineering and modeling required to build an identity graph, layer new data sources into customer profiles, and compute user features that leverage data from diverse sources.\n\nUsing Profiles, data teams can quickly build and easily maintain a comprehensive customer 360 table and make it available to downstream teams and tools.\n\n#### Move faster with an end-to-end platform\n\nProfiles integrates directly with RudderStack’s other pipelines:\n\n*   [Event Stream](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/) and [Cloud Extract](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/extract/) (ETL) pipelines have known schemas and unique identifiers through the ingested customer data. Profiles can produce a baseline identity graph, and user features out of the box. Data teams can then augment the graph and features using any other data in their warehouse.\n*   [Reverse ETL](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/reverse-etl/) pipeline makes it easy to send data from the customer 360 table directly to the downstream tools used by marketing, customer success, product, and other teams.\n\n#### Enrich user profiles with features\n\nYou can [enhance user profiles](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/profiles/core-concepts/feature-development/) with additional data points and features. When new data sources are added, discovered, or calculated, data teams can add them to their Profiles configuration without having to clean data and update complex models and dependencies.\n\nThe features/traits can include demographic information, preferences, purchase history, browsing behavior, or other static or computed data points.\n\n#### Unlock deeper insights\n\nProfiles extends its capabilities to support features derived from complex concepts such as funnels, organizational metrics, and machine learning models. You can understand your customer’s journey through your sales funnel or locate each user across the histogram of customer metric values by simply defining a trait.\n\n#### Deliver personalization and recommendations\n\nUsing Profiles, you can ship projects like personalization significantly faster by focusing entirely on activating key user features instead of cleaning and modeling data to build them.\n\n#### Predict user conversions and churn\n\nYou can leverage [Predictions](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/profiles/predictions/) to build predictive features that help you predict in advance whether a lead is likely to convert, or a customer is likely to churn or make a purchase.\n\n## Who can leverage Profiles?\n\nProfiles is built for data engineers, data scientists, and technical marketers. You can define identity stitching, and user features as configuration files without requiring deep SQL, Python, or technical knowledge.\n\nYou can define the associated properties or attributes that provide detailed information for each new feature. For example, if the feature is `purchase_history`, its properties can include the date of purchase, product category, or order value.\n\nQuestions?

    "markdown": "# How Profiles Works | RudderStack Docs\n\nKnow how Profiles collect, unify, and activate your data to enhance the overall customer experience.\n\n* * *\n\n*     3 minute read  \n    \n\nRudderStack helps you build a complete CDP on top of your data warehouse in three stages - **Collect**, **Unify**, and **Activate**.\n\nThe following sections highlight RudderStack’s comprehensive solution at every stage to create a complete customer profile.\n\n[![Profiles Overview](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/profiles/profiles-overview.png)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/profiles/profiles-overview.png)\n\n### Collect\n\nFirst, RudderStack collects and stores all the source data in your warehouse. This includes:\n\n*   Event data, for example, user interaction data from web and mobile apps.\n*   Data from cloud sources, for example, CRM platforms like Salesforce, support tools like Zendesk, etc.\n\n#### Known data\n\nRudderStack collects all the information from:\n\n1.  First-party data: Data collected from the enterprise’s own mobile application, websites, POS systems, etc.\n2.  Third-party apps like SalesForce CRM, Zendesk Support, ecommerce payments via Stripe, etc.\n\nThere is a known ID for all of these by which RudderStack collects the data like email, user ID, etc.\n\n#### Unknown Data\n\nThis includes unknown user attributes like `anonymousId` captured from the RudderStack SDKs on the web/mobile apps. It is helpful in tracking user activities in cases where they are not logged in.\n\nThe difference between known and unknown data is that in the former, we have information about the user. First-party data can be known data if a user is logged in. For example, the data from cloud sources will always be known. However, data from the event stream sources can be known or unknown depending on whether a user had logged in.\n\nAs the data is collected, you can apply relevant transformations to it for compliance/security purposes like data governance, privacy, etc.\n\nThe below image highlights a snapshot of the `identifies` and `tracks` [tables](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/warehouse-destinations/warehouse-schema/#schema), that RudderStack leverages for unifying the data.\n\n[![Identifies and Tracks tables for stitching](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/profiles/identifies-tracks-stitch.png)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/profiles/identifies-tracks-stitch.png)\n\n### Unify\n\nAt this stage, Profiles takes over and does the following:\n\n#### ID Stitching\n\nProfiles stitches together all the known and unknown IDs into a single table. The IDs are linked using an autogenerated ID known as `rudderId`, which is akin to a golden record. Imagine a 1-to-many relationship, in which one `rudderId` has multiple values for other IDs like user ID, anonymous ID, email, etc.\n\nWith a `rudderId`, you can easily identify that a customer - who shopped on your website 6 months ago, anonymously browsed from mobile 4 months ago, raised a complaint with the support team 2 months ago - is actually the same customer. RudderStack represents them as different nodes/edges of the ID stitching graph.\n\n[![Identity stitching](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/profiles/identity-stitching.png)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/profiles/identity-stitching.png)\n\n#### Feature Views\n\nIf the entity features/traits are spread across multiple entity vars and ML models, you can use Feature views to get them together into a single view. These models are usually defined in the `pb_project.yaml` file by creating entries under `feature_views` key with corresponding entity.\n\n[![Features generation](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/profiles/features-generation.png)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/profiles/features-generation.png)\n\n#### Feature Table\n\nThe entity vars specified in the project are unified into a view. A **Feature Table** is a unified customer profile containing useful information for each customer. Once all the known and unknown identities are stitched together, you can trace back activities for all such identifiers and aggregate them under the common `rudderId`. This is helpful in calculating features across all such interactions.\n\nSome common use cases are computing the customer’s total LTV (lifetime value), purchase history, number of days a customer was active, etc.\n\n### Activate\n\nActivation is a two-step process. In the first step, the user creates the target audience using RudderStack’s [Audiences](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/data-pipelines/reverse-etl/features/audiences/) feature. They would then use Reverse ETL to route this audience information (also persisted in the same cloud warehouse) to downstream marketing tools like Braze, Mailchimp, etc.\n\n[![Audience Builder / Cohorts](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/profiles/audience-builder-cohorts.png)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/profiles/audience-builder-cohorts.png)\n\nAdditionally - you can use the feature tables as inputs to ML models for use cases like churn prediction, lifetime value (LTV) prediction, etc. Again, you can route the output of such models to marketing platforms via Reverse ETL.\n\nAs you keep collecting data, Profiles continues to unify and send it for activation.\n\n[![Profiles lifecycle](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/profiles/profiles-life-cycle.png)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/profiles/profiles-life-cycle.png)\n\nIn this way, you can make informed decisions, run personalized marketing campaigns, and enhance the overall customer experience across multiple platforms.\n\nQuestions?

    "markdown": "# Set Up Facebook Custom Audience\n\nSend your event data from RudderStack to Facebook Custom Audience.\n\n* * *\n\n*     8 minute read  \n    \n\nRudderStack lets you send your customer events for creating custom audiences by leveraging the Facebook Marketing API.\n\nFind the open source transformer code for this destination in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-transformer/tree/master/src/v0/destinations/fb_custom_audience).\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> The user information in your events may include email, phone number, gender, etc. For more information on the supported fields, refer to the [Facebook documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/audiences/guides/custom-audiences#hash).\n\n## Getting started\n\nRudderStack supports sending event data to Facebook Custom Audience via the following [connection modes](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/):\n\n| **Connection Mode** | **Web** | **Mobile** | **Server** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Device mode** | \\-  | \\-  | \\-  |\n| **Cloud mode** | \\-  | \\-  | **Supported** |\n\nOnce you have confirmed that the source platform supports sending events to Facebook Custom Audience, follow these steps:\n\n1.  From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add the source. Then, from the list of destinations, select **Facebook Custom Audience**.\n2.  Assign a name to your destination and click **Continue**.\n\n### Connection settings\n\nTo add Custom Audience as a destination in RudderStack, you will need to configure the following settings:\n\n*   **Access Token**: Enter the access token of your business application set up for accessing the Facebook Marketing API. For more information on obtaining this token, refer to the [FAQ](#where-can-i-find-the-user-access-token-for-the-application) section.\n*   **App Secret**: Enter your [app secret](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/security/#appsecret) from the basic app settings page of your [Facebook Developer account](https://developers.facebook.com/).\n*   **Audience Batch Size**: Specify the data size you want RudderStack to send to Facebook in a single event. For example, if you want to send a total 1000 user records to Facebook and set the batch size to 50, then RudderStack will send 20 events to Facebook with 50 user records in each event.\n*   **Schema Fields** Choose your schema fields (at least one) from the available options. **This is a mandatory field**. RudderStack expects the user events to consist of **every** schema field that has been chosen in the dashboard.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack ignores any user information which does not adhere to the schema fields specified in the dashboard settings.\n\n*   **Enable Hashing**: Enabled by default, this option lets RudderStack hash encode the user data irrespective of the schema type chosen in the RudderStack dashboard. Facebook expects the user data to be hash encoded using `SHA256`.\n*   **Is The Data Raw**: As RudderStack does not support combinational schema fields, this field is ignored if not enabled.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> It is highly recommended not to exceed the batch size of 100.\n\n*   **Disable Formatting**: Enable this option to **not** format the user data before sending it to Custom Audience. Facebook has fixed data formats for all the allowed schema fields. Refer to the [Explicit formatting feature](##explicit-formatting-feature) section for more information.\n*   **Type**: Specify the type of the custom audience.\n*   **Sub Type**: Specify the sub-type of the custom audience.\n*   **OneTrust consent categories**: Specify the category IDs to associate the [OneTrust](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/data-governance/consent-management/onetrust/javascript/) cookie consent groups to Facebook. |\n\n#### Cloud SDK settings\n\n*   **Audience ID**: Enter the [custom audience ID](#where-can-i-find-the-custom-audience-id) to which the audiences should be added/removed.\n\n## `audiencelist` event structure\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> Facebook Custom Audience destination supports only `audiencelist` calls.\n\nThe `audiencelist` event expects the `add` and `remove` arrays containing the user data objects. These arrays are wrapped inside the `listData` object. The custom audience must have edit permissions to let RudderStack add or remove users from it.\n\n*   **add**: User information that needs to be added to Custom Audience.\n*   **remove**: User information that needs to be deleted from Custom Audience.\n\n## Schema fields mapping\n\nThe following table details the mapping of the schema fields specified in the [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/) and the Facebook Marketing API.\n\n| **Dashboard Field Name** | **Marketing API Schema Field (RudderStack Supported Field Name)** | **Field Guidelines** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `EMAIL` | `EMAIL` | Trim any leading or trailing whitespaces and convert all the characters to lower case. |\n| `PHONE` | `PHONE` | Remove symbols, letters, and any leading zeroes. The country code is needed as a prefix, if the `COUNTRY` field is not specified in the dashboard. |\n| `GENDER` | `GEN` | Use these values: `m` or `male` for male and `f` or `female` for female. |\n| `MADID` | `MADID` | Use lowercase and keep the hyphens. This information will not be hashed. |\n| `EXTERN_ID` | `EXTERN_ID` | This information will not be hashed. |\n| `DOB YEAR (YYYY)` | `DOBY` | Use the YYYY format from `1900` to the current year. |\n| `DOB MONTH (MM)` | `DOBM` | Use the MM format from `01` to `12`. |\n| `DOB DATE (DD)` | `DOBD` | Use the DD format from `01` to `31`. |\n| `LAST NAME` | `LN` | Use a-z only. Lower case only, no punctuation. Use special characters in the UTF-8 format. |\n| `FIRST NAME` | `FN` | Use a-z only. Lower case only, no punctuation. Use special characters in the UTF-8 format. |\n| `FIRST NAME INITIAL` | `FI` | Use a-z only. Lower case only. Use special characters in the UTF-8 format. |\n| `CITY` | `CT` | Use a-z only. Lower case only, with no punctuation, no special characters, and no whitespace. |\n| `US STATES` | `ST` | Use the 2-character ANSI abbreviation code in lower case. Normalize the states outside the US in lowercase, with no punctuation, no special characters, and no white space. |\n| `ZIP` | `ZIP` | Use lower case and no white space. For the US, use only the first 5 digits. For the UK, use the Area/District/Sector format. |\n| `COUNTRY` | `COUNTRY` | Use lower case, 2-letter ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country codes. |\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack modifies the schema names visible in the dashboard to ensure better readability. However, during the event call, the field names **must be exactly the same as** the schema names specified by Facebook Marketing API, as mentioned in the table above.\n\n## Explicit formatting feature\n\nIf the **Disable Formatting** option is enabled in the RudderStack dashboard, RudderStack will not format the user data in the format prescribed by the Facebook Marketing API. If it is disabled, RudderStack formats the schema fields input by the user as shown in the table below:\n\n| **Schema Field Name** | **Example Input** | **Formatted Output (Before Hashing)** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `EMAIL` | `ABC@gmail.com` | `abc@gmail.com` |\n| `PHONE` | `0@96346895` | `96346895` |\n| `GEN` | `FEMALE` | `f` |\n| `DOBD` | `2` | `02` |\n| `DOBM` | `1` | `01` |\n| `LN & FN` | `Abc,@` | `abc@` |\n| `FI` | `Mr.` | `mr.` |\n| `CT` | `HN#` | `hn` |\n| `ST` | `? AL ?` | `al` |\n| `ZIP` | `11502 @bc` | `11502@bc` |\n| `COUNTRY` | `IN` | `in` |\n\nThe following code snippet shows an `audiencelist` event with the schema fields (`EMAIL` and `FIRST NAME`) specified in the RudderStack dashboard:\n\n```\n{\n  \"type\": \"audiencelist\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"listData\": {\n      \"add\": [{\n          \"EMAIL\": \"name1@abc.com\",\n          \"FN\": \"name1\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"EMAIL\": \"name2@abc.com\",\n          \"FN\": \"name2\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"EMAIL\": \"name3@abc.com\",\n          \"FN\": \"name3\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"remove\": [{\n          \"EMAIL\": \"name4@abc.com\",\n          \"FN\": \"name4\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"EMAIL\": \"name5@abc.com\",\n          \"FN\": \"name5\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Facebook Custom Audience payload restrictions\n\n| **Payload Field** | **Transformed?** |\n| --- | --- |\n| Using only `add` | Yes |\n| Using only `remove` | Yes |\n| Using both `add` and `remove` | Yes |\n| Not using both `add` and `remove` | No  |\n\nThe following code snippet shows an `audiencelist` event containing the `add` array with the schema fields (`EMAIL` and `FIRST NAME`) specified in the RudderStack dashboard:\n\n```\n{\n  \"type\": \"audiencelist\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"listData\": {\n      \"add\": [{\n          \"EMAIL\": 'name1@abc.com',\n          \"FN\": 'name1'\n        },\n        {\n          \"EMAIL\": 'name2@abc.com',\n          \"FN\": 'name2'\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nSimilarly, you can use `remove` array in order to remove users from a particular custom audience without creating a session.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> The event payload must include either `add` or `remove` . Otherwise, the user data won’t be transformed and sent to Custom Audience.\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### What are the prerequisites for creating an audience list?\n\nBefore creating a new audience list, make sure that:\n\n*   You are an [admin system user](https://en-gb.facebook.com/business/help/327596604689624?id=2190812977867143).

    "markdown": "# Set Up Google Adwords Remarketing Lists (Customer Match)\n\nSend your event data from RudderStack to Google Adwords Remarketing Lists.\n\n* * *\n\n*     7 minute read  \n    \n\nBefore configuring Google Adwords Remarketing Lists as a destination in RudderStack, verify if the source platform is supported by referring to the table below:\n\n| **Connection Mode** | **Web** | **Mobile** | **Server** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Device mode** | \\-  | \\-  | \\-  |\n| **Cloud mode** | \\-  | \\-  | **Supported** |\n\nOnce you have confirmed that the source platform supports sending events to Google Adwords Remarketing Lists, follow these steps:\n\n1.  From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add the source. Then, from the list of destinations, select **Google Adwords Remarketing Lists (Customer Match)**.\n2.  Assign a name to your destination and click **Next**.\n\n## Connection settings\n\nTo successfully configure Google Adwords Remarketing Lists as a destination, first authenticate your account by following the below steps:\n\n1.  Click **Create Account** in the **Account Settings** section.\n2.  From the modal, click the **Sign in with Google** button.\n3.  Choose the required account and grant RudderStack the required permissions.\n4.  Click **Save** to use the specified account:\n\n[![Google Account authentication](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/account-connect-normal.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/account-connect-normal.webp)\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> If you have authenticated multiple accounts, click **Edit Credentials** to select or delete any other authenticated account:\n> \n> ![Google Account authentication](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/edit-account-creds.webp)\n> \n> RudderStack **gives an error** if you try to delete an account used by any other connection set up for the same destination.\n\nNext, configure the following settings:\n\n*   **Customer ID**: Enter the ID associated with your Google Ads account. You can find it by clicking on the **Help** option in your dashboard. For more information on obtaining the customer ID, refer to the [Google Ads Help Center](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/1704344?hl=en) page.\n    \n*   **Subaccount**: Enable this setting if you are using a Google Ads subaccount. For more information on subaccounts, refer to the [Google Ads Help Center](https://support.google.com/campaignmanager/answer/2829448?hl=en#zippy=%2Cwhat-are-subaccounts) page.\n    \n    *   **Login-customer-ID**: If **Subaccount** is toggled on, enter the customer ID of the parent account associated with the subaccount. This field is required only when you want to send data to a customer list of a subaccount.\n*   **List type**: Select the type of list you want to create. You can create three types of list via this setting:\n    \n    *   **General**: You can send email, phone number, and address information in this list. RudderStack will hash this data and send it to Google Adwords Remarketing Lists depending on the **Hash Required** setting (enabled by default).\n    *   **UserId**: You can send third party user IDs in this list.\n    *   **Mobile Device ID**: You can send mobile device IDs in this list.\n*   **Specify consent for uploaded users for using their data in Google Advertising Purpose**: Select the required consent setting from the dropdown.\n    \n*   **Specify consent for uploaded users regarding Ads Personalization**: Select the required consent setting from the dropdown.\n    \n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack provides four options for the above consent settings - **Unspecified**, **Unknown**, **Granted**, and **Denied**.\n> \n> Also, note that:\n> \n> *   If you do not set these fields, RudderStack sets their value to **Unspecified** by default.\n> *   If you set these fields to any other values except the above-mentioned ones, RudderStack automatically sets their value to **Unknown**.\n\n*   **Hash Required**: This setting is enabled by default and hashes the `email`, `phone`, `firstName`, and `lastName` fields in the SHA-256 format.\n*   **Schema Fields**: If you have selected **General** as the list type, you will need to choose your schema fields (at least one) from the available options. The options are `hashedEmail`, `hashedPhoneNumber`, and `addressInfo`.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack expects the user events to consist of all schema fields listed here.\n\n*   **List ID**: To get your Google Ads list ID, go to your Google Ads account and navigate to **Tools & settings** > **Audience Manager**.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> This setting is only visible when connecting the destination to a non-Reverse ETL source. You can specify whether to [create or use an existing audience](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/reverse-etl-destinations/google-adwords-remarketing-list/connect-retl-source/#set-up-the-connection) while setting up the connection with a Reverse ETL source.\n\n## Google Ads permissions\n\nThis integration relies on the authorizing Google Ads user’s [underlying permissions](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/9978556) and must be at least **Standard** or **Admin**.\n\nIf you authorize the integration without the **Standard** or **Admin** permissions, the API calls will fail and a “RudderStack Admin” user will disable the integration. If you encounter an entry in your [audit logs](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/dashboard-guides/audit-logs/) from a `Rudder Admin/admin@rudderstack.com` user, it means that RudderStack disabled the integration on account of insufficient user permissions.\n\nTo avoid this, ensure that the authorizing user has the **Standard** permissions, at minimum.\n\n## `audiencelist` event structure\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Note that:\n> \n> *   The Google Adwords Remarketing Lists destination supports only `audiencelist` calls. You can send up to 100000 user records in one call.\n> *   RudderStack supports both additions and deletions to a user list.\n\nThe following code snippet shows a sample `audienceList` call:\n\n```\n{\n  \"userId\": \"user1\",\n  \"anonymousId\": \"anon-id-new\",\n  \"event\": \"event1\",\n  \"type\": \"audiencelist\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"listData\": {\n      \"add\": [{\n          \"email\": \"alex@example.com\",\n          \"phone\": \"1234567890\",\n          \"firstName\": \"Alex\",\n          \"lastName\": \"Keener\",\n          \"country\": \"USA\",\n          \"postalCode\": \"90001\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"email\": \"emily@example.com\",\n          \"phone\": \"8015550101\",\n          \"firstName\": \"Emily\",\n          \"lastName\": \"Wallace\",\n          \"country\": \"USA\",\n          \"postalCode\": \"90009\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"remove\": [{\n        \"email\": \"john@example.com\",\n        \"phone\": \"8015550102\",\n        \"firstName\": \"John\",\n        \"lastName\": \"Doe\",\n        \"country\": \"USA\",\n        \"postalCode\": \"90002\"\n      }]\n    },\n    \"enablePartialFailure\": true\n  },\n  \"context\": {\n    \"ip\": \"14.5.67.21\",\n    \"library\": {\n      \"name\": \"http\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"timestamp\": \"2020-02-02T00:23:09.544Z\"\n}\n```\n\n### Supported schema mapping\n\nThe following table details the mapping of the schema fields specified in the RudderStack dashboard and Google Adwords Remarketing Lists, along with the relevant guidelines:\n\n| RudderStack schema field | Google Adwords Remarketing Lists field | Guidelines |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `email` | `hashedEmail` | Include a domain name for all email addresses. Remove any spaces in between the addresses. |\n| `phone` | `hashedPhone` | Format the phone number using the [E.164 format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.164). Include the country code as well. |\n| `firstName` | `hashedFirstName` | Do not include any prefixes (e.g., `Mrs.`). |\n| `lastName` | `hashedLastName` | Do not include any suffixes (e.g., `Sr.`). |\n| `country` | `countryCode` | Use the ISO two-letter/three-letter [country codes](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/reference/data/codes-formats#expandable-16). Include the country code even if all your users belong to the same country. |\n| `postalCode` | `postalCode` | Both the US and international zip and postal codes are allowed. For the US, 5 digit codes followed by 4 digit extensions are also allowed. For the rest of the countries, do not include the postal code extensions. |\n| `mobileId` | `mobileId` | Only include the mobile device ID. No other data types are accepted. |\n| `thirdPartyUserId` | `thirdPartyUserID` | Do not include any numbers. Only a string is accepted. |\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### Where can I find my Google Adwords customer ID?\n\nTo get the customer ID associated with your Google Ads account, click the **Help** option in your Google Ads dashboard. You will find the customer ID in the resulting pop-up:\n\n[![Google Adwords Remarketing Lists (Customer Match) connection settings](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/google-adwords-remarketing-lists-customer-id.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/google-adwords-remarketing-lists-customer-id.webp)\n\n#### Can I set up the Enhanced Conversions and Remarketing Lists destinations using the same Google Ads account?\n\nYes, you can. Both the integrations are the sub-features of Google Ads. Hence, you can use the same Google Ads account to configure both the destinations in RudderStack.\n\n#### How do I create a Google Ads customer list?\n\nTo create a customer list in Google Ads, follow these steps:\n\n1.  Open your Google Ads account.\n2.  Go to **Tools and settings**.\n3.  Under **Shared Library**, go to **Audience Manager**.\n4.  Click the + button and select **Customer list**.\n    *   In **Segment name**, assign a name to the list.\n    *   From the dropdown, select the list type of data to upload.\n    *   Upload the CSV containing the user data. You can also download the template and upload the data.\n    *   Finally, click **UPLOAD AND CREATE**.\n\n#### What are the account permissions required for this integration?\n\nFor the integration to be successful, make sure the customer account used for OAuth verification adheres to Google’s [Customer Match policy](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/6299717) and has **Standard** or higher (**Administrative**) access level permissions. For more information on the access level permissions, refer to this [Google Ads support page](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/9978556?visit_id=637611563637058259-4176462731&rd=1).\n\nTo set the access level, follow these steps:\n\n1.  Sign into to your Google Ads account and go to **TOOLS AND SETTINGS** > **Access and security**:\n\n[![Access and Security option in Google Ads dashboard](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/gads-access-security.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/gads-access-security.webp)\n\n2.  Enter the email address of the account and from the list of permissions, select **Standard** or **Administrative**. Then, click **SEND INVITATION**:\n\n[![Specifying access levels](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/gads-specify-access-level.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-destinations/gads-specify-access-level.webp)\n\nThe account will have the access level permissions once they accept the invitation.\n\n#### I am getting a 400 Bad Request error message. What should I do?\n\nIf you get a 400 Bad Request error while configuring the destination, make sure your customer account is allow-listed and configured to have **Standard** or **Administrative** access levels in Google Ads. Refer to the above [FAQ](#what-are-the-account-permissions-required-for-this-integration) for steps on setting the access level permissions for the account.\n\nQuestions?

    "markdown": "# Feature Development | RudderStack Docs\n\nEnrich unified profiles with the required features/traits to drive targeted campaigns.\n\n* * *\n\n*     3 minute read  \n    \n\nOnce you have [performed identity stitching](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/profiles/core-concepts/identity-stitching/#how-to-perform-identity-stitching) to map the individual entities to known identifiers, you can use its output to enhance the unified profiles with additional data points and features.\n\nYou can define the features/traits in your warehouse tables and further perform calculations over this data to devise meaningful outcomes, which can help marketing teams to run effective campaigns.\n\n## Define features\n\nYou can use `var_group` to define features. Each `var_group` can have multiple entity vars which can be considered as features for that entity. The Profiles project generates and runs SQL in the background and automatically adds the resulting features to a [feature view](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/profiles/example/feature-views/).\n\nYou can produce a customer [feature view](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/profiles/example/feature-views/) or a feature view for specific projects like personalization, recommendations, or analytics.\n\nYou can combine the features to create even more features. You can also use [custom SQL queries](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/profiles/example/sql-model/) to enrich unified user profiles for advanced use cases.\n\nA sample `pb_project.yaml` file with a definition of a feature\\_view::\n\n```\n...\nentities:\n  - name: user\n    id_types:\n      - main_id\n      - user_id\n    feature_views:\n      using_ids:\n        - id: user_id\n```\n\nA sample configuration file to create `var_groups`:\n\n```\nvar_groups:\n  - name: user_vars\n    entity_key: user\n    vars:\n      - entity_var:\n          name: first_seen\n          select: min(timestamp::date)\n          from: inputs/rsTracks\n          is_feature: false\n      - entity_var:\n          name: last_seen\n          select: max(timestamp::date)\n          from: inputs/rsTracks\n          is_feature: false\n      - entity_var:\n          name: user_lifespan\n          select: '{{user.Var(\"last_seen\")}} - {{user.Var(\"first_seen\")}}'\n          description: Life Time Value of a customer\n      - entity_var:\n          name: days_active\n          select: count(distinct timestamp::date)\n          from: inputs/rsTracks\n          description: No. of days a customer was active\n# ID stitcher\nmodels:\n  - name: domain_profile_id_stitcher\n    model_type: id_stitcher\n    model_spec:\n      validity_time: 24h # 1 day\n      entity_key: user\n      materialization:\n        run_type: incremental\n      edge_sources:\n        - from: inputs/rsIdentifies\n        - from: inputs/rsTracks\n```\n\n## Benefits\n\n*   You can use the output of the identity graph to define or compute features based on given ID types. Feature views creates a view which will have all or a specified set of features on that entity from across the project based on the identifier column provided.\n*   As the number of features/traits increases, Profiles makes the maintenance process much easier by using a configuration file (as opposed to large and complex SQL queries).\n*   Profiles generates highly performant SQL to build feature views, which helps mitigate computing costs and engineering resources when the data sets become large, dependencies become complex, and features require data from multiple sources.\n\n### Use-cases\n\n*   Create analytics queries like demographic views, user activity views, etc.\n*   Send data using a [Reverse ETL](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/reverse-etl/) pipeline to various cloud destinations.\n*   Use RudderStack Audiences to send customer profiles to marketing tools (available for beta customers).\n*   Define traits/features using `entity_vars` and ML models and unify them using the Feature Views model.\n\n#### See also\n\n*   [Sample feature views project](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/profiles/example/feature-views/)\n*   [Sample SQL model project](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/profiles/example/sql-model/)\n\nQuestions?

    "markdown": "# Data Modeling | RudderStack Docs\n\nModel your unorganized and scattered warehouse data using RudderStack’s Profiles.\n\n* * *\n\n*     3 minute read  \n    \n\nProfiles models your organizational data by analyzing all the data in your warehouse to create unified customer profiles and enrich them with features to help you scale your business efficiently and swiftly.\n\nWhen you run the Profiles project, it creates an identity graph and feature views as outputs. You can augment the graph and create new user features by writing simple definitions in a configuration file or via SQL models.\n\n[![Profiles data modeling](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/profiles/data-modeling.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/profiles/data-modeling.webp)\n\n## Highlights\n\n*   Flexibility to use event stream, ETL, or any external tools as input sources.\n*   Support to define various entities like user, product, organization, etc.\n*   Intelligent merging of entities with different identifiers, like stitching Salesforce IDs.\n*   Ease of creating features/traits for any entity and using them to deliver personalization.\n*   Support to create core customer segments and activate them in downstream systems.\n*   Deal with advanced use-case scenarios using entity\\_vars/ML models.\n\n## Use varied input sources\n\nRudderStack Profiles gives you the flexibility of using a variety of input sources. These sources are essentially the tables or views which you can create using:\n\n*   [Event Stream](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/) (loaded from event data)\n*   ETL extract (loaded from [Cloud Extract](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/extract/) (loaded from event data))\n*   Existing tables in the warehouse (generated by external tools like DBT).\n\n## Define entities\n\nEntities refer to an object for which you can create a profile. RudderStack allows you to use the desired object as an entity. For example, user, customer, product, or any other object that requires profiling.\n\nYou can define the entities in `pb_project.yaml` file and use them declaratively while describing the columns of your input sources.\n\n## Unify entities\n\nOnce you define the entities, you can resolve different identities for an entity using the process of [identity stitching](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/profiles/core-concepts/identity-stitching/). It matches the different identifiers across multiple devices, digital touchpoints, and other data (like offline point-of-sale interactions) to build a comprehensive identity graph. The identity graph includes nodes (identifiers) and their relationships (edges), and it is generated as a transparent table in the warehouse.\n\nFor example, you can stitch Salesforce IDs or other ID types.\n\n## Enrich with features\n\nOnce you map all the available identifiers to an individual user or entity, it is easier to collect their traits and compute the user features you want in your customer 360 table.\n\nUsing the identity graph as a map, the Profiles **entity var** models let you define or perform calculations over the customer data in your warehouse. Each `var` materialises as a column in the `entity_var` table and represents a distinct feature. In addition, ML models can also use the identify graph as well as other entity vars, to create new features. Finally, **feature view** model lets you unify entity vars as well as ML faetures into a single view.\n\nYou don’t need any other tool or deep technical/SQL expertise to create these features. Trait definition is in a single unified framework and there is no need to move data across silos.\n\nTo implement advanced use cases, you can use [custom SQL queries](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/profiles/example/sql-model/) to define user features.\n\n## Define cohorts\n\nUsing cohorts, you can define core customer segments in the warehouse via a simple YAML config and the entire business can use them as a single source of truth. It is a subset of instances of an entity meeting a specified set of characteristics, behaviours, or attributes. For example, if you have user as an entity, you can define cohorts such as known users, new users, or North American users, etc.\n\nBy leveraging cohorts, you can target specific customer segments by enabling targeted campaigns and analysis. See [Cohorts](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/cloud-apps/auth0/) for more information.\n\nQuestions?
