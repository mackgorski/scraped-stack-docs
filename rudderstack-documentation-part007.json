    "markdown": "# Snowflake Quickstart Data | RudderStack Docs\n\nSample Data for Snowflake Quickstart Guide\n\n* * *\n\n*     2 minute read  \n    \n\nWe provide a sample data set for users walking through our Snowflake Quickstart Guide for Predictions. This dataset is available in the Snowflake marketplace.\n\nThe tables provide all of the needed data to run Profiles and Predictions jobs through the automated UI process as well as the code-based YAML workflow.\n\n## What tables are included in the data set?\n\nThe data set includes 4 tables of RudderStack event data:\n\n*   `PAGES` - page view events from anonymous and known users\n*   `TRACKS` - summarized tracked user actions (like login, signup, order\\_completed, etc.)\n*   `IDENTIFIES` - identify calls run when a user provides a unique identifier (i.e., upon singup)\n*   `ORDER_COMPLETED` - detailed payloads from tracked order\\_completed events\n\nAs of January 2023, here are the approximate number of rows in each table:\n\n*   `PAGES`: ~43k\n*   `TRACKS`: ~14k\n*   `IDENTIFIES`: ~4.8k\n*   `ORDER_COMPLETED`: ~2.2k\n\nThese volumes follow the pattern of a normal eCommerce conversion funnel (pageview, signup, order). Specifically, here’s a rough breakdown of the user journey by volume:\n\n*   30% - never sign in\n*   10% - sign in but never add an item to cart\n*   40% - add to cart and abandon\n*   20% - make purchases\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Note that this data includes _future_ data until Apr 2024, and starts in June 2023. This is to ensure that future users can still run the project with ‘current’ data. Our team will refresh the data periodically throughout the year.\n\n## What properties are included in the data set?\n\nThis data set includes a _subset_ of the standard properties found in our [Warehouse Schema Spec](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/warehouse-destinations/warehouse-schema/) for each table.\n\nThe required columns for running Profiles and Predictions projects are present.\n\nNote that we intentionally limited the number of columns to make the data set easily understandable.\n\n### What user information is included in the data set?\n\nThis data set contains a total of ~10k unique users by anonymousId. About half of those unique users (~4.8k) are known users (with an associated identify call).\n\nUser data includes a subset of our standard properties for `identify` calls. (We intentionally limited the number of columns to make the data set easily understandable. )\n\nAll of the email addresses were randomly generated and no PII was used in the generation of this data set.\n\nQuestions?

The basic syntax of executing a command is:\n\n```\n$ pb <command> <subcommand> [parameters]\n```\n\n## Supported commands\n\nYou can use the following Profile Builder commands:\n\n### cleanup\n\nDisplays and removes materials, older than the retention time period specified by the user (default value is 180 days).\n\n```\npb cleanup materials -r <number of days>\n```\n\n**Optional Parameter**\n\n| Parameter | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `-r` | Retention time in number of days.<br><br>**Example**: If you pass 1, then all the materials created prior to one day (24 hours) are listed. This is followed by prompts asking you for confirmation, after which you can view the material names and delete them. |\n\n### compile\n\nGenerates SQL queries from models.\n\nIt creates SQL queries from the `models/profiles.yaml` file, storing the generated results in the **Output** subfolder in the project’s folder. With each run, a new folder is created inside it. You can manually execute these SQL files on the warehouse.\n\n**Optional parameters**\n\n| Parameter | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `clean_output` | Empties the output folder(s) before executing the command. |\n| `-c` | Uses a site configuration file other than the one in `.pb` directory.<br><br>**Example**: `$ pb compile -c MyOtherConnection/siteconfig.yaml` |\n| `-t` | Defines target name (mentioned in `siteconfig.yaml`) or timestamp in building the model.<br><br>**Example**: If your `siteconfig.yaml` has two targets, `dev` and `test`, and you want to use the `test` instance: `$ pb compile -t test` |\n| `--timestamp` | *   Runs the model now (default).  <br>    **Example**: `$ pb compile --timestamp now`.<br>  <br>*   Utilizes all the data in source tables regardless of timestamp.  <br>    **Example**:`$ pb compile --timestamp timeless`.<br>  <br>*   Utilizes data until a user-defined timestamp (epoch).  <br>    **Example**: `$ pb compile --timestamp 1659794654` |\n| `-p` | *   Uses a project file (`pb_project.yaml`) other than the one in current directory.  <br>    **Example**: `$ pb compile -p MyOtherProject`.<br>  <br>*   Fetches project from a URL such as GitHub.  <br>    **Example**:`$ pb compile -p git@github.com:<orgname>/<repo>`.

To use connection named red:\n$ pb insert -n red\n# To pick up connection named red, with target test .\n$ pb insert -n red -t test\n```\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> This command is supported only for Snowflake currently.\n\n### migrate\n\nMigrate your project to the latest schema.\n\n**Subcommands**\n\nBased on the current schema version of your project, it enlists all the steps needed to migrate it to the latest one.\n\nAutomatically migrate from one version to another.\n\nTo migrate your models:\n\n**Schema 18 -> 43:**\n\nNavigate to the folder where your project files are stored. Then execute one of the following:\n\n*   `pb migrate auto --inplace`: Replaces contents of existing folder with the migrated folder.\n*   `pb migrate auto -d <MigratedFolder>`: Keeps the original project intact and stores the migrated project in another folder.\n\n**Schema 43 -> 44:**\n\nUse `{{entity-name.Var(var-name)}}` to refer to an `entity-var` or an `input-var`.\n\nFor example, for entity\\_var `user_lifespan` in your HelloPbProject, change `select: last_seen - first_seen` to `select: '{{user.Var(\"last_seen\")}} - {{user.Var(\"first_seen\")}}'`.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> Note that:\n> \n> *   You must use two curly brackets.\n> *   Anything contained within double curly brackets must be written in double quotes (`\" \"`). If you use single quotes within double quotes, then use the escape character (`\\`) that comes when using macros.\n\n**Linear dependency**\n\nSpecify this parameter when entity as vars migration is not done (till version 43). After the migration is done, it’s not necessary to mention this parameter and can be removed.\n\n```\n  compatibility_mode:\n    linear_dependency_of_vars: true\n```\n\n**Optional parameters**\n\n| Parameter | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `-p` | Uses a project file other than the one in current directory. |\n| `-c` | Uses a `siteconfig.yaml` file other than the one in your home directory. |\n| `-t` | Target name (defaults to the one specified in `siteconfig.yaml` file). |\n| `-v` | Version to which the project needs to be migrated (defaults to the latest version). |\n| `-d` | Destination folder to store the migrated project files.<br><br>**Example**: `pb migrate auto -d FolderName` |\n| `--force` | Ignores warnings (if any) and migrates the project. |\n| `--inplace` | Overwrites the source folder and stores migrated project files in place of original.<br><br>**Example**: `pb migrate auto --inplace` |\n| `-p` | Uses a project folder other than the one in current directory.<br><br>**Example**: `$ pb discover -p ThisFolder/ThatSubFolder/SomeOtherProject/` |\n| `-f` | Specifies a file path to dump the discovery output into a csv file.<br><br>**Example**: `$ pb discover -f path/to/csv_file.csv` |\n| `-k` | Restricts discovery of the specified model keys.<br><br>**Example**: `$ pb discover -k entity_key:mode_type:model_name` |\n\n### run\n\nCreates identity stitcher or feature table model in the Warehouse.\n\nIt generates the SQL files from models and executes them in the warehouse. Once executed, you can see the output table names, which are accessible from the warehouse.\n\n**Optional parameters**\n\nThe `run` command shares the same parameters as the [`compile`](#compile) command, in addition to the following ones:\n\n| Parameter | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `--force` | Does a force run even if the material already exists. |\n| `-- write_output_csv` | Writes all the generated tables to CSV files in the specified directory.<br><br>**Example**: `$ pb run -- WriteOutputHere.csv` |\n| `--model_args` | Customizes behavior of an individual model by passing configuration params to it.<br><br>The only argument type supported currently is `breakpoint` for feature table models.<br><br>The `breakpoint` parameter lets you generate and run SQL only till a specific feature/tablevar. You can specify it in the format `modelName:argType:argName` where argName is the name of feature/tablevar.<br><br>**Example**: `$ pb run --model_args domain_profile:breakpoint:salesforceEvents` |\n| `--ignore_model_errors` | Allows the project to continue to run in case of an erroneous model. The execution will not stop due to one bad model. |\n| `--grep_var_dependencies` | Uses regex pattern matching over fields from vars to find references to other vars and set dependencies. By default, it is set to `true`. |\n\n### show\n\nObtains a comprehensive overview of models, id\\_clusters, packages, and more in a project. Its capacity to provide detailed information makes it particularly useful when searching for specific details, like all the models in your project.\n\n**Subcommands**\n\n1.  `pb show models`\n\nThis command lets you view information about the models in your project. The output includes the following information about each model:\n\n*   **Warehouse name**: Name of the table/view to be created in the warehouse.\n*   **Model type**: Whether its an identity stitching, feature table, SQL model etc.\n*   **Output type**: Whether the output type is `ephemeral`, `table`, or `view`.\n*   **Run type**: Whether the model’s run type is `discrete` or `incremental`.\n*   **SQL type**: Whether the SQL type of the model is `single_sql` or `multi_sql`.\n\n2.  `pb show dependencies`\n\nThis subcommand generates a graph file (`dependencies.png`) highlighting the dependencies of all models in your project.\n\n3.  `pb show dataflow`\n\nThis subcommand generates a graph file (`dataflow.png`) highlighting the data flow of all models in your project.\n\n4.  `pb show idstitcher-report models/<ModelName> --migrate_on_load`\n\nThis subcommand creates a detailed report about the identity stitching model runs. By default, it picks up the last run, which can be changed using flag `-l`. The output consists of:\n\n*   **ModelRef**: The model reference name.\n*   **Seq No**: Sequence number of the run for which you are creating the report.\n*   **Material Name**: Output name as created in warehouse.\n*   **Creation Time**: Time when the material object was created.\n*   **Model Converged**: Indicates a successful run if `true`.\n*   **Pre Stitched IDs before run**: Count of all the IDs before stitching.\n*   **Post Stitched IDs after run**: Count of unique IDs after stitching.\n\nProfile Builder also generates a HTML report with relevant results and graphics including largest cluster, ID graph, etc. It is saved in `output` folder and the exact path is shown on screen when you execute the command.\n\n5.  `pb show user-lookup -v '<trait value>'`\n\nThis subcommand lists all the features associated with a user using any of the traits (flag `-v`) as ID types (email, user id, etc. that you are trying to discover).\n\n**Optional parameters**\n\n| Parameter | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `-h` | Displays help information for the command. |\n| `-p` | Specifies the project path to list the models.

Control Plane Lite lets you manage your data pipelines locally by exporting or importing your configurations from a JSON file.\n\n> ![danger](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/danger.svg)\n> \n> [Control Plane Lite](https://github.com/rudderlabs/config-generator) is now deprecated. It will not work with the latest [`rudder-server`](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-server) versions (after v1.2).\n> \n> **Using [RudderStack Open Source](#control-plane-setup) to set up your control plane is strongly recommended.**\n> \n> Though we encourage contributions from the open-source community, note that RudderStack will not support any new functionality for Control Plane Lite.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nBefore using Control Plane Lite to set up your self-hosted control plane, ensure you have installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v14.17.3/).\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> Use Node.js v14 for the best experience, as the higher versions are not supported.\n\n## Control plane setup\n\n1.  Clone the [RudderStack Control Plane Lite](https://github.com/rudderlabs/config-generator) repository.\n2.  Open your terminal and navigate to the **Config Generator** folder. Then, run the following commands:\n\n3.  After the setup is complete, you can access the dashboard at `http://localhost:3000`.\n\n[![Control Plane Lite dashboard](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/rudderstack-open-source/control-plane-lite-dashboard.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/rudderstack-open-source/control-plane-lite-dashboard.webp)\n\n## Export workspace configuration\n\n1.  Set up your connections by adding the sources and destinations in the dashboard.\n2.  Click the **EXPORT** button on the top right to export your workspace configuration as a JSON file.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack requires this JSON file (`workspaceConfig.json`) to start the RudderStack server.\n\n## Data plane setup and usage\n\nDepending on your setup environment, follow the steps in the below sections to start the RudderStack server (data plane) using the exported workspace configuration file.\n\n### Docker\n\n1.  Download and open [`rudder-docker.yml`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rudderlabs/rudder-server/master/rudder-docker.yml).\n2.  In the `environment` section under `backend` service, uncomment the following lines:\n\n```\n  - RSERVER_BACKEND_CONFIG_CONFIG_FROM_FILE=true\n  - RSERVER_BACKEND_CONFIG_CONFIG_JSONPATH=<workspace_config_filepath_in_container>\n```\n\n3.  Replace `<workspace_config_filepath_in_container>` in the above line with your container file path. By default, you can set it to `/etc/rudderstack/workspaceConfig.json`.\n4.  In the `volumes` section under the `backend` service, uncomment the following line:\n\n```\n  - <absolute_path_to_workspace_config>:<workspace_config_filepath_in_container>\n```\n\n5.  Replace `<absolute_path_to_workspace_config>` with the local path of your `workspaceConfig.json`(where your workspace configuration file is saved locally). Also, replace `<workspace_config_filepath_in_container>` with the container file path set in Step 3.\n\n[![Rudder Docker YML file](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/rudderstack-open-source/rudder-docker-yml-file.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/rudderstack-open-source/rudder-docker-yml-file.webp)\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> The value for `<workspace_config_filepath_in_container>` should be exactly as the value you set for the `RSERVER_BACKEND_CONFIG_CONFIG_JSONPATH` variable. Otherwise, your workspace configuration will not be loaded, and you will get an error.\n\n6.  Navigate to the directory where the RudderStack data plane (`rudder-server`) is installed and run the following command:\n\n```\ndocker-compose -f rudder-docker.yml up\n```\n\n7.  [Send test events](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/get-started/rudderstack-open-source/sending-test-events/) to verify your installation.\n\n### Kubernetes\n\n1.  Clone the [RudderStack Helm repository](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudderstack-helm) containing the Helm chart:\n\n```\ngit clone git@github.com:rudderlabs/rudderstack-helm.git\n```\n\n2.  Navigate to the folder.\n\n3.  Open the `values.yaml` file.\n4.  Set the `controlPlaneJSON` parameter to `true`.\n5.  Export the workspace configuration by following the steps in [Export workspace configuration](#export-workspace-configuration). Place the exported file in the `rudderstack-helm` folder.\n6.  Run the following command:\n\n```\nhelm install my-release ./ --set backend.controlPlaneJSON=true\n```\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> See [Configuration](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/get-started/rudderstack-open-source/data-plane-setup/kubernetes/#configuration) for information on the configurable parameters during deployment.\n\n7.  [Send test events](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/get-started/rudderstack-open-source/sending-test-events/) to verify your installation.\n\n### Developer machine setup\n\n1.  Set up the database in your preferred directory:\n\n```\ncreatedb jobsdb\ncreateuser --superuser rudder\npsql \"jobsdb\" -c \"alter user rudder with encrypted password 'rudder'\";\npsql \"jobsdb\" -c \"grant all privileges on database jobsdb to rudder\";\n```\n\n2.  Clone the [`rudder-server`](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-server) repository.\n3.  Run `git submodule init` and `git submodule update` to fetch the `rudder-transformer` repository.\n4.  Navigate to the `rudder-transformer` directory using the `cd rudder-transformer` command.\n5.  Install the dependencies using the `npm i` command.\n6.  Start the destination transformer:\n\n6.  Navigate back to the main directory using the `cd rudder-server` command.\n7.  Copy `sample.env` to the main directory:\n\n```\ncp config/sample.env .env\n```\n\n8.  Go to the `config` folder and open `config.yaml`.\n9.  Under `[BackendConfig]`, look for `configFromFile`, and set it to `true`.\n10.  Change the value of `configJSONPath` to the local path of your `workspaceConfig.json`(where your workspace configuration file is saved locally):\n\n[![RudderStack config JSON path](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/rudderstack-open-source/rudder-config-1.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/rudderstack-open-source/rudder-config-1.webp)\n\n11.  Run the RudderStack server using the following command:\n\n12.  [Send test events](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/get-started/rudderstack-open-source/sending-test-events/) to verify your installation.\n\n## Use SDK sources in self-hosted control plane\n\nTo use the RudderStack SDKs set up in the self-hosted control plane, follow these steps:\n\n1.  [Set up the control plane](#control-plane-setup) using Control Plane Lite.\n2.  Go to the dashboard, set up your source, and export the source configuration by clicking the **EXPORT SOURCE CONFIG** button:\n\n[![Export source config option](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/rudderstack-open-source/export-source-config.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/rudderstack-open-source/export-source-config.webp)\n\n3.  Host the exported file on your server such that it can be accessed via the path `<CONTROL_PLANE_URL>/sourceConfig`.\n4.

    "markdown": "# Ruby SDK (Synchronous) | RudderStack Docs\n\nUse RudderStack’s Ruby SDK to send server-side events to various destinations.\n\n* * *\n\n*     8 minute read  \n    \n\nRudderStack’s Ruby SDK lets you track and send the events from your Ruby applications to the specified destinations.\n\n> ![danger](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/danger.svg)\n> \n> The synchronous version of the Ruby SDK will be deprecated soon.\n\nRefer to the SDK’s [GitHub codebase](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-sdk-ruby-sync) for the implementation-specific details.\n\n[![Github Badge](https://img.shields.io/gem/v/rudder_analytics_sync?style=flat)](https://rubygems.org/gems/rudder_analytics_sync/)\n\n## SDK setup requirements\n\n1.  Sign up to [RudderStack Cloud](https://app.rudderstack.com/signup).\n2.  [Set up a Ruby source](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/dashboard-guides/sources/#adding-a-source) in your dashboard. You should be able to see a **write key** for this source.\n\nYou will also need a data plane URL. Refer to the [Dashboard Overview](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/dashboard-guides/overview/#data-plane-url) guide for more information on the data plane URL and where to find it.\n\n> ![success](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/tick.svg)\n> \n> The **Setup** tab in the RudderStack dashboard has the SDK installation snippet containing both the write key and the data plane URL. Copy it to integrate the Ruby SDK into your application.\n\n## Installing the Ruby SDK\n\nTo install the RudderStack Ruby SDK, add the following line to your application’s Gem file:\n\n```\ngem 'rudder_analytics_sync'\n```\n\nYou can also install it by running the following command:\n\n```\ngem install rudder_analytics_sync\n```\n\n## Initializing the SDK\n\nTo initialize the SDK, create a client instance as shown below:\n\n```\nanalytics = RudderAnalyticsSync::Client.new(\n  write_key: 'WRITE_KEY', # Required\n  data_plane_url: 'DATA_PLANE_URL',\n  gzip: true,  # Set to false to disable Gzip compression\n  on_error: proc { |error_code, error_body, exception, response|\n    # defaults to an empty proc\n  }\n)\n```\n\n### Batching events\n\nTo manually batch events, use `Analytics.batch` as shown:\n\n```\nAnalytics.batch do |batch|\n  batch.context = {...}       # shared context for all events\n  batch.integrations = {...}  # shared integrations hash for all events\n  batch.identify(...)\n  batch.track(...)\n  batch.track(...)\n  ...\nend\n```\n\n## Gzipping requests\n\n> ![success](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/tick.svg)\n> \n> The Gzip feature is enabled by default in the Ruby SDK version 2.0.0.\n\nThe Ruby SDK automatically gzips requests. However, you can disable this feature by setting the `Gzip` parameter to `false` while initializing the SDK:\n\n```\nanalytics = RudderAnalyticsSync::Client.new(\n  write_key: 'WRITE_KEY', # required\n  data_plane_url: 'DATA_PLANE_URL',\n  gzip: false, # Set to true to enable Gzip compression\n  on_error: proc { |error_code, error_body, exception, response|\n    # defaults to an empty proc\n  }\n)\n```\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> Gzip requires [rudder-server](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-server) **v1.4 or higher**. Otherwise, your events might fail.\n\n## SDK initialization options\n\nThe RudderStack Ruby SDK provides the following initialization options:\n\n| Field | Type | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `write_key`  <br>Required | String | Source [write keyThe write key (or source write key) is a unique identifier for your source. RudderStack uses this key to send events from a source to the specified destination.](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/resources/glossary/#write-key) . |\n| `data_plane_url`  <br>Required | String | Your [data plane URLThe data plane URL is the location where events are routed and sent to the RudderStack backend for processing. You can find this URL in the home page of your RudderStack dashboard.](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/resources/glossary/#data-plane-url) . |\n| `stub` | Boolean | Stubs the event requests.<br><br>**Default value**: `false` |\n| `gzip` | Boolean | Gzips the event requests.<br><br>**Default value**: `true` |\n| `http_options` | Dictionary | Additional HTTP options. For example, `{use_ssl: True}` |\n\n## Sending events\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> **RudderStack does not store or persist the user state in any of the server-side SDKs**.\n> \n> Unlike the client-side SDKs that deal with only a single user at a given time, the server-side SDKs deal with multiple users simultaneously. Therefore, you must specify either the `user_id` or `anonymous_id` **every time** while making any API calls supported by the Ruby SDK.\n\n### Identify\n\nThe [`identify`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/identify/) call lets you identify a visiting user and associate them to their actions. It also lets you record the traits about them like their name, email address, etc.\n\nA sample `identify` call made using the Ruby SDK is shown below:\n\n```\nAnalytics.identify(\n  user_id: '1hKOmRA4GRlm',\n  traits: { email: \"alex@example.com\", friends: 1 },\n  context: {ip: '10.81.20.10'}\n)\n```\n\nThe `identify` method parameters are as shown:\n\n| **Field** | **Type** | **Description** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `user_id`  <br>Required, if **anonymous\\_id** is absent. | String | Unique identifier for a user in your database. |\n| `anonymous_id`  <br>Required, if **user\\_id** is absent. | String | Use this field to set an identifier in cases where there is no unique user identifier. |\n| `traits` | Object | An optional dictionary of the user’s traits like `name` or `email`. |\n| `context` | Object | An optional dictionary of information that provides context about the event. It is not directly related to the API call. |\n| `integrations` | Object | An optional dictionary containing the destinations to be either enabled or disabled. |\n| `timestamp` | Timestamp in ISO 8601 format | The timestamp of the event’s arrival. |\n\n### Track\n\nThe [`track`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/track/) call lets you record the user actions along with their associated properties. Each user action is called an **event**.\n\nA sample `track` call is shown below:\n\n```\nAnalytics.track(\n  user_id: '1hKOmRA4GRlm',\n  event: 'Item Sold',\n  properties: { revenue: 9.95, shipping: 'Free' }\n)\n```\n\nThe `track` method parameters are as described below:\n\n| **Field** | **Type** | **Description** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `user_id`  <br>Required, if **anonymous\\_id** is absent. | String | Unique identifier for a user in your database. |\n| `anonymous_id`  <br>Required, if **user\\_id** is absent. | String | Use this field to set an identifier in cases where there is no unique user identifier. |\n| `event`  <br>Required | String | Name of the event. |\n| `properties` | Object | An optional dictionary of the properties associated with the event. |\n| `context` | Object | An optional dictionary of information that provides context about the event. It is not directly related to the API call. |\n| `timestamp` | Timestamp in ISO 8601 format | The timestamp of the event’s arrival. |\n| `integrations` | Object | An optional dictionary containing the destinations to be either enabled or disabled. |\n\n### Page\n\nThe [`page`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/page/) call lets you record the page views on your application along with the other relevant information about the page.\n\nA sample `page` call is as shown:\n\n```\nAnalytics.page(\n  user_id: `1hKOmRA4GRlm`,\n  category: 'Food',\n  name: 'Pizza',\n  properties: { url: 'https://dominos.com' }\n)\n```\n\nThe `page` method parameters are as described below:\n\n| **Field** | **Type** | **Description** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `user_id`  <br>Required, if **anonymous\\_id** is absent. | String | Unique identifier for a user in your database. |\n| `anonymous_id`  <br>Required, if **user\\_id** is absent. | String | Use this field to set an identifier in cases where there is no unique user identifier. |\n| `name`  <br>Required | String | Name of the viewed page. |\n| `properties` | Object | An optional dictionary of the properties associated with the viewed page, like `url` or `referrer`. |\n| `integrations` | Object | An optional dictionary containing the destinations to be either enabled or disabled. |\n| `context` | Object | An optional dictionary of information that provides context about the event. It is not directly related to the API call. |\n| `timestamp` | Timestamp in ISO 8601 format | The timestamp of the event’s arrival. |\n\n### Screen\n\n> ![success](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/tick.svg)\n> \n> From version 2.0.0, the Ruby SDK supports `screen` events.\n\nThe [`screen`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/screen/) call is the mobile equivalent of the [`page`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/page/) call. It lets you record the screen views on your mobile app along with other relevant information about the screen.\n\nA sample `screen` call is as shown:\n\n```\nAnalytics.screen(\n  user_id: `1hKOmRA4GRlm`,\n  category: 'Food',\n  name: 'Pizza',\n  properties: { url: 'https://dominos.com' }\n)\n```\n\nThe `screen` method parameters are as described below:\n\n| **Field** | **Type** | **Description** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `user_id`  <br>Required, if **anonymous\\_id** is absent. | String | Unique identifier for a user in your database. |\n| `anonymous_id`  <br>Required, if **user\\_id** is absent. | String | Use this field to set an identifier in cases where there is no unique user identifier. |\n| `name`  <br>Required | String | Name of the viewed screen. |\n| `properties` | Object | An optional dictionary of the properties associated with the viewed screen, like `url` or `referrer`. |\n| `integrations` | Object | An optional dictionary containing the destinations to be either enabled or disabled. |\n| `context` | Object | An optional dictionary of information that provides context about the event. It is not directly related to the API call. |\n| `timestamp` | Timestamp in ISO 8601 format | The timestamp of the event’s arrival. |\n\n### Group\n\nThe [`group`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/group/) call lets you link an identified user with a group, such as a company, organization, or an account. It also lets you record any custom traits or properties associated with that group.\n\nA sample `group` call made using the Ruby SDK is shown below:\n\n```\nAnalytics.group(\n  user_id: '1hKOmRA4GRlm',\n  group_id: '12',\n  traits: { name: 'Company', description: 'Software'}\n)\n```\n\nThe `group` method parameters are as follows:\n\n| **Field** | **Type** | **Description** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `user_id`  <br>Required, if **anonymous\\_id** is absent. | String | Unique identifier for a user in your database. |\n| `anonymous_id`  <br>Required, if **user\\_id** is absent. | String | Use this field to set an identifier in cases where there is no unique user identifier. |\n| `group_id`  <br>Required | String | Unique identifier of the group in your database. |\n| `traits` | Object | An optional dictionary of the group’s traits like `name`or `email`. |\n| `integrations` | Object | An optional dictionary containing the destinations to be either enabled or disabled. |\n| `context` | Object | An optional dictionary of information that provides context about the event. It is not directly related to the API call. |\n| `timestamp` | Timestamp in ISO 8601 format | The timestamp of the event’s arrival. |\n\n### Alias\n\nThe [`alias`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/alias/) call lets you merge different identities of a known user. It is an advanced method that lets you change the tracked user’s ID explicitly. You can use `alias` for managing the user’s identity in some of the downstream destinations.\n\nA sample `alias` call is as shown:\n\n```\nAnalytics.alias(previous_id: '1hKOmRA4GRlm', user_id: '12345')\n```\n\nThe `alias` method parameters are as mentioned below:\n\n| **Field** | **Type** | **Description** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `user_id`  <br>Required, if **anonymous\\_id** is absent. | String | Unique identifier for a user in your database. |\n| `anonymous_id`  <br>Required, if **user\\_id** is absent. | String | Use this field to set an identifier in cases where there is no unique user identifier. |\n| `previous_id`  <br>Required | String | The previous unique identifier of the user. |\n| `traits` | Object | An optional dictionary of the user’s traits like `name` or `email`. |\n| `integrations` | Object | An optional dictionary containing the destinations to be either enabled or disabled. |\n| `context` | Object | An optional dictionary of information that provides context about the event. It is not directly related to the API call. |\n| `timestamp` | Timestamp in ISO 8601 format | The timestamp of the event’s arrival. |\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### Does the Ruby SDK support event ordering?\n\nThe Ruby SDK does not support event ordering by default.\n\nQuestions?

With this update, RudderStack sends all events to Mixpanel by leveraging only the `/import` endpoint.\n\nThis change offers a higher batch limit, supports Gzip event compression, and supports ingestion of historical data, along with several other improvements.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Note that with this update, you should expect additional merge calls in your Mixpanel profile feed.\n\nFor more details, see [Mixpanel’s documentation](https://developer.mixpanel.com/reference/track-event).\n\n### Deprecation of API Secret dashboard setting\n\nWe have also removed the **API Secret** setting which was used to set up the Mixpanel destination in RudderStack.\n\nRudderStack now uses the **API Token** or **Service Account** credentials [provided in the dashboard](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/mixpanel/setup-guide/#connection-settings) to authenticate the `/import` API to send all events to Mixpanel.\n\nSee our [Mixpanel documentation](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/mixpanel/) for more information.\n\nQuestions?

    "markdown": "# Flutter SDK v1 | RudderStack Docs\n\nUse the RudderStack Flutter SDK to send events from your Flutter applications to various destinations.\n\n* * *\n\n*     12 minute read  \n    \n\nThe **RudderStack Flutter SDK** lets you track event data from your Flutter applications and send it to your specified destinations via RudderStack.\n\nRefer to the [Flutter SDK GitHub Repository](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-sdk-flutter) to get a more hands-on understanding of the SDK and the related codebase.\n\n[![Github Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/pub-v1.2.0-blue?style=flat)](https://pub.dev/packages/rudder_sdk_flutter/versions/1.2.0)\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> It is strongly recommended to update your Flutter SDK to the latest version to get all the features, including **web support**. Refer to the [SDK documentation](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-flutter-sdk/) for more information.\n\n## SDK setup requirements\n\nTo set up the RudderStack Flutter SDK, you need the following prerequisites:\n\n*   You will need to set up a [RudderStack Account](https://app.rudderstack.com/).\n*   Once signed up, you need to [set up a Flutter source](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/dashboard-guides/sources/#adding-a-source) in the dashboard. You should be able to see a **Write Key** for this source:\n\n[![Flutter source write key](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-sources/flutter-write-key-new.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/event-stream-sources/flutter-write-key-new.webp)\n\n*   You will also need a data plane URL. Refer to the [Glossary](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/resources/glossary/#data-plane-url) for more information on the data plane URL and where to find it.\n*   It is also recommended to set up the [Flutter development environment](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) in your system.\n\n> ![success](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/tick.svg)\n> \n> Starting from v1.0.2, the RudderStack Flutter SDK is migrated to Null Safety.\n\n## Installing the RudderStack Flutter SDK\n\nThe recommended way to install the Flutter SDK is through [`pub`](https://pub.dev/packages/rudder_sdk_flutter).\n\nFollow the steps below to add the SDK as a dependency:\n\n1.  Open `pubspec.yaml` and add `rudder_sdk_flutter` under `dependencies` section:\n\n```\ndependencies:\n  rudder_sdk_flutter: ^1.2.0\n```\n\n2.  Navigate to your application’s root folder and install all required dependencies with the following command:\n\n## Initializing the RudderStack client\n\nAfter adding the SDK as a dependency, you need to set up the SDK.\n\n1.  To import the SDK, use the following snippet:\n\n```\nimport 'package:rudder_sdk_flutter/RudderClient.dart';\nimport 'package:rudder_sdk_flutter/RudderConfig.dart';\nimport 'package:rudder_sdk_flutter/RudderLogger.dart';\n```\n\n2.  Then, add the following code snippet in your application:\n\n```\nfinal RudderController rudderClient = RudderController.instance;\nRudderLogger.init(RudderLogger.VERBOSE);\nRudderConfigBuilder builder = RudderConfigBuilder();\nbuilder.withDataPlaneUrl(<DATA_PLANE_URL>);\nbuilder.withTrackLifecycleEvents(true);\nrudderClient.initialize(<WRITE_KEY>,config: builder.build());\n```\n\nThe `initialize` method has the following signature:\n\n| Name | Type | Presence | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `writeKey` | String | Required | Your Flutter source write key. |\n| `config` | `RudderConfig` | Optional | Contains the RudderStack client configuration |\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Check the [Configuring your RudderStack client](#configuring-your-rudderstack-client) section below for a complete list of the configurable parameters.\n\n## Configuring your RudderStack Client\n\nYou can configure your client based on the following parameters by passing them in the `RudderConfigBuilder` object of your `rudderClient.initialize()` call.\n\n| Parameter | Type | Description | Default value |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `logLevel` | Integer | Controls how much of the log you want to see from the Flutter SDK. | `RudderLogger.RudderLogLevel.NONE` |\n| `dataPlaneUrl` | String | Your data plane URL. | `https://hosted.rudderlabs.com` |\n| `flushQueueSize` | Integer | Number of events in a batch request to the server. | `30` |\n| `dbThresholdCount` | Integer | Number of events to be saved in the SQLite database. Once this limit is reached, the older events are deleted from the database. | `10000` |\n| `sleepTimeout` | Integer | Minimum waiting time to flush the events to the server. | `10 seconds` |\n| `configRefreshInterval` | Integer | Fetches the config from the dashboard after this specified time. | `2` |\n| `trackLifecycleEvents` | Boolean | Determines if the SDK will capture application life cycle events automatically. | `true` |\n| `autoCollectAdvertId` | Boolean | Determines if the SDK will collect the advertisement ID. | `false` |\n| `controlPlaneUrl` | String | This parameter should be changed **only if** you are self-hosting the control plane. Check the section [Self-hosted control plane](#self-hosted-control-plane) section below for more information. The SDK will add `/sourceConfig` along with this URL to fetch the configuration. | `https://api.rudderlabs.com` |\n\n## Identify\n\nRudderStack captures `deviceId` and uses that as the `anonymousId` for identifying the user. This helps to track the users across the application installation. To attach more information to the user, you can use the `identify` method.\n\nFor a detailed explanation of the `identify` call, refer to the [RudderStack API Specification](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/identify/).\n\nOnce a user is identified, the SDK persists all user information and passes it to the successive `track` or `screen` calls. To reset the user identification, you can use the `reset` method.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> On the Android devices, the `deviceId` is assigned during the first boot. It remains consistent across the applications and installs. This can be changed only after a factory reset of the device.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> According to the [Apple documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uidevice/1620059-identifierforvendor), if the iOS device has multiple apps from the same vendor, all apps will be assigned the same `deviceId`. If all applications from a vendor are uninstalled and then reinstalled, then they will be assigned a new `deviceId`.\n\nA sample `identify` event is as shown:\n\n```\nRudderTraits traits = RudderTraits();\ntraits.putBirthdayDate(new DateTime.now());\ntraits.putEmail(\"abc@123.com\");\ntraits.putFirstName(\"Alex\");\ntraits.putLastName(\"Keener\");\ntraits.putGender(\"M\");\ntraits.putPhone(\"1234567890\");\n\nAddress address = Address();\naddress.putCity(\"New Orleans\");\naddress.putCountry(\"USA\");\ntraits.putAddress(address);\n\ntraits.put(\"boolean\", true);\ntraits.put(\"integer\", 50);\ntraits.put(\"float\", 120.4);\ntraits.put(\"long\", 1234);\ntraits.put(\"string\", \"hello\");\ntraits.put(\"date\", new DateTime.now().millisecondsSinceEpoch);\n\nrudderClient.identify(\"test_user_id\", traits: traits, options: null);\n```\n\nThe `identify` method has the following signature:\n\n| Name | Data Type | Presence | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `userId` | String | Required | Includes the developer identity for the user. |\n| `traits` | `RudderTraits` | Optional | Contains information related to the user traits. |\n| `options` | `RudderOption` | Optional | Extra options for the `identify` event. |\n\n### Obtaining user traits after making an `identify` call\n\nYou can obtain the user traits after making an `identify` call as shown:\n\n```\nMap context = await rudderClient.getRudderContext();\nprint(context[\"traits\"]);\n```\n\n## Track\n\nYou can record the users’ activity through the `track` method. Each user action is called an event.\n\nFor a detailed explanation of the `track` call, refer to the [RudderStack API Specification](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/track/).\n\nA sample `track` event is shown below:\n\n```\nRudderProperty property = RudderProperty();\nproperty.put(\"test_key_1\", \"test_key_1\");\nRudderProperty childProperty = RudderProperty();\nchildProperty.put(\"test_child_key_1\", \"test_child_value_1\");\nproperty.put(\"test_key_2\",childProperty);\nrudderClient.track(\"test_track_event\", properties: property);\n```\n\nThe `track` method has the following signature:\n\n| Name | Type | Presence | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `name` | String | Required | Contains the name of the event you want to track. |\n| `properties` | `RudderProperty` | Optional | Contains the extra properties you want to send along with the event. |\n| `options` | `RudderOption` | Optional | Contains the extra event options. |\n\n## Screen\n\nYou can use the `screen` call to record whenever the user views a screen on their mobile device along with the properties associated with that event.\n\nFor a detailed explanation of the `screen` call, refer to the [RudderStack API Specification](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/screen/) guide.\n\nA sample `screen` event is as shown:\n\n```\nRudderProperty screenProperty = new RudderProperty();\nscreenProperty.put(\"foo\", \"bar\");\nrudderClient.screen(\"Main Activity\",\n    properties: screenProperty, options: null);\n```\n\nThe `screen` method has the following signature:\n\n| Name | Type | Presence | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `screenName` | String | Required | Name of the screen viewed by the user. |\n| `properties` | `RudderProperty` | Optional | Extra property object that you want to pass along with the `screen` call. |\n| `options` | `RudderOption` | Optional | Extra options to be passed along with `screen` event. |\n\n## Group\n\nThe `group` call associates a user to a specific organization.\n\nFor a detailed explanation of the `group` call, refer to the [RudderStack Event Specification](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/group/) guide.\n\nA sample `group` event is shown below:\n\n```\nRudderTraits groupTraits = RudderTraits();\ngroupTraits.put(\"foo\", \"bar\");\ngroupTraits.put(\"foo1\", \"bar1\");\nrudderClient.group(\"sample_group_id\",\n    groupTraits: groupTraits, options: null);\n```\n\nThe `group` method has the following signature:\n\n| Name | Type | Presence | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `groupId` | `String` | Required | The ID of the organization with which you want to associate your user. |\n| `groupTraits` | `RudderTraits` | Optional | Any other organization traits you want to pass along with the `group` call. |\n| `options` | `RudderOption` | Optional | Extra options to be passed along with `group` event. |\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack doesn’t persist the group traits across the sessions.\n\n## Alias\n\nThe `alias` call lets you merge different identities of a known user.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> `alias` is an advanced method that lets you change the tracked user’s ID explicitly. This method is useful when managing identities for some of the downstream destinations.\n\nFor a detailed explanation of the `alias` call, refer to the [RudderStack Event Specification](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/alias/) guide.\n\nA sample `alias` call is as shown:\n\n```\nrudderClient.alias(\"new_user_id\", options: null);\n```\n\nThe `alias` method has the following signature:\n\n| Name | Data Type | Presence | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `newId` | String | Required | The new `userId` you want to assign to the user. |\n| `options` | `RudderOption` | Optional | Extra options to be passed along with `alias` event. |\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack replaces the old `userId` with the `newUserId` and persists this identification across the sessions.\n\n## Reset\n\nYou can use the `reset` method to clear the persisted `traits` for the `identify` call. This is required for scenarios where the user logs out of a session.\n\nRudderStack gives the users (for example, an EU user) the ability to opt out of tracking any user activity until the user gives their consent. You can do this by leveraging RudderStack’s `optOut` API.\n\nThe `optOut` API takes `true` or `false` as a Boolean value to enable or disable tracking user activities. This flag persists across device reboots.\n\nThe following snippet highlights the use of the `optOut` API to disable user tracking:\n\n```\nrudderClient.optOut(true);\n```\n\nOnce the user grants their consent, you can enable user tracking once again by using the `optOut` API with `false` as a parameter sent to it:\n\n```\nrudderClient.optOut(false);\n```\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> The `optOut` API is available in the Flutter SDK starting from version `1.0.6`.\n\n## Filtering events\n\nWhen sending events to a destination via [device mode](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#device-mode), you can explicitly specify the events to be discarded or allowed to flow through by allowlisting or denylisting them.\n\nRefer to the [Client-side Event Filtering](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/event-filtering/) guide for more information on this feature.\n\n## Enabling/disabling events for specific destinations\n\nThe Flutter SDK lets you enable or disable sending events to a specific destination or all destinations connected to a source. You can specify these destinations by creating an object as shown in the following snippet:\n\n```\nRudderOption options = new RudderOption();\n// default value for `All` is true\noptions.putIntegration(\"All\", false);\n// specifying destination by its display name\noptions.putIntegration(\"Mixpanel\", false);\n// specifying destination by its Factory object\noptions.putIntegrationWithFactory(Appcenter(), true);\n```\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> The keyword `All` in the above snippet represents all destinations connected to a source. Its value is set to `true` by default.\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Make sure the destination names that you pass while specifying the destinations exactly match the names as listed in the [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/directory).\n\nYou can pass the destinations to the SDK in the following two ways:\n\n### Method 1. Passing destinations while initializing the SDK\n\nThis is helpful when you want to enable/disable sending the events across all event calls made using the SDK to the specified destination(s).\n\n```\nrudderClient.initialize(<WRITE_KEY>,\n                    config: builder.build(),options: options);\n```\n\n### Method 2. Passing destinations while making event calls\n\nThis approach is helpful when you want to enable/disable sending only a particular event to the specified destination(s) or if you want to override the specified destinations passed with the SDK initialization for a particular event.\n\n```\nRudderProperty property = RudderProperty();\nproperty.put(\"test_key_1\", \"test_key_1\");\nrudderClient.track(\"test_track_event\", properties: property, options: options);\n```\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> If you specify the destinations both while initializing the SDK as well as while making an event call, then the destinations specified at the event level only will be considered.\n\n## Setting a custom ID\n\nYou can pass a custom ID along with the standard `userId` in your `identify` calls. RudderStack adds this value under `context.externalId`.\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> RudderStack supports passing `externalId` only in the `identify` events. You must not pass this ID in other API calls like `track`, `page`, etc.\n\nThe following snippet shows how to add `externalId` to your `identify` event:\n\n```\nRudderOption option = RudderOption();\noption.putExternalId(\"externalId\", \"some_external_id_1\");\nrudderClient.identify(\"1hKOmRA4GRlm\", options: option);\n```\n\n## Setting your own `anonymousId` using `putAnonymousId`\n\nBy default, RudderStack uses `deviceId` as `anonymousId`. You can use the following method to override and set your own `anonymousId` with the SDK:\n\n```\nrudderClient.putAnonymousId(<ANONYMOUS_ID>);\n```\n\n## Setting the advertisement ID\n\nRudderStack collects the advertisement ID **only** if `autoCollectAdvertId` is set to `true` during the [SDK initialization](#initializing-the-rudderstack-client):\n\n```\nfinal RudderController rudderClient = RudderController.instance;\nMobileConfig mobileConfig = MobileConfig(autoCollectAdvertId: true);\nRudderLogger.init(RudderLogger.VERBOSE);\nRudderConfigBuilder builder = RudderConfigBuilder();\nbuilder.withDataPlaneUrl(<DATA_PLANE_URL>);\nbuilder.withTrackLifecycleEvents(true);\nrudderClient.initialize(<WRITE_KEY>,config: builder.build());\n```\n\nYou can use the `putAdvertisingId` method to pass your Android and iOS AAID and IDFA respectively.\n\nThe `putAdvertisingId` method accepts a string argument as listed below:\n\n*   `id` : Your Android advertisement ID (AAID) or your iOS advertisement ID (IDFA).\n\nThe following snippet highlights the use of `putAdvertisingId()`:\n\n```\nrudderClient.putAdvertisingId(<ADVERTISING_ID>);\n```\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> The `id` parameter that you pass in the `putAdvertisingId` method is assigned as the AAID (for Android) or as the IDFA (for iOS).\n\n## Setting the device token\n\nYou can pass your device token for push notifications to be passed to the destinations which support the Push Notification feature. RudderStack sets the token under `context.device.token`.\n\nAn example of setting the device token is as shown below:\n\n```\nrudderClient.putDeviceToken(<DEVICE_TOKEN>);\n```\n\n### Self-hosted control plane\n\nIn case you are using a device mode destination like Adjust, Firebase, etc., the Flutter SDK needs to fetch the required configuration from the control plane. If you are using the [Control plane lite](https://github.com/rudderlabs/config-generator#rudderstack-control-plane-lite) utility to host your own control plane, then follow the steps in [this section](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/get-started/rudderstack-open-source/control-plane-lite/#using-sdk-sources-set-up-in-self-hosted-control-plane) and specify `controlPlaneUrl` in your [`RudderConfig.Builder`](#configuring-your-rudderstack-client) that points to your hosted source configuration file.\n\n> ![danger](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/danger.svg)\n> \n> Do not pass the `controlPlaneUrl` parameter during SDK initialization if you are using [RudderStack Cloud](https://app.rudderstack.com/). This parameter is supported only if you are using the open-source [Control plane lite](https://github.com/rudderlabs/config-generator#rudderstack-control-plane-lite) utility to set up your own control plane.\n\n## Debugging\n\nIf you run into any issues when using the Flutter SDK, you can turn on the `VERBOSE` or `DEBUG` logging to determine the issue. To do so, follow these steps:\n\n1.  First, make sure you import `RudderLogger` by running the following command:\n\n```\nimport 'package:rudder_sdk_flutter/RudderLogger.dart';\n```\n\n2.  Then, turn on the logging by changing your `rudderClient` initialization as shown:\n\n```\nRudderConfigBuilder builder = RudderConfigBuilder();\nbuilder.withDataPlaneUrl(DATA_PLANE_URL);\nbuilder.withLogLevel(RudderLogger.VERBOSE);\nrudderClient.initialize(WRITE_KEY,config: builder.build());\n```\n\nYou can set the log level to one of the following values:\n\n*   `NONE`\n*   `ERROR`\n*   `WARN`\n*   `INFO`\n*   `DEBUG`\n*   `VERBOSE`\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### How do I get the user `traits` after making an `identify` call?\n\nYou can get the user traits after making an `identify` call in the following way:\n\n```\nMap context = await rudderClient.getRudderContext();\nprint(context[\"traits\"]);\n```\n\n#### Do I need to add anything to my Android ProGuard rules?\n\nIf you are facing any event delivery issues in your production environment, verify if you have added the following line in your ProGuard rules:\n\n```\n// Reporter Module\n-keep class com.rudderstack.android.ruddermetricsreporterandroid.models.LabelEntity { *; }\n-keep class com.rudderstack.android.ruddermetricsreporterandroid.models.MetricEntity { *; }\n-keep class com.rudderstack.android.ruddermetricsreporterandroid.models.ErrorEntity { *; }\n\n// Required for the usage off TypeToken class in Utils.converToMap, Utils.convertToList\n-keep class com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken { *; }\n-keep class * extends com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken\n\n// Required for the serialization of SourceConfig once it is downloaded.\n-keep class com.google.gson.internal.LinkedTreeMap { *; }\n-keep class * implements java.io.Serializable { *; }\n-keep class com.rudderstack.rudderjsonadapter.RudderTypeAdapter { *; }\n-keep class * extends com.rudderstack.rudderjsonadapter.RudderTypeAdapter\n\n// Required to ensure the DefaultPersistenceProviderFactory is not removed by Proguard \n// and works as expected even when the customer is not using encryption feature.\n-dontwarn net.sqlcipher.Cursor\n-dontwarn net.sqlcipher.database.SQLiteDatabase$CursorFactory\n-dontwarn net.sqlcipher.database.SQLiteDatabase\n-dontwarn net.sqlcipher.database.SQLiteOpenHelper\n-keep class com.rudderstack.android.sdk.core.persistence.DefaultPersistenceProviderFactory { *; }\n\n// Required for the usage of annotations across reporter and web modules\n-dontwarn com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonIgnore\n-dontwarn com.squareup.moshi.Json\n-dontwarn com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonProperty\n\n// Required for Device Mode Transformations\n-keep class com.rudderstack.android.sdk.core.TransformationResponse { *; }\n-keep class com.rudderstack.android.sdk.core.TransformationResponseDeserializer { *; }\n```\n\nQuestions?

Hence, you need to specify it while setting the prefix.\n\n*   **Schedule Settings**: RudderStack gives you three options to ingest the data from Facebook Marketing:\n    *   **Basic**: Runs the syncs at the specified time interval.\n    *   **CRON**: Runs the syncs based on the user-defined CRON expression.\n    *   **Manual**: You are required to run the syncs manually.\n\n### Selecting the data to import\n\nYou can choose the Facebook Marketing data you want to ingest by selecting the required resources:\n\n[![Selecting the data to import](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/cloud-extract-sources/fb-marketing-resources.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/cloud-extract-sources/fb-marketing-resources.webp)\n\nThe below table mentions the syncs supported by these resources from Facebook Marketing to your warehouse destination:\n\n| Resource | Sync type | Facebook Marketing API endpoint |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `activities` | Incremental | [`ad_activity`](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/reference/ad-activity) |\n| `ad_account` | Full Refresh | [`adaccount`](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/reference/ad-account) |\n| `ad_creatives` | Full Refresh | [`ad-creative`](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/reference/ad-creative) |\n| `ad_sets` | Incremental | [`ad-campaign`](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/reference/ad-campaign) |\n| `ads` | Incremental | [`ad-group`](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/reference/adgroup) |\n| `ads_insights` | Incremental | [`insights`](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/reference/adgroup/insights/) |\n| `campaigns` | Incremental | [`campaigns`](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/reference/ad-account/campaigns/) |\n| `custom_conversions` | Incremental | [`customconversions`](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/reference/custom-conversion) |\n| `images` | Incremental | [`ad-image`](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/reference/ad-image) |\n| `videos` | Incremental | [`videos`](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/video/video_insights/) |\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> For more information on the **Full Refresh** and **Incremental** sync modes, see [Common Settings](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/extract/common-settings/).\n\nFacebook Marketing is now configured as a source. RudderStack will start ingesting data from Facebook Marketing as per your specified schedule and frequency.\n\nYou can further connect this source to your data warehouse by clicking on **Add Destination**:\n\n[![Adding a destination](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/cloud-extract-sources/add-destination.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/cloud-extract-sources/add-destination.webp)\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> Use the **Use Existing Destination** option if you have an already-configured data warehouse destination in RudderStack. To configure a data warehouse destination from scratch, select the **Create New Destination** button.\n\n## FAQ\n\nYes - RudderStack implements a feature wherein it associates a table prefix for every Cloud Extract source writing to a warehouse schema. This way, multiple Cloud Extract sources can write to the same schema with different table prefixes.\n\n#### How can I avoid sync errors due to rate limits?\n\nTo avoid sync errors due to rate limits, set the **Page Size of Requests** setting to 500 from the default value of 50. This allows RudderStack to make fewer calls to the Facebook API. Note that the maximum value for this setting is 1000.\n\nRudderStack counts the number of records returned by the source APIs when queried during each sync. It considers each record as an event.\n\nRudderStack sets the table name for the resource you are syncing to the warehouse by adding `rudder_` to the **Table prefix** you set while configuring your Cloud Extract source in the dashboard.\n\n[![Cloud Extract table prefix](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/cloud-extract-sources/etl-table-prefix.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/cloud-extract-sources/etl-table-prefix.webp)\n\nFor example, if you set `test_` as the **Table prefix** in the dashboard, RudderStack sets the table name as `test_rudder_<resource_name>`, where `<resource_name>` is the name of the resource you are syncing (for example, `contacts`, `messages`, etc.).\n\n> ![warning](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/warning.svg)\n> \n> Note that RudderStack does not add the character `_` to the prefix by default. Hence, you need to specify it while setting the prefix.\n\nQuestions? Contact us by [email](mailto:docs@rudderstack.com) or on [Slack](https://rudderstack.com/join-rudderstack-slack-community)",

You can now either:\n\n1.  Override the `clientID` & `sessionID` with a RudderStack ID, or\n2.  Incorporate a JS SDK buffering option.\n\n### Why did we build this?\n\nThe GA4 hybrid mode solution works by sending `page` calls via device mode and all other events via cloud mode. These events need to be stitched together, relying on `clientID` and `sessionID` to send complete event data.\n\nIn our original implementation, we fetched the `clientID` and `sessionID` from `gtag.js`. Soon we discovered that sending the data this way led to a race condition whereby events sent via cloud mode were potentially reaching GA4 in advance of events sent device mode—which meant that events would not be properly stitched together.\n\n### How does it work?\n\n**Option 1 \\[recommended\\]**: Override the `clientID` and `sessionID` with the RudderStack ID.\n\nIn this option, RudderStack overrides the client ID with the RudderStack `anonymousID`. This means that we utilize a generated cookie that adds an `rs_` prefix to the existing Measurement ID. Similarly, RudderStack overrides the session ID with the RudderStack session ID.\n\n1.  In your configuration settings in the RudderStack dashboard, make sure that you select **Hybrid mode** for your GA4 connection mode.\n    \n2.  Toggle on the **Override gtag client ID & session ID** setting in your Web SDK configuration settings.\n    \n\n[![GA4 ID override setting](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/releases/ga4-hybrid.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/releases/ga4-hybrid.webp)\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> If you are switching from device mode, there may be a momentary spike in session counts as a result of this changeover. To ensure accurate cross-platform analytics, be sure to check that other cookies (such as Google Ads) include the appropriate `rs_` prefix.\n\n**Option 2**: Instrument a buffer in the JS SDK.\n\nIn this option, RudderStack fetches both the `clientID` and `sessionID` from `gtag.js`. In this scenario, however, you must instrument a custom snippet within the JS SDK to buffer, that is, delay events by ~2 seconds in order to ensure that device and cloud mode events are stitched together, avoiding the race condition.\n\nIncorporate the following snippet in your SDK:\n\n```\nrudderanalytics.load( \"write_key\", \"dataplane_url\", { bufferDataPlaneEventsUntilReady: true } )\n```\n\n> ![info](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/info.svg)\n> \n> This means there could be a ~2 second delay in events being sent (though those events will be queued to prevent event data loss). Also note that this buffering occurs on client side, with a 10 second timeout, meaning that any events which are not able to reach GA4 after 10 seconds will be dropped.\n\nSee our [GA4 hybrid mode](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/google-analytics-4/hybrid-mode/) documentation for further details on this integration.\n\nQuestions?

It is a subset of instances of an entity meeting a specified set of characteristics, behaviors, or attributes. For example, if you have a user as an entity, you can define cohorts like known users, new users, or North American users, etc.\n\n[![Activation API](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/profiles/cohorts-view-ui.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/profiles/cohorts-view-ui.webp)\n\nBy leveraging cohorts, you can target specific customer segments by enabling targeted campaigns and analysis. See [Cohorts](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/profiles/cohorts/) for more information.\n\n## Activations\n\nActivations provide business users the access to explore the customer 360, build audiences from cohorts, and sync them directly to the desired destinations. This helps you make informed decisions, run personalized marketing campaigns, and enhance the overall customer experience across multiple platforms.\n\n[![Activation](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/profiles/activation-view-ui.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/profiles/activation-view-ui.webp)\n\nSee [Activations](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/profiles/activations/) for more information.\n\nQuestions?

    "markdown": "# Reverse ETL Improvements | RudderStack Docs\n\nFaster syncs, improved error handling, and enhanced user interface and monitoring for Reverse ETL pipelines.\n\nAvailable Plans\n\n*   free\n*   starter\n*   growth\n*   enterprise\n\n* * *\n\n*     3 minute read  \n    \n\nWe have revamped RudderStack’s [Reverse ETL](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/data-pipelines/reverse-etl/) feature with several enhancements for better reliability, observability, and usability. These include faster syncs, improved error handling, and an enhanced UI.\n\n## Reliability\n\n### Faster syncs\n\nYou can now sync data faster with clear indicators marked for the succeeded, failed, and dropped events and the number of deltas in each sync. This also reduces the likelihood of syncs getting stuck due to warehouse errors.\n\n[![](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/releases/faster-syncs-retl.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/releases/faster-syncs-retl.webp)\n\n### Error categorization\n\nThe RudderStack dashboard is now updated to show comprehensive and user-friendly error messages more prominently, with suggested actions to fix them. This makes troubleshooting errors easier for users without needing help or support from the RudderStack team.\n\n### Adaptive rate limiting\n\nWhenever a sync hits a destination’s rate limit, RudderStack automatically adjusts the rate of sending events so that you do not encounter any 429 errors and the pipeline continues at a steady pace.\n\n### Mirror mode redesign\n\nThe [mirror mode](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/reverse-etl/sync-schedule-settings/#mirror-mode) for syncing events is now faster and more reliable.\n\n### Async API\n\nWe have introduced the Async API to reduce the likelihood of encountering a timeout error while running the warehouse queries to fetch preview, columns, tables, etc., during the creation of a Reverse ETL model, audience, or a sync.\n\n### Scalable retries for failed records\n\nRudderStack now retries syncs for failed records scalably while maintaining a cap on the number of retries. You can also turn on/off your sync retries based on the error category.\n\n### Batch support and bulk data upload\n\nWe have optimized our top [Event Stream destinations](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/streaming-destinations/) to incorporate batch APIs (wherever possible) to handle large volumes of data - a very common scenario in Reverse ETL syncs.\n\n## Observability\n\n### Health dashboard\n\nYou can now monitor the health of your syncs using the [Health dashboard](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/data-governance/health-dashboard/), which summarizes the status of the latest sync providing details like:\n\n*   Status and duration of the latest sync\n*   Failures (Percentage of deltas (new rows) that failed to sync)\n*   Invalids (Invalid records sent from the source)\n*   Summary of failed or aborted syncs in the selected duration (1 day, 1 week, or 1 month)\n\n[![Reverse ETL tab overview](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/features/health-dashboard/retl-sync-overview.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/features/health-dashboard/retl-sync-overview.webp)\n\n### Alerts\n\nYou can set [alerts and notifications](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/data-governance/alerts/) to your preferred channel (such as Slack, Microsoft Teams, webhook, email, Pagerduty, etc.) for fatal syncs. This gives greater visibility into the health and status of your Reverse ETL syncs, so you can proactively monitor and take action when required.\n\n[![Alerts option in RudderStack dashboard](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/data-governance/configurable-alerts/configurable-alerts-overview.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/data-governance/configurable-alerts/configurable-alerts-overview.webp)\n\n### Improved syncs page\n\nReverse ETL syncs page is revamped to provide more visibility into the status and progress of a sync. It displays details about the sync trend over time, so that at any point in time, you can see how many events are queued, succeeded, failed, or retrying.\n\n[![](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/releases/sync-page.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/releases/sync-page.webp)\n\n## Usability\n\n### One-to-many connections\n\nRudderStack lets you connect a Reverse ETL source to multiple destinations so that you can sync data from the same source to different destinations with different settings.\n\n### Cancel and drain ongoing syncs\n\nYou can [cancel any ongoing sync](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/reverse-etl/start-stop-syncs/#start-and-stop-syncs) without turning off the source. RudderStack automatically triggers a [draining process](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/reverse-etl/start-stop-syncs/#drain-behavior-on-sync-cancellation) in the background once you stop the sync to make sure the next sync is not affected and you don’t have to wait for the events already in the pipeline to be delivered or failed.\n\n### Faster and clearer sync statuses\n\nWe have made several improvements in the overall event syncing process to improve user experience, like:\n\n*   Communicating the sync status clearly by updating the metrics at the same time when a sync is marked as complete.\n*   Reducing sync completion time significantly.\n*   Providing real-time feedback on the sync status\n*   Faster page load times to reduce any likelihood of timeouts when refreshing the syncs page or checking the sync history.\n*   Better navigation of past syncs, making them easy to find.\n\nQuestions?

Org Member roles can be further customized with resource roles, e.g. _Transformations Admin_ to provide granular access policies.\n\n### What changed?\n\nPrior to this release, our user roles consisted of Admin, Read-write, and Read-only, and gave broad access across all features throughout the RudderStack app. With this release, you can define granular access roles for teams that require more specific access policies.\n\n### Use case\n\nFor example, a user might be responsible for writing JavaScript transformations, but should not have access to controlling data pipelines. This user can be given the _Transformations Admin_ role, but will not be able to create, edit, or delete a source or destination.\n\n### How does it work?\n\nUsers are invited at the organization level and access policies are set during the invite process. Individual access policies can then be managed in _Organization Settings_ in the RudderStack dashboard under the _Members_ tab.\n\n[![Invite member](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/dashboard-guides/user-management/invite-user.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/dashboard-guides/user-management/invite-user.webp)\n\n### How do I get started?\n\nStart by navigating to the _Members_ tab in _Organization Settings_. This will give you a view of all the users in the organization, their roles, and their granular access policies.\n\nSee our [Members](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/dashboard-guides/user-management/) documentation to get started.\n\nQuestions?

You can also monitor violations across different tracking plan versions within the previous 30 days.\n\nTo access the tracking plan violations, go to the **Events** tab of your source and click **Violations** under **Event Details**. Here, you can view the number of validated events, their type, name, events that violate tracking plan rules, and dropped events.\n\n[![Tracking plan observability](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/data-governance/tracking-plans-observability.webp)](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/images/data-governance/tracking-plans-observability.webp)\n\n**Violation types**\n\nRudderStack defines five violation types:\n\n*   Additional-Properties\n*   Required-Missing\n*   Datatype-Mismatch\n*   Unplanned-Event\n*   Unknown-Violation\n\nNote that each event can have multiple violations. See [Violation types](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/data-governance/tracking-plans/#violation-types) in our tracking plans documentation to learn more.\n\n**Violation counts**\n\nRudderStack also provides the violation count for each violation type. For example, if a single event violates a property missing rule, the count captures multiple missing properties associated with that violation. See [Event details](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/data-governance/tracking-plans/#event-details) for more information.\n\nQuestions?
